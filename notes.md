**Steering Box (5-Series)**

Note: If you find that the steering box is defective, it is not recommended that you overhaul it. Because of the special tools needed to do the job, it is best to let your dealer service department overhaul it for you (otherwise, fit a new unit). Removal and refitting the steering box is outlined here.

1. On 5-Series E28 (“old-shape”) models, discharge the hydraulic system by depressing the brake pedal about 20 times.
2. Using a large syringe or hand pump, empty the power steering fluid reservoir (see Chapter 1).
3. Raise the front of the vehicle and support it securely on axle stands.
4. Support the front of the engine with a trolley jack. Place a block of wood between the jack head and the sump to protect the sump from damage.
5. Remove the pivot bolts from the inner ends of the front control arms (see Section 4).
6. Remove the nuts from the left and right engine mountings (see Chapter 2).
7. Remove the mounting bolts (two on each side on earlier models, three on each side on later models) from the subframe crossmember (see illustration) and remove the subframe.
8. Remove the nuts and bolts that secure the universal joint shaft to the steering box worm shaft. Slide the universal joint shaft up and off the worm shaft. Inspect the universal joint shaft for wear. If it’s stiff or worn, renew it.
9. Remove the banjo bolts, and disconnect the hydraulic pressure line and the return line from the box (see illustration). Plug the ends of the lines to prevent fluid loss and contamination. Discard the sealing washers - new ones should be used when reassembling.
10. Remove the steering box retaining bolts (see illustrations) and remove the steering box.
11. If it’s necessary to detach the Pitman arm from the box sector shaft (to have the box serviced or to switch the arm to a new or rebuilt unit), make a match mark across the two for correct reassembly. Remove the Pitman arm retaining nut and washer. Use a puller to withdraw the arm if necessary.

Refitting:

12. Refit the Pitman arm by aligning the match marks made during removal, then tighten the nut to the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
13. When fitted the Pitman arm must not have any measurable endfloat within 100° from the neutral position. If play exists, have the following parts checked:
a) Sector shaft and bearings (for wear)
b) Thrust washer and adjuster bolt head (for wear)
c) Ball nut and worm shaft (for wear)
14. Refit the steering box. Align the mark on the pinion gear shaft with the mark on the universal joint shaft, and tighten the steering box bolts to the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
15. The remainder of refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure to use new self-locking nuts on the universal joint shaft, the centre track rod, the steering box, and the crossmember. Also, use new sealing washers on the hydraulic line fittings.
16. Refer to Chapter 1 and fill the power steering reservoir with the recommended fluid, then bleed the system as described in Section 23. Check for leakage from the lines and connections.


**Power Steering System - Bleeding**

1. To bleed the power steering system, begin by checking the power steering fluid level and adding fluid if necessary (see Chapter 1).
2. Raise and support the front of the vehicle on axle stands.
3. Turn the steering wheel from lock-to-lock several times. Recheck the fluid level and top up if necessary.
4. Start the engine and run it at 1000 rpm or less. Turn the steering wheel from lock-to-lock again (three or four times) and recheck the fluid level one more time. Note: On 5-Series E28 (“old-shape”) models, pump the brake pedal five or six times before turning the steering wheel. Once the fluid level remains constant, continue turning the wheel back and forth until no more bubbles appear in the fluid in the reservoir.
5. Lower the vehicle to the ground. Run the engine and again turn the wheels from lock-to-lock several more times. Recheck the fluid level. Position the wheels straight-ahead.


**Power Steering Pump - Removal and Refitting**

1. Raise the vehicle and support it securely on axle stands. Remove the engine undertray.
2. On 5-Series E28 (“old-shape”) models, discharge the hydraulic system by depressing the brake pedal about 20 times before loosening the hydraulic line fittings.
3. Disconnect the fluid return hose, and drain the power steering fluid from the reservoir into a clean container. Disconnect the pressure line from the pump.
4. If you need to remove the pulley from the pump, push on the power steering pump drivebelt by hand to increase the tension, and unscrew the pulley nuts or bolts.
5. Loosen the power steering pump drivebelt tensioner bolt, and remove the drivebelt (see Chapter 1).
6. Remove the mounting bolts (see illustrations) and detach the power steering pump.

8. Top-up the fluid level in the reservoir (see Chapter 1) and bleed the system (see Section 23).


**Steering Linkage (5-Series) - Inspection, Removal, and Refitting**

Inspection:

1. Raise the vehicle and place it securely on axle stands.
2. Firmly grasp each front tyre at the top and bottom, then at the front and rear, and check for play in the steering linkage by rocking the tyre back and forth. There should be little or no play in any of the linkage balljoints. Inspect the Pitman arm, the idler arm, the centre track rod, the inner track rods, the track rod ends, and the steering arms for any obvious damage. Try forcing the linkage parts in opposite directions from one another. There should be no play between any of them. If any of the parts are bent or damaged in any way, or if any of the balljoints are worn, renew the parts concerned.

Removal:

3. Before dismantling the steering linkage, obtain a suitable balljoint separator. A two-jaw puller or a wedge-type tool will work (although the wedge-type tends to tear the balljoint boots). Sometimes, you can also jar a balljoint taper pin free from its eye by striking opposite sides of the eye simultaneously with two large hammers, but the space available to do this is limited, and the balljoint stud sometimes sticks to the eye because of rust and dirt. There is also a risk of damaging the component being struck.
4. To remove the outer track rods, disconnect the track rod ends from the steering arms (see Section 17). Remove the nut that attaches the balljoint on the inner end of each outer track rod to the centre track rod. Using a balljoint separator, disconnect the outer track rods from the centre track rod. If you’re renewing the balljoint at either end of the outer track rods, paint or scribe alignment marks on the threads to mark their respective positions as a guide to adjustment during reassembly (see illustration 17.3).
5. To remove the centre track rod, remove the nuts that attach the centre track rod balljoints to the Pitman arm and the idler arm, and use a balljoint separator to disconnect the balljoints from the two arms.
6. To remove the Pitman arm, you’ll have to remove the steering box first (see Section 21). Look for match marks between the sector shaft and arm. If there aren’t any, scribe a mark across the bottom face of both parts. Remove the Pitman arm pinch-bolt and nut, then remove the arm with a puller.
7. To unbolt the idler arm, first remove the small cover bolted to the top of the subframe crossmember. Put a spanner on the bolt, and remove the nut recessed into the underside of the subframe crossmember (see illustration). Check the idler arm rubber bush for wear. If it’s damaged or worn, renew it.

Refitting:

9. Refitting is the reverse of the removal procedure, but observe the following points:
a) Realign the match marks on the Pitman arm and the steering box sector shaft when reassembling them.
b) If you’re fitting new inner or outer track rod ends on the outer track rods, position them so that the match marks made during dismantling are aligned, and make sure they are equally spaced on each side.
c) Position the track rod end balljoint studs on the outer track rods at an angle of 90° to each other.
d) Make sure the left and right outer track rods are equal in length when they are fitted.
e) Tighten all retaining bolts to the torque values listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
f) When reassembly of the linkage is complete, have the front wheel alignment checked, and if necessary, adjusted.

**Rack-and-Pinion Steering Gear (3-Series) - Removal and Refitting**

Removal:

1. Loosen but do not remove the wheel bolts, raise the vehicle, and support it securely on axle stands. Remove the front wheels.
2. Mark the lower universal joint on the steering shaft and the pinion shaft, to ensure proper alignment when they’re reassembled. Remove the nut and bolt that attach the lower end of the universal joint shaft to the steering gear pinion shaft. Loosen the bolt and nut at the upper end of the universal joint shaft. Slide the universal joint shaft up a little, disengage it from the pinion shaft, and remove it. Inspect the universal joints and the rubber coupling for wear. If any of them are worn or defective, renew the universal joint shaft.
3. On power steering models, using a large syringe or hand pump, empty the power steering fluid reservoir.

Refitting:

8. Refitting is the reverse of removal. Make sure the marks you made on the lower universal joint and the pinion shaft are aligned before you tighten the clamping bolts for the upper and lower universal joints. Use new self-locking nuts on the steering rack mounting bolts, and new sealing washers on the hydraulic line fittings. Tighten the mounting bolts, the track rod end nuts, and the universal joint shaft clamping bolts to the torque values listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
9. Lower the vehicle to the ground.
10. On power steering models, fill the reservoir with the recommended fluid (see Chapter 1) and bleed the power steering system (see Section 23).
11. It’s a good idea to have the front wheel alignment checked by a dealer service department or qualified garage.


**Power Steering Fluid Level Check**

Caution: Do not hold the steering wheel against either stop (full-left or full-right lock) for more than five seconds. If you do, the power steering pump could be damaged.

2 On some models, the power steering fluid reservoir is located on the left side of the engine compartment, and has a twist-off cap with an integral fluid level dipstick (see illustration). Other models use a hydraulic power steering and brake servo system which combines the fluid in one reservoir, located at the right rear corner of the engine compartment.
3 Park the vehicle on level ground, and apply the handbrake.
4 On models with a fluid dipstick, run the engine until it has reached normal operating temperature. With the engine at idle, turn the steering wheel back and forth several times to get any air out of the steering system. Switch off the engine, remove the cap by turning it anti-clockwise, wipe the dipstick clean, and refit the cap. Remove the cap again, and note the fluid level. It must be between the two lines (see illustration).
5 On hydraulic servo models, pump the brake pedal about ten times or until the pedal is firm. Remove the nut, lift the cap off, and make sure the fluid is within 6.0 mm of the top of the reservoir.
6 Add small amounts of fluid until the level is correct (see illustration).

7.6 Adding fluid to the power steering reservoir
7.4 The power steering fluid level should be kept between the two arrows near the upper step on the dipstick
7.2 The power steering fluid reservoir (arrowed) is located on the left side of the engine compartment


**Power Steering Hoses**
Check the power steering hoses for leaks, loose connections, and worn clamps. Tighten loose connections. Worn clamps or leaky hoses should be renewed.


**Rack-and-Pinion Steering Gear (3-Series) - Removal and Refitting**
The rack-and-pinion steering gear should be removed and refitted in the following manner:

Removal:
1. Loosen but do not remove the wheel bolts, raise the vehicle and support it securely on axle stands. Remove the front wheels.
2. Mark the lower universal joint on the steering shaft and the pinion shaft, to ensure proper alignment when they’re reassembled. Remove the nut and bolt that attach the lower end of the universal joint shaft to the steering gear pinion shaft. Loosen the bolt and nut at the upper end of the universal joint shaft. Slide the universal joint shaft up a little, disengage it from the pinion shaft, and remove it. Inspect the universal joints and the rubber coupling for wear. If any of them are worn or defective, renew the universal joint shaft.
3. On power steering models, using a large syringe or hand pump, empty the power steering fluid reservoir.
4. On power steering models, remove the banjo bolts and disconnect the power steering pressure and return lines from the steering gear.
