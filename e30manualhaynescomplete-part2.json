        "5 Ignition system - general\nThe ignition system includes the ignition\nswitch, the battery, the distributor, the primary\n(low-voltage/low-tension or LT) and\nsecondary (high-voltage/high-tension or HT)\nwiring circuits, the spark plugs and the spark\nplug leads. Models fitted with a carburettor or\nL-Jetronic fuel injection are equipped with a\nTransistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system.\nModels fitted with the Motronic fuel injection\nsystem have the ignition system incorporated\nwithin the Motronic system (Digital Motor\nElectronics or DME).",
        "Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI)\nsystem\nThis system is has four major components;\nthe impulse generator, the ignition control\nunit, the coil, and the spark plugs. The\nimpulse generator provides a timing signal for\nthe ignition system. Equivalent to cam-\nactuated breaker points in a standard\ndistributor, the impulse generator creates an\nA/C voltage signal every time the trigger\nwheel tabs pass the impulse generator tabs.\nWhen the ignition control unit (capacitive\ndischarge unit) receives the voltage signal, it\ntriggers a spark discharge from the coil by\ninterrupting the primary coil circuit. The\nignition dwell (coil charging time) is adjusted\nby the ignition control unit for the most\nintense spark. Note: The air gap (distance\nbetween the impulse generator and trigger\nwheel tabs) can be adjusted (see Section 11).\nIgnition timing is mechanically adjusted\n(see Section 7). A centrifugal advance unit\nthat consists of spring-loaded rotating\nweights advances ignition timing as engine\nspeed increases. The vacuum advance\nadjusts ignition timing to compensate for\nchanges in engine load.",
        "Motronic ignition system\nThis system, also known as Digital Motor\nElectronics (DME), incorporates all ignition\nand fuel injection functions into one central\ncontrol unit or ECU (computer). The ignition\ntiming is based on inputs the ECU receives for\nengine load, engine speed, coolant\ntemperature and intake air temperature. The\nonly function the distributor performs is the\ndistribution of the high voltage signal to the\nindividual spark plugs. The distributor is\nattached directly to the cylinder head. There is\nno mechanical spark advance system used on\nthese systems.\nIgnition timing is electronically-controlled,\nand is not adjustable on Motronic systems.\nDuring starting, a crankshaft position sensor\n(reference sensor) relays the crankshaft\nposition to the ECU, and an initial baseline\nignition point is determined. Once the engine\nis running, the ignition timing is continually\nchanging, based on the various input signals\nto the ECU. Engine speed is signalled by a\nspeed sensor. Early Motronic systems have\nthe position reference sensor and the speed\nsensor mounted on the bellhousing over the\nflywheel on the left-hand side. Later Motronic\nsystems have a single sensor (pulse sensor)\nmounted over the crankshaft pulley. This\nsensor functions as a speed sensor as well as\na position reference sensor. Refer to Sec-\ntion 12 for checking and renewing the ignition\nsensors. Note: Some models are equipped\nwith a TDC sensor mounted on the front of the\nengine. This sensor is strictly for the BMW\nservice test unit, and it is not part of the\nMotronic ignition system.",
        "Precautions\nCertain precautions must be observed\nwhen working on a transistorised ignition\nsystem.\na) Do not disconnect the battery cables\nwhen the engine is running\nb) Make sure the ignition control unit (TCI\nignition system) is always well earthed\n(see Section 10).\nc) Keep water away from the distributor and\nHT leads.\nd) If a tachometer is to be connected to the\nengine, always connect the tachometer\npositive (+) lead to the ignition coil\nnegative terminal (-) and never to the\ndistributor.\ne) Do not allow the coil terminals to be\nearthed, as the impulse generator or coil\ncould be damaged.\nf) Do not leave the ignition switch on for\nmore than ten minutes with the engine\noff, or if the engine will not start.",
        "6 Ignition system - check 2\nWarning: Because of the high\nvoltage generated by the ignition\nsystem, extreme care should be\ntaken whenever an operation is\nperformed involving ignition components.\nThis not only includes the impulse\ngenerator (electronic ignition), coil,\ndistributor and spark plug HT leads, but\nrelated components such as spark plug\nconnectors, tachometer and other test\nequipment.\n1 If the engine turns over but will not start,\ndisconnect the spark plug HT lead from any\nspark plug, and attach it to a calibrated spark\ntester (available at most car accessory \nshops). \nNote: There are two different types of spark\ntesters. Be sure to specify electronic\n(breakerless) ignition. Connect the clip on the\ntester to an earth point such as a metal\nbracket (see illustration).\n2 If you are unable to obtain a calibrated\nspark tester, remove the spark plug HT lead\nfrom one of the spark plugs. Using an\ninsulated tool, hold the lead about a quarter-\ninch from the engine block - make sure the\ngap is not more than a quarter-inch, or\ndamage may be caused to the electronic\ncomponents.\n3 Crank the engine, and observe the tip of the\ntester or spark plug HT lead to see if a spark\noccurs. If bright-blue, well-defined sparks\noccur, sufficient voltage is reaching the plugs\nto fire the engine. However, the plugs\nthemselves may be fouled, so remove and\ncheck them as described in Chapter 1.\n4 If there's no spark, check another HT lead\nin the same manner. A few sparks followed by\nno spark is the same condition as no spark at\nall.\n5 If no spark occurs, remove the distributor\ncap, and check the cap and rotor as\ndescribed in Chapter 1. If moisture is present,\nuse a water-dispersant aerosol (or something\nsimilar) to dry out the cap and rotor, then refit\nthe cap and repeat the spark test.\n6 If there's still no spark, disconnect the coil\nHT lead from the distributor cap, and \ntest this lead as described for the spark plug\nleads.\n7 If no spark occurs, check the primary wire\nconnections at the coil to make sure they're\nclean and tight. Make any necessary repairs,\nthen repeat the check.\n8 If sparks do occur from the coil HT lead, the\ndistributor cap, rotor, plug HT lead(s) or spark\nplug(s) may be defective. If there's still no\nspark, the coil-to-cap HT lead may be\ndefective. If a substitute lead doesn't make\nany difference, check the ignition coil (see\nSection 9). Note: Refer to Sections 10 and 11\nfor more test procedures on the distributors\nfitted with the TCI ignition system.",
        "Engine electrical systems  5*3\n6.1  To use a spark tester, simply\ndisconnect a spark plug HT lead, clip the\ntester to a convenient earth (like a valve\ncover bolt or nut) and operate the starter -\nif there is enough power to fire the plug,\nsparks will be visible between the\nelectrode tip and the tester body",
        "7 Ignition timing (TCI system) -\ncheck and adjustment 4\nWarning: Keep hands, equipment\nand wires well clear of the\nviscous cooling fan during\nadjustment of the ignition timing.\nNote: This Section describes the procedure\nfor checking and adjusting the ignition timing\non engines fitted with the TCI system. On\nengines fitted with the Motronic engine\nmanagement system, the ignition timing is\ncontrolled by the electronic control unit, and\nno adjustment is possible. The timing can be\nchecked using the following procedure, but no\nignition timing values were available at the\ntime of writing. If the timing is thought to be\nincorrect, refer to a BMW dealer.\n1 Some special tools are required for this\nprocedure (see illustration). The engine must\nbe at normal operating temperature, and the\nair conditioning (where fitted) must be\nswitched off. Make sure the idle speed is\ncorrect.\n2 Apply the handbrake, and chock the wheels\nto prevent movement of the vehicle. The\ntransmission must be in neutral (manual) or\nPark (automatic).\n3 The timing marks are located on the engine\nflywheel (viewed through the timing check\nhole in the bellhousing) and/or on the vibration\ndamper on the front of the engine.\n4 Where applicable, disconnect the vacuum\nhose from the distributor vacuum advance\nunit.\n5 Connect a tachometer and timing light\naccording to the equipment manufacturer's\ninstructions (an inductive pick-up timing light\nis preferred). Generally, the power leads for\nthe timing light are attached to the battery\nterminals, and the pick-up lead is attached to\nthe No 1 spark plug HT lead. The No 1 spark\nplug is the one at the front of the engine.\nCaution: If an inductive pick-up\ntiming light isn't available, don't\npuncture the spark plug HT lead\nto attach the timing light pick-up\nlead. Instead, use an adapter between the\nspark plug and HT lead. If the insulation on\nthe HT lead is damaged, the secondary\nvoltage will jump to earth at the damaged\npoint, and the engine will misfire.\nNote: On some models, a TDC transmitter is\nfitted for checking the ignition system.\nHowever, a special BMW tester must be\nconnected to the diagnostic socket to use it,\nso unless the special tester is available, a\nconventional timing light should be used. The\nignition timing mark may be on the vibration\ndamper, but if not, normally the TDC mark will\nbe. If the timing light is of the adjustable delay\ntype, then the ignition timing may be\ndetermined by zeroing the adjustment, then\nturning the adjustment until the TDC marks are\naligned, and then reading off the amount of\nadvance from the timing light. If a standard\ntiming light is being used, make a mark on the\nvibration damper in accordance with the\nspecified advance, using the following formula\nto calculate the distance from the TDC mark\nto the timing mark:\nDistance = 2Pr x advance\n360\nwhere P = 3.142\nr = radius of vibration damper\nadvance = specified advance \nBTDC in degrees\n6 With the ignition off, loosen the distributor\nclamp nut just enough to allow the distributor\nto pivot without any slipping.\n7 Make sure the timing light wires are routed\naway from the drivebelts and fan, then start\nthe engine.\n8 Raise the engine rpm to the specified\nspeed, and then point the flashing timing light\nat the timing marks - be very careful of moving\nengine components.\n9 The mark on the flywheel or vibration\ndamper will appear stationary. If it's aligned\nwith the specified point on the bellhousing or\nengine front cover, the ignition timing is\ncorrect (see illustrations).\n10 If the marks aren't aligned, adjustment is\nrequired. Turn the distributor very slowly until\nthe marks are aligned, taking care not to\ntouch the HT leads.\n11 Tighten the nut on the distributor clamp,\nand recheck the timing.\n12 Switch off the engine, and remove the\ntiming light and tachometer. Reconnect the\nvacuum hose where applicable.",
        "8 Distributor - \nremoval and refitting 4\nTCI system\nRemoval\n1 After carefully marking them for position,\nremove the coil HT lead and spark plug HT\nleads from the distributor cap (see Chapter 1).\n2 Remove No 1 spark plug (the one nearest\nyou when you are standing in front of the\nengine).\n3 Manually rotate the engine to Top Dead\nCentre (TDC) on the compression stroke for\nNo 1 piston (see Chapter 2A)\n4 Carefully mark the vacuum hoses, if more\nthan one is present on your distributor.\n5 Disconnect the vacuum hose(s).\n6 Disconnect the primary circuit wires from\nthe distributor.\n7 Mark the relationship of the rotor tip to the\ndistributor housing (see illustration).

        "9 Ignition coil -\ncheck and renewal 2\nCaution: Do not earth the coil, as\nthe coil and/or impulse generator\ncould be damaged.\nNote: On models equipped with the Motronic\nsystem, a faulty ECU can cause the ignition\ncoil to become damaged. Be sure to test the\nignition coil if the engine will not start and an\nECU fault is suspected.\n1 Mark the wires and terminals for position,\nthen remove the primary circuit wires and the\nHT lead from the coil.\n2 Remove the coil assembly from its\nmounting, then clean the outer casing and\ncheck it for cracks and other damage.\n3 Inspect the coil primary terminals and the\ncoil tower terminal for corrosion. Clean them\nwith a wire brush if any corrosion is found.\n4 Check the coil primary resistance by\nattaching an ohmmeter to the primary\nterminals (see illustrations). Compare the\nmeasured resistance to the Specifications\nlisted in this Chapter.\n5 Check the coil secondary resistance by\nconnecting one of the ohmmeter leads to one\nof the primary terminals, and the other\nohmmeter lead to the coil high-tension\nterminal (see illustrations). On TCI systems,\nEngine electrical systems  5*5\n8.19  Remove the rotor screws (arrowed)\nwith an Allen key, and pull the rotor off the\nshaft\n8.18  Remove the three bolts (arrowed)\nfrom the distributor cap\n8.7  Mark the relationship of the rotor to\nthe distributor housing (arrowed)\n9.5b  Using an ohmmeter, measure the\nsecondary resistance of the coil (later\nMotronic system)\n9.5a  Using an ohmmeter, measure the\nsecondary resistance of the coil (TCI\nsystem)\n9.4b  Some Motronic systems use a\ndifferent type of coil.

Compare the measured\nresistance with the values given in the Specifi-\ncations in this Chapter.\n6 If the measured resistances are not close to\nthose specified, the coil is defective and\nshould be renewed. Note that the measured\nresistance will vary according to the\ntemperature of the coil, so don't rush to\ncondemn the coil if the resistance is only a\nlittle way out.\n7 It is essential for proper ignition system\noperation that all coil terminals and wire leads\nbe kept clean and dry.\n8 Refit the coil in its mounting, and reconnect\nthe wiring. Refitting is the reverse of removal.",
        "10 Impulse generator and\nignition control unit - check\nand renewal (TCI system)\n3\n1 The impulse generator (located in the\ndistributor) and ignition control unit need to be\ntested in the event there is no spark at the\nspark plugs. Make sure the plug leads,\nignition coil and spark plugs are working\nproperly (see Sections 6 and 9). There are two\ntypes of control units; Bosch or\nSiemens/Telefunken. The two types (see\nillustration) can be distinguished by their\nelectrical connectors. The Bosch type uses a\nsingle, large rectangular connector at the\nbottom of the unit, while the\nSiemens/Telefunken control unit uses two\nround electrical connectors at the front of the\nunit.\nCheck\nVoltage supply and earth to ignition\ncontrol unit\n2 With the ignition off, remove the harness\nconnectors from the ignition control unit (see\nillustrations). Connect a voltmeter between\nconnector terminals 2 and 4 on Bosch\nsystems, or between terminals 6 and 3 on\nSiemens/Telefunken systems.\n3 Turn the ignition on. There should be\nbattery voltage on the designated terminals. If\nthere is no voltage, check the wiring harness\nfor an open-circuit (see Chapter 12).\n4 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity\nbetween connector terminal 2 (Bosch) or 6\n(Siemens/Telefunken) and the earth to the\nvehicle body. Continuity should exist.\n5 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity\nbetween connector terminal 4 (Bosch) or 3\n(Siemens/Telefunken) and terminal 15 of the\nignition coil. Continuity should exist.\n6 If the readings are incorrect, repair the\nwiring harness.\nImpulse generator signal\n7 If the ignition control unit is receiving\nbattery voltage, check the A/C signal voltage\ncoming from the impulse generator to the\ncontrol unit.\n5*6 Engine electrical systems\n10.2b  Check for voltage at terminals 6 and\n3 on the control unit electrical connector\n(Siemens/Telefunken system shown)\n10.2a  Check for voltage at terminals 2 and\n4 on the control unit electrical connector\n(Bosch system shown)\n1  Coil HT lead\n2  Ignition coil\n3  Spark plug HT lead\n4  Spark plug\n5  Ignition control unit (Bosch)\n6  Ignition control unit \n(Siemens/Telefunken)\n7  Wiring harness\n8  Distributor housing with \ncentrifugal advance \ncounterweights\n9  Vacuum diaphragm\n10  Circlip\n11  Impulse generator\n12  Trigger wheel\n13  Circlip\n14  Dust shield\n15  Ignition rotor\n16  Distributor\n17  Roll pin\n18  Trigger wheel and impulse \ngenerator tabs\n19  Cap retaining clip\n20  Impulse generator \n10.1  Schematic of the ignition components used on engines with the TCI system\n8 Use a digital voltmeter for the following\na) On Bosch systems, connect the positive\nprobe to connector terminal 5, and the\nnegative probe to terminal 6 (see\nb) On Siemens/Telefunken systems, connect\nthe positive probe to terminal (+) of the\nsmaller connector, and the negative\nprobe to terminal (-).\n9 Have an assistant crank the engine over,\nand check that there is 1 to 2 volts A/C\npresent. If there is no voltage, check the\nwiring harness between the impulse generator\n(in the distributor) and the control unit. If the\nharness is OK, check the impulse generator\nresistance.\nWarning: Do not crank the\nengine over for an excessive\nlength of time. If necessary,\ndisconnect the cold start injector\nelectrical connector (see Chapter 4) to\nstop the flow of fuel into the engine.\n10 To check the resistance in the impulse\ngenerator, proceed as described for your\nsystem below:\na) On Bosch units, measure the resistance\nbetween connector terminals 5 and 6\n(see illustration 10.8). The reading\nshould be 1000 to 1200 ohms.\nb) On Siemens/Telefunken units, measure\nthe resistance between the terminals of\nthe smaller connector. The reading should\nbe 1000 to 1200 ohms.\n11 If the resistance readings are incorrect,\nrenew the impulse generator. If the resistance\nreadings for the impulse generator are correct\nand the control unit voltages (supply voltage\n[paragraphs 1 to 6] and signal voltage\n[paragraphs 7 to 9]) are incorrect, renew the\ncontrol unit.\nRenewal\nIgnition control unit\n12 Make sure the ignition is switched off.\n13 Disconnect the electrical connector(s)\nfrom the control unit.\n14 Remove the mounting screws from the\ncontrol unit, and lift it from the engine\ncompartment.\n15 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:\nOn Bosch control units, a special dielectric\ngrease is used between the heat sink and the\nback of the control unit. In the event the two\nare separated (renewal or testing) the old\ngrease must be removed, and the heat sink\ncleaned off using 180-grit sandpaper. Apply\nCuril K2 (Bosch part number 81 22 9 243). A\nsilicon dielectric compound can be used as a\nsubstitute. This treatment is very important for\nthe long life of these expensive ignition parts.\nImpulse generator\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n16 Disconnect the battery negative cable.\n17 Remove the distributor from the engine\n(see Section 8).\n18 Using a pair of circlip pliers, remove the\ncirclip retaining the trigger wheel (see\n19 Use two flat-bladed screwdrivers\npositioned at opposite sides of the trigger\nwheel, and carefully prise it up (see\nillustration). Note: Push the screwdrivers in\nas far as possible without bending the trigger\nwheel. Prise only on the strongest, centre\nportion of the trigger wheel. In the event the\ntrigger wheel is bent, it must be replaced with\na new one. Note: Be sure not to lose the roll\npin when lifting out the trigger wheel.\n20 Remove the mounting screws from the\nimpulse generator electrical connector, the\nvacuum diaphragm and the baseplate.\n21 Remove the two screws from the vacuum\nadvance unit, and separate it from the\ndistributor by moving the assembly down\nwhile unhooking it from the baseplate pin.\n22 Use circlip pliers to remove the circlip that\nretains the impulse generator and the\nbaseplate assembly.\n23 Carefully remove the impulse generator\nand the baseplate assembly as a single unit.\n24 Remove the three screws, and separate\nthe baseplate assembly from the impulse\ngenerator.\n25 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:\nBe sure to position the insulating ring between\nthe generator coil and the baseplate. It must\nbe centred before tightening the mounting\nscrews. Also, it will be necessary to\ncheck/adjust the air gap if the trigger wheel\nhas been removed, or tampered with to the\npoint that the clearance is incorrect (see\nSection 11).",

        "13 Charging system - general\ninformation and precautions\nThere are two different types of alternator\nfitted on these models; Bosch and Motorola.\nAlso, there are three different amperage\nratings available; 65A, 80A or 90A. A stamped\nserial number on the rear of the alternator will\nidentify the type and amperage rating.\nPerform the charging system checks (see\nSection 14) to diagnose any problems with the\nalternator.\nThe voltage regulator and the alternator\nbrushes are mounted as a single assembly.\nOn Bosch alternators, this unit can be\nremoved from the alternator (see Section 16)\nand the components serviced individually.\nThe alternator on all models is mounted on\nthe left front of the engine, and utilises a V-\nbelt and pulley drive system. Drivebelt tension\nand battery servicing are the two primary\nmaintenance requirements for these systems.\nSee Chapter 1 for the procedures regarding\nengine drivebelt checking and battery\nservicing.\nThe ignition/no-charge warning light should\ncome on when the ignition key is turned to\nStart, then go off immediately the engine\nstarts. If it remains on, there is a malfunction\nin the charging system (see Section 14). Some\nvehicles are also equipped with a voltmeter. If\nthe voltmeter indicates abnormally high or low\nvoltage, check the charging system (see\nSection 14). Note: On models up to 1986, a\nblown ignition/no-charge warning light will\nprevent the alternator from charging. After\n1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the\nwarning light in order to allow current to\nbypass the light in the event of a broken circuit\n(blown warning light).\nPrecautions\nBe very careful when making electrical\ncircuit connections to the alternator, and note\nthe following:\na) When reconnecting wires to the alternator\nfrom the battery, be sure to note the\npolarity.\nb) Before using arc-welding equipment to\nrepair any part of the vehicle, disconnect\nthe wires from the battery terminals and\nfrom the alternator.\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\nc) Never start the engine with a battery\ncharger connected. Always disconnect\nboth battery cables before using a battery\ncharger.\nd) Never disconnect cables from the battery\nor from the alternator while the engine is\nrunning.\ne) The alternator is turned by an engine\ndrivebelt. Serious injury could result if\nyour hands, hair or clothes become\nentangled in the belt with the engine\nrunning.\nf) Because the alternator is connected\ndirectly to the battery, take care not to\nshort out the main terminal to earth.\ng) Wrap a plastic bag over the alternator,\nand secure it with rubber bands, before\nsteam-cleaning the engine.",
        "14 Charging system - check 3\n1 If a malfunction occurs in the charging\ncircuit, don't automatically assume that the\nalternator is causing the problem. First check\nthe following items:\na) Check the drivebelt tension and condition\n(see Chapter 1). Renew the drivebelt if it's\nworn or deteriorated.\nb) Make sure the alternator mounting and\nadjustment bolts are tight.\nc) Inspect the alternator wiring harness and\nthe connectors at the alternator and\nvoltage regulator. They must be in good\ncondition and tight.\nd) Check the fuses.\ne) Start the engine and check the alternator\nfor abnormal noises (a shrieking or\nsquealing sound indicates a worn bearing,\nbut could also be due to a slipping\ndrivebelt - see a) above).\nf) Check the specific gravity of the battery\nelectrolyte. If it's low, charge the battery\n(doesn't apply to maintenance-free\nbatteries).\ng) Make sure the battery is fully-charged\n(one bad cell in a battery can cause\novercharging by the alternator).\nh) Disconnect the battery cables (negative\nfirst, then positive). Inspect the battery\nposts and the cable clamps for corrosion.\nClean them thoroughly if necessary (see\nChapter 1).\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n2 With the ignition off, connect a 12 volt test\nlight between the battery negative post and\nthe disconnected negative cable clamp. If the\ntest light does not come on, refit the cable\nand proceed to paragraph 4. If the test light\ncomes on, there is a short (drain) in the\nelectrical system of the vehicle. The short\nmust be repaired before the charging system\ncan be checked. Note: Accessories which are\nalways on (such as the clock or the radio\nstation memory) must be disconnected before\nperforming this check.\n3 Disconnect the alternator wiring harness. If\nthe test light now goes out, the alternator is\nfaulty. If the light stays on, remove each fuse\nin turn until the light goes out (this will tell you\nwhich component is shorting out).\n4 Using a voltmeter, check the battery\nvoltage with the engine off. It should be\napproximately 12 volts.\n5 Start the engine and check the battery\nvoltage again. It should now be approximately\n14 to 15 volts.\n6 Turn on the headlights. The voltage should\ndrop, and then come back up, if the charging\nsystem is working properly.\n7 If the voltage reading is more than the\nspecified charging voltage, renew the voltage\nregulator (refer to Section 16). If the voltage is\nless, the alternator diode(s), stator or rotor\nmay be faulty, or the voltage regulator may be\nmalfunctioning.\n8 If there is no short-circuit causing battery\ndrain but the battery is constantly\ndischarging, then either the battery itself is\ndefective, the alternator drivebelt is loose (see\nChapter 1), the alternator brushes are worn,\ndirty or disconnected (see Section 17), the\nvoltage regulator is malfunctioning (see\nSection 16) or the diodes, stator coil or rotor\ncoil are defective. Repairing or renewing the\ndiodes, stator coil or rotor coil is beyond the\nscope of the home mechanic. Either renew\n12.11  The sensor tip should be set at 1.0 +-\n0.3 mm from the pulse wheel\nthe alternator complete, or take it to an\nautomotive electrician, who may be able to\noverhaul it. Note: On models up to 1986, a\nblown ignition/no-charge warning light bulb\nwill prevent the alternator from charging. After\n1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the\nwarning light, in order to allow current to\nbypass the light in the event of a broken circuit\n(blown warning light).",

Make sure the new unit\nlooks identical to the old alternator. Look at\nthe terminals - they should be the same in\nnumber, size and location as the terminals on\nthe old alternator. Finally, look at the identifi-\ncation numbers - they will be stamped into the\nhousing, or printed on a tag attached to the\nhousing. Make sure the numbers are the same\non both alternators.\n6 Many new alternators do not come with a\npulley fitted, so you may have to transfer the\npulley from the old unit to the new one.\n7 Refitting is the reverse of removal.\n8 After the alternator is fitted, adjust the\ndrivebelt tension (see Chapter 1).\n9 Check the charging voltage to verify \nproper operation of the alternator (see Sec-\ntion 14).",
        "16 Voltage regulator - renewal 1\n1 The voltage regulator controls the charging\nsystem voltage by limiting the alternator\noutput. The regulator is a sealed unit, and isn't\nadjustable.\n2 If the voltmeter indicates that the alternator\nis not charging (or if the ignition/no-charge\nwarning light comes on) and the alternator,\nbattery, drivebelt tension and electrical\nconnections seem to be fine, have the\nregulator checked by a dealer service\ndepartment or electrical specialist.\n3 Disconnect the battery negative cable.\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery.

        "18 Starting system - general\ninformation and precautions\nThe sole function of the starting system is\nto turn over the engine quickly enough to\nallow it to start.\nThe starting system consists of the battery,\nthe starter motor, the starter solenoid, the\nignition switch, and the wires connecting\nthem. The solenoid is mounted directly on the\nstarter motor. The starter/solenoid motor\nassembly is fitted on the lower part of the\nengine, next to the transmission bellhousing.\nWhen the ignition key is turned to the Start\nposition, the starter solenoid is actuated\nthrough the starter control circuit. The starter\nsolenoid then connects the battery to the\nstarter, and moves the starter pinion into\nmesh with the flywheel ring gear. The battery\nsupplies the electrical energy to the starter\nmotor, which does the actual work of cranking\nthe engine.\nThe starter motor on some manual\ntransmission vehicles can only be operated\nwhen the clutch pedal is depressed.

        "19 Starter motor - \nin-vehicle check 2\nNote: Before diagnosing starter problems,\nmake sure the battery is fully charged.\n1 If the starter motor does not turn at all when\nthe switch is operated, make sure that the\ngear lever is in Neutral or Park (automatic\ntransmission) or, where applicable, that the\nclutch pedal is depressed (manual\ntransmission).\n2 Make sure that the battery is charged, and\nthat all cables, both at the battery and starter\nsolenoid terminals, are clean and secure.\n3 If the starter motor spins but the engine is\nnot cranking, the overrun clutch in the starter\nmotor is slipping, and the starter motor must\nbe renewed.\n4 If, when the switch is actuated, the starter\nmotor does not operate at all but the solenoid\nclicks, then the problem lies either in the\nbattery, the main solenoid contacts, or the\nstarter motor itself (or the engine is seized).\n5 If the solenoid plunger cannot be heard\nwhen the switch is actuated, the battery is\nfaulty, the switch is defective, the fusible link\nis burned-out (the circuit is open), or the\nsolenoid itself is defective.\n6 To check the solenoid, connect a jumper\nlead between the battery (+) and the ignition\nswitch wire terminal (the small terminal) on the\nsolenoid. If the starter motor now operates,\nthe solenoid is OK and the problem is in the\nignition switch, starter inhibitor switch\n(automatic transmission models), clutch\nswitch (some manual transmission models), or\nthe wiring.\n7 If the starter motor still does not operate,\nremove the starter/solenoid assembly for\ndismantling, testing and repair.\n8 If the starter motor cranks the engine at an\nabnormally-slow speed, first make sure that\nthe battery is charged, and that all terminal\nconnections are tight. If the engine is partially-\nseized, or has the wrong viscosity oil in it, it\nwill crank slowly.\n9 Run the engine until normal operating\ntemperature is reached, then disconnect the\ncoil HT lead from the distributor cap and earth\nit on the engine.\n10 Connect a voltmeter positive lead to the\nbattery positive post, and connect the\nnegative lead to the negative post.\n11 Crank the engine, and take the voltmeter\nreadings as soon as a steady figure is\nindicated. Do not allow the starter motor to\nturn for more than 10 seconds at a time. A\nreading of 9 volts or more, with the starter\nmotor turning at normal cranking speed, is\nnormal. If the reading is 9 volts or more but\nthe cranking speed is slow, the solenoid\ncontacts are burned, there is a bad\nconnection, or the starter motor itself is faulty.\nIf the reading is less than 9 volts and the\ncranking speed is slow, the starter motor is\nfaulty or the battery is responsible (defective\nor discharged).",

    "input": "5 Ignition system - general\nThe ignition system includes the ignition\nswitch, the battery, the distributor, the primary\n(low-voltage/low-tension or LT) and\nsecondary (high-voltage/high-tension or HT)\nwiring circuits, the spark plugs and the spark\nplug leads. Models fitted with a carburettor or\nL-Jetronic fuel injection are equipped with a\nTransistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system.\nModels fitted with the Motronic fuel injection\nsystem have the ignition system incorporated\nwithin the Motronic system (Digital Motor\nElectronics or DME).\nTransistorised Coil Ignition (TCI)\nsystem\nThis system is has four major components;\nthe impulse generator, the ignition control\nunit, the coil, and the spark plugs. The\nimpulse generator provides a timing signal for\nthe ignition system. Equivalent to cam-\nactuated breaker points in a standard\ndistributor, the impulse generator creates an\nA/C voltage signal every time the trigger\nwheel tabs pass the impulse generator tabs.\nWhen the ignition control unit (capacitive\ndischarge unit) receives the voltage signal, it\ntriggers a spark discharge from the coil by\ninterrupting the primary coil circuit. The\nignition dwell (coil charging time) is adjusted\nby the ignition control unit for the most\nintense spark. Note: The air gap (distance\nbetween the impulse generator and trigger\nwheel tabs) can be adjusted (see Section 11).\nIgnition timing is mechanically adjusted\n(see Section 7). A centrifugal advance unit\nthat consists of spring-loaded rotating\nweights advances ignition timing as engine\nspeed increases. The vacuum advance\nadjusts ignition timing to compensate for\nchanges in engine load.\nMotronic ignition system\nThis system, also known as Digital Motor\nElectronics (DME), incorporates all ignition\nand fuel injection functions into one central\ncontrol unit or ECU (computer). The ignition\ntiming is based on inputs the ECU receives for\nengine load, engine speed, coolant\ntemperature and intake air temperature. The\nonly function the distributor performs is the\ndistribution of the high voltage signal to the\nindividual spark plugs. The distributor is\nattached directly to the cylinder head. There is\nno mechanical spark advance system used on\nthese systems.\nIgnition timing is electronically-controlled,\nand is not adjustable on Motronic systems.\nDuring starting, a crankshaft position sensor\n(reference sensor) relays the crankshaft\nposition to the ECU, and an initial baseline\nignition point is determined. Once the engine\nis running, the ignition timing is continually\nchanging, based on the various input signals\nto the ECU. Engine speed is signalled by a\nspeed sensor. Early Motronic systems have\nthe position reference sensor and the speed\nsensor mounted on the bellhousing over the\nflywheel on the left-hand side. Later Motronic\nsystems have a single sensor (pulse sensor)\nmounted over the crankshaft pulley. This\nsensor functions as a speed sensor as well as\na position reference sensor. Refer to Sec-\ntion 12 for checking and renewing the ignition\nsensors. Note: Some models are equipped\nwith a TDC sensor mounted on the front of the\nengine. This sensor is strictly for the BMW\nservice test unit, and it is not part of the\nMotronic ignition system.\nPrecautions\nCertain precautions must be observed\nwhen working on a transistorised ignition\nsystem.\na) Do not disconnect the battery cables\nwhen the engine is running\nb) Make sure the ignition control unit (TCI\nignition system) is always well earthed\n(see Section 10).\nc) Keep water away from the distributor and\nHT leads.\nd) If a tachometer is to be connected to the\nengine, always connect the tachometer\npositive (+) lead to the ignition coil\nnegative terminal (-) and never to the\ndistributor.\ne) Do not allow the coil terminals to be\nearthed, as the impulse generator or coil\ncould be damaged.\nf) Do not leave the ignition switch on for\nmore than ten minutes with the engine\noff, or if the engine will not start. \n6 Ignition system - check 2\nWarning: Because of the high\nvoltage generated by the ignition\nsystem, extreme care should be\ntaken whenever an operation is\nperformed involving ignition components.\nThis not only includes the impulse\ngenerator (electronic ignition), coil,\ndistributor and spark plug HT leads, but\nrelated components such as spark plug\nconnectors, tachometer and other test\nequipment.\n1 If the engine turns over but will not start,\ndisconnect the spark plug HT lead from any\nspark plug, and attach it to a calibrated spark\ntester (available at most car accessory \nshops). \nNote: There are two different types of spark\ntesters. Be sure to specify electronic\n(breakerless) ignition. Connect the clip on the\ntester to an earth point such as a metal\nbracket (see illustration).\n2 If you are unable to obtain a calibrated\nspark tester, remove the spark plug HT lead\nfrom one of the spark plugs. Using an\ninsulated tool, hold the lead about a quarter-\ninch from the engine block - make sure the\ngap is not more than a quarter-inch, or\ndamage may be caused to the electronic\ncomponents.\n3 Crank the engine, and observe the tip of the\ntester or spark plug HT lead to see if a spark\noccurs. If bright-blue, well-defined sparks\noccur, sufficient voltage is reaching the plugs\nto fire the engine. However, the plugs\nthemselves may be fouled, so remove and\ncheck them as described in Chapter 1.\n4 If there's no spark, check another HT lead\nin the same manner. A few sparks followed by\nno spark is the same condition as no spark at\nall.\n5 If no spark occurs, remove the distributor\ncap, and check the cap and rotor as\ndescribed in Chapter 1. If moisture is present,\nuse a water-dispersant aerosol (or something\nsimilar) to dry out the cap and rotor, then refit\nthe cap and repeat the spark test.\n6 If there's still no spark, disconnect the coil\nHT lead from the distributor cap, and \ntest this lead as described for the spark plug\nleads.\n7 If no spark occurs, check the primary wire\nconnections at the coil to make sure they're\nclean and tight. Make any necessary repairs,\nthen repeat the check.\n8 If sparks do occur from the coil HT lead, the\ndistributor cap, rotor, plug HT lead(s) or spark\nplug(s) may be defective. If there's still no\nspark, the coil-to-cap HT lead may be\ndefective. If a substitute lead doesn't make\nany difference, check the ignition coil (see\nSection 9). Note: Refer to Sections 10 and 11\nfor more test procedures on the distributors\nfitted with the TCI ignition system.\nEngine electrical systems  5*3\n6.1  To use a spark tester, simply\ndisconnect a spark plug HT lead, clip the\ntester to a convenient earth (like a valve\ncover bolt or nut) and operate the starter -\nif there is enough power to fire the plug,\nsparks will be visible between the\nelectrode tip and the tester body\n\n\n7 Ignition timing (TCI system) -\ncheck and adjustment 4\nWarning: Keep hands, equipment\nand wires well clear of the\nviscous cooling fan during\nadjustment of the ignition timing.\nNote: This Section describes the procedure\nfor checking and adjusting the ignition timing\non engines fitted with the TCI system. On\nengines fitted with the Motronic engine\nmanagement system, the ignition timing is\ncontrolled by the electronic control unit, and\nno adjustment is possible. The timing can be\nchecked using the following procedure, but no\nignition timing values were available at the\ntime of writing. If the timing is thought to be\nincorrect, refer to a BMW dealer.\n1 Some special tools are required for this\nprocedure (see illustration). The engine must\nbe at normal operating temperature, and the\nair conditioning (where fitted) must be\nswitched off. Make sure the idle speed is\ncorrect.\n2 Apply the handbrake, and chock the wheels\nto prevent movement of the vehicle. The\ntransmission must be in neutral (manual) or\nPark (automatic).\n3 The timing marks are located on the engine\nflywheel (viewed through the timing check\nhole in the bellhousing) and/or on the vibration\ndamper on the front of the engine.\n4 Where applicable, disconnect the vacuum\nhose from the distributor vacuum advance\nunit.\n5 Connect a tachometer and timing light\naccording to the equipment manufacturer's\ninstructions (an inductive pick-up timing light\nis preferred). Generally, the power leads for\nthe timing light are attached to the battery\nterminals, and the pick-up lead is attached to\nthe No 1 spark plug HT lead. The No 1 spark\nplug is the one at the front of the engine.\nCaution: If an inductive pick-up\ntiming light isn't available, don't\npuncture the spark plug HT lead\nto attach the timing light pick-up\nlead. Instead, use an adapter between the\nspark plug and HT lead. If the insulation on\nthe HT lead is damaged, the secondary\nvoltage will jump to earth at the damaged\npoint, and the engine will misfire.\nNote: On some models, a TDC transmitter is\nfitted for checking the ignition system.\nHowever, a special BMW tester must be\nconnected to the diagnostic socket to use it,\nso unless the special tester is available, a\nconventional timing light should be used. The\nignition timing mark may be on the vibration\ndamper, but if not, normally the TDC mark will\nbe. If the timing light is of the adjustable delay\ntype, then the ignition timing may be\ndetermined by zeroing the adjustment, then\nturning the adjustment until the TDC marks are\naligned, and then reading off the amount of\nadvance from the timing light. If a standard\ntiming light is being used, make a mark on the\nvibration damper in accordance with the\nspecified advance, using the following formula\nto calculate the distance from the TDC mark\nto the timing mark:\nDistance = 2Pr x advance\n360\nwhere P = 3.142\nr = radius of vibration damper\nadvance = specified advance \nBTDC in degrees\n6 With the ignition off, loosen the distributor\nclamp nut just enough to allow the distributor\nto pivot without any slipping.\n7 Make sure the timing light wires are routed\naway from the drivebelts and fan, then start\nthe engine.\n8 Raise the engine rpm to the specified\nspeed, and then point the flashing timing light\nat the timing marks - be very careful of moving\nengine components.\n9 The mark on the flywheel or vibration\ndamper will appear stationary. If it's aligned\nwith the specified point on the bellhousing or\nengine front cover, the ignition timing is\ncorrect (see illustrations).\n10 If the marks aren't aligned, adjustment is\nrequired. Turn the distributor very slowly until\nthe marks are aligned, taking care not to\ntouch the HT leads.\n11 Tighten the nut on the distributor clamp,\nand recheck the timing.\n12 Switch off the engine, and remove the\ntiming light and tachometer. Reconnect the\nvacuum hose where applicable.\n8 Distributor - \nremoval and refitting 4\nTCI system\nRemoval\n1 After carefully marking them for position,\nremove the coil HT lead and spark plug HT\nleads from the distributor cap (see Chapter 1).\n2 Remove No 1 spark plug (the one nearest\nyou when you are standing in front of the\nengine).\n3 Manually rotate the engine to Top Dead\nCentre (TDC) on the compression stroke for\nNo 1 piston (see Chapter 2A)\n4 Carefully mark the vacuum hoses, if more\nthan one is present on your distributor.\n5 Disconnect the vacuum hose(s).\n6 Disconnect the primary circuit wires from\nthe distributor.\n7 Mark the relationship of the rotor tip to the\ndistributor housing (see illustration).

Note that the measured\nresistance will vary according to the\ntemperature of the coil, so don't rush to\ncondemn the coil if the resistance is only a\nlittle way out.\n7 It is essential for proper ignition system\noperation that all coil terminals and wire leads\nbe kept clean and dry.\n8 Refit the coil in its mounting, and reconnect\nthe wiring. Refitting is the reverse of removal.\n10 Impulse generator and\nignition control unit - check\nand renewal (TCI system)\n3\n1 The impulse generator (located in the\ndistributor) and ignition control unit need to be\ntested in the event there is no spark at the\nspark plugs. Make sure the plug leads,\nignition coil and spark plugs are working\nproperly (see Sections 6 and 9). There are two\ntypes of control units; Bosch or\nSiemens/Telefunken. The two types (see\nillustration) can be distinguished by their\nelectrical connectors. The Bosch type uses a\nsingle, large rectangular connector at the\nbottom of the unit, while the\nSiemens/Telefunken control unit uses two\nround electrical connectors at the front of the\nunit.\nCheck\nVoltage supply and earth to ignition\ncontrol unit\n2 With the ignition off, remove the harness\nconnectors from the ignition control unit (see\nillustrations). Connect a voltmeter between\nconnector terminals 2 and 4 on Bosch\nsystems, or between terminals 6 and 3 on\nSiemens/Telefunken systems.\n3 Turn the ignition on. There should be\nbattery voltage on the designated terminals. If\nthere is no voltage, check the wiring harness\nfor an open-circuit (see Chapter 12).\n4 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity\nbetween connector terminal 2 (Bosch) or 6\n(Siemens/Telefunken) and the earth to the\nvehicle body. Continuity should exist.\n5 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity\nbetween connector terminal 4 (Bosch) or 3\n(Siemens/Telefunken) and terminal 15 of the\nignition coil. Continuity should exist.\n6 If the readings are incorrect, repair the\nwiring harness.\nImpulse generator signal\n7 If the ignition control unit is receiving\nbattery voltage, check the A/C signal voltage\ncoming from the impulse generator to the\ncontrol unit.\n5*6 Engine electrical systems\n10.2b  Check for voltage at terminals 6 and\n3 on the control unit electrical connector\n(Siemens/Telefunken system shown)\n10.2a  Check for voltage at terminals 2 and\n4 on the control unit electrical connector\n(Bosch system shown)\n1  Coil HT lead\n2  Ignition coil\n3  Spark plug HT lead\n4  Spark plug\n5  Ignition control unit (Bosch)\n6  Ignition control unit \n(Siemens/Telefunken)\n7  Wiring harness\n8  Distributor housing with \ncentrifugal advance \ncounterweights\n9  Vacuum diaphragm\n10  Circlip\n11  Impulse generator\n12  Trigger wheel\n13  Circlip\n14  Dust shield\n15  Ignition rotor\n16  Distributor\n17  Roll pin\n18  Trigger wheel and impulse \ngenerator tabs\n19  Cap retaining clip\n20  Impulse generator \n10.1  Schematic of the ignition components used on engines with the TCI system\n\n\n8 Use a digital voltmeter for the following\na) On Bosch systems, connect the positive\nprobe to connector terminal 5, and the\nnegative probe to terminal 6 (see\nb) On Siemens/Telefunken systems, connect\nthe positive probe to terminal (+) of the\nsmaller connector, and the negative\nprobe to terminal (-).\n9 Have an assistant crank the engine over,\nand check that there is 1 to 2 volts A/C\npresent. If there is no voltage, check the\nwiring harness between the impulse generator\n(in the distributor) and the control unit. If the\nharness is OK, check the impulse generator\nresistance.\nWarning: Do not crank the\nengine over for an excessive\nlength of time. If necessary,\ndisconnect the cold start injector\nelectrical connector (see Chapter 4) to\nstop the flow of fuel into the engine.\n10 To check the resistance in the impulse\ngenerator, proceed as described for your\nsystem below:\na) On Bosch units, measure the resistance\nbetween connector terminals 5 and 6\n(see illustration 10.8). The reading\nshould be 1000 to 1200 ohms.\nb) On Siemens/Telefunken units, measure\nthe resistance between the terminals of\nthe smaller connector. The reading should\nbe 1000 to 1200 ohms.\n11 If the resistance readings are incorrect,\nrenew the impulse generator. If the resistance\nreadings for the impulse generator are correct\nand the control unit voltages (supply voltage\n[paragraphs 1 to 6] and signal voltage\n[paragraphs 7 to 9]) are incorrect, renew the\ncontrol unit.\nRenewal\nIgnition control unit\n12 Make sure the ignition is switched off.\n13 Disconnect the electrical connector(s)\nfrom the control unit.\n14 Remove the mounting screws from the\ncontrol unit, and lift it from the engine\ncompartment.\n15 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:\nOn Bosch control units, a special dielectric\ngrease is used between the heat sink and the\nback of the control unit. In the event the two\nare separated (renewal or testing) the old\ngrease must be removed, and the heat sink\ncleaned off using 180-grit sandpaper. Apply\nCuril K2 (Bosch part number 81 22 9 243). A\nsilicon dielectric compound can be used as a\nsubstitute. This treatment is very important for\nthe long life of these expensive ignition parts.\nImpulse generator\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n16 Disconnect the battery negative cable.\n17 Remove the distributor from the engine\n(see Section 8).\n18 Using a pair of circlip pliers, remove the\ncirclip retaining the trigger wheel (see\n19 Use two flat-bladed screwdrivers\npositioned at opposite sides of the trigger\nwheel, and carefully prise it up (see\nillustration). Note: Push the screwdrivers in\nas far as possible without bending the trigger\nwheel. Prise only on the strongest, centre\nportion of the trigger wheel. In the event the\ntrigger wheel is bent, it must be replaced with\na new one. Note: Be sure not to lose the roll\npin when lifting out the trigger wheel.\n20 Remove the mounting screws from the\nimpulse generator electrical connector, the\nvacuum diaphragm and the baseplate.\n21 Remove the two screws from the vacuum\nadvance unit, and separate it from the\ndistributor by moving the assembly down\nwhile unhooking it from the baseplate pin.\n22 Use circlip pliers to remove the circlip that\nretains the impulse generator and the\nbaseplate assembly.\n23 Carefully remove the impulse generator\nand the baseplate assembly as a single unit.\n24 Remove the three screws, and separate\nthe baseplate assembly from the impulse\ngenerator.\n25 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:\nBe sure to position the insulating ring between\nthe generator coil and the baseplate. It must\nbe centred before tightening the mounting\nscrews. Also, it will be necessary to\ncheck/adjust the air gap if the trigger wheel\nhas been removed, or tampered with to the\npoint that the clearance is incorrect (see\nSection 11).\n11 Air gap (TCI system) - \ncheck and adjustment 2\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.\n2 Insert a brass feeler gauge between the\ntrigger wheel tab and the impulse generator\n(see illustration). Slide the feeler gauge up\nEngine electrical systems  5*7\n10.19  Carefully prise the trigger wheel off\nthe distributor shaft\n10.18  Use circlip pliers and remove the\ncirclip from the distributor shaft\n10.8  Back-probe the ignition control unit\nconnector, and check for signal voltage on\nterminals 5 and 6 (Bosch system shown). It\nis very helpful to use angled probes\n11.2  Use a brass feeler gauge to check\nthe air gap (be sure the gauge rubs lightly\nagainst the trigger wheel as well as the\nlocating pin for the correct adjustment)\n\n\nand down - you should feel a slight drag on\nthe feeler gauge as it is moved if the gap is\ncorrect. The gap must be as given in this\nChapter's Specifications.\n3 To adjust the gap, it is necessary to remove\nthe impulse generator and the baseplate\nassembly from the distributor (see illus-\ntration 10.1).\n4 Follow paragraphs 17 to 24 in Section 10\nand loosen the screws that retain the impulse\ngenerator to the baseplate assembly.\n5 Carefully insert the feeler gauge and tighten\nthe screws.\n6 Refit the assembly back into the distributor\nand recheck the adjustment.\n12 Ignition sensors (Motronic\nsystem) - check and renewal 2\nNote: Some models are equipped with a TDC\nsensor mounted on the front of the engine.\nThis sensor is strictly for the BMW service test\nunit, and is not part of the Motronic ignition\nsystem.\nSpeed and position sensors\nCheck\n1 Locate the two electrical connectors for the\nsensors (see illustrations). The grey\nconnector is for the position sensor, and the\nwhite connector is for the speed sensor.\n2 Using an ohmmeter, check the resistance\nbetween terminal 1 (yellow wire) and terminal\n2 (black wire) on the sensor side of each\nconnector. The resistance should be 860 to\n1,060 ohms.\n3 Also check the resistance between terminal\n3 and either terminal 1 or terminal 2. The\nresistance should be approximately 100 000\nohms.\n4 If the reading(s) are incorrect, renew the\nsensor(s).\nRenewal\n5 Remove the sensor mounting screw(s),\nusing an Allen key where necessary, and pull\nthe sensor(s) from the sockets. Disconnect\nthe wiring from one sensor at a time - be sure\nthe connectors are not interchanged when\nfitting new sensors. The bellhousing is marked\nwith a B for the position sensor (grey\nconnector) and D for the speed sensor (black\nconnector) (see illustration). Note: It is a\ngood idea to check the condition of the raised\npin on the flywheel while the sensors are out\nof the sockets. Turn the engine by hand as\nnecessary to bring the pin into view.\n6 Tighten the sensor mounting screw(s)\nsecurely, but be careful not to overtighten.\nPulse sensor (later models)\nCheck\n7 Locate the two electrical connectors for the\nsensor (see illustrations). Disconnect the\nelectrical connector from the front. \n8 Using an ohmmeter, check resistance\nbetween terminal 1 (yellow wire) and terminal\n2 (black wire) on the sensor side of each\nconnector (see illustration). The resistance\nshould be 500 to 600 ohms.\n9 If the reading is incorrect, renew the sensor.\nRenewal\n10 Remove the pulse sensor mounting bolt\nusing a 5 mm hex spanner (see illustration).\n5*8 Engine electrical systems\n12.10  The pulse sensor itself (arrowed) is\nlocated on the timing belt cover, to one\nside of the pulley (later models)\n12.8  The resistance of the pulse sensor\nshould be 500 to 600 ohms (later models)\n12.7b  On later 5-Series models, the pulse\nsensor connector (arrowed) is located next\nto the valve cover\n12.7a  On later 3-Series models, the pulse\nsensor connector (arrowed) is located next\nto the 20-pin diagnostic connector\n12.5  Location of the position sensor (B) and\nspeed sensor (D) on the bellhousing on all\nMotronic systems - do not interchange the\nsensors, or the engine will not start\n12.1b  Location of the position sensor\n(grey connector) (A) and the speed sensor\n(black connector) (B) on Motronic systems\n(later models)\n12.1a  Location of the position sensor (grey\nconnector) (A) and the speed sensor (black\nconnector) (B) on Motronic systems (early\n\n\nWithdraw the sensor from its bracket and\n11 When fitting the new sensor, use a brass\nfeeler gauge to position the tip of the sensor\nthe correct distance from the pulse wheel\n12 Tighten the mounting bolt, but be careful\nnot to overtighten it.\n13 Charging system - general\ninformation and precautions\nThere are two different types of alternator\nfitted on these models; Bosch and Motorola.\nAlso, there are three different amperage\nratings available; 65A, 80A or 90A. A stamped\nserial number on the rear of the alternator will\nidentify the type and amperage rating.\nPerform the charging system checks (see\nSection 14) to diagnose any problems with the\nalternator.\nThe voltage regulator and the alternator\nbrushes are mounted as a single assembly.\nOn Bosch alternators, this unit can be\nremoved from the alternator (see Section 16)\nand the components serviced individually.\nThe alternator on all models is mounted on\nthe left front of the engine, and utilises a V-\nbelt and pulley drive system. Drivebelt tension\nand battery servicing are the two primary\nmaintenance requirements for these systems.\nSee Chapter 1 for the procedures regarding\nengine drivebelt checking and battery\nservicing.\nThe ignition/no-charge warning light should\ncome on when the ignition key is turned to\nStart, then go off immediately the engine\nstarts. If it remains on, there is a malfunction\nin the charging system (see Section 14). Some\nvehicles are also equipped with a voltmeter. If\nthe voltmeter indicates abnormally high or low\nvoltage, check the charging system (see\nSection 14). Note: On models up to 1986, a\nblown ignition/no-charge warning light will\nprevent the alternator from charging. After\n1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the\nwarning light in order to allow current to\nbypass the light in the event of a broken circuit\n(blown warning light).\nPrecautions\nBe very careful when making electrical\ncircuit connections to the alternator, and note\nthe following:\na) When reconnecting wires to the alternator\nfrom the battery, be sure to note the\npolarity.\nb) Before using arc-welding equipment to\nrepair any part of the vehicle, disconnect\nthe wires from the battery terminals and\nfrom the alternator.\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\nc) Never start the engine with a battery\ncharger connected. Always disconnect\nboth battery cables before using a battery\ncharger.\nd) Never disconnect cables from the battery\nor from the alternator while the engine is\nrunning.\ne) The alternator is turned by an engine\ndrivebelt. Serious injury could result if\nyour hands, hair or clothes become\nentangled in the belt with the engine\nrunning.\nf) Because the alternator is connected\ndirectly to the battery, take care not to\nshort out the main terminal to earth.\ng) Wrap a plastic bag over the alternator,\nand secure it with rubber bands, before\nsteam-cleaning the engine.\n14 Charging system - check 3\n1 If a malfunction occurs in the charging\ncircuit, don't automatically assume that the\nalternator is causing the problem. First check\nthe following items:\na) Check the drivebelt tension and condition\n(see Chapter 1). Renew the drivebelt if it's\nworn or deteriorated.\nb) Make sure the alternator mounting and\nadjustment bolts are tight.\nc) Inspect the alternator wiring harness and\nthe connectors at the alternator and\nvoltage regulator. They must be in good\ncondition and tight.\nd) Check the fuses.\ne) Start the engine and check the alternator\nfor abnormal noises (a shrieking or\nsquealing sound indicates a worn bearing,\nbut could also be due to a slipping\ndrivebelt - see a) above).\nf) Check the specific gravity of the battery\nelectrolyte. If it's low, charge the battery\n(doesn't apply to maintenance-free\nbatteries).\ng) Make sure the battery is fully-charged\n(one bad cell in a battery can cause\novercharging by the alternator).\nh) Disconnect the battery cables (negative\nfirst, then positive). Inspect the battery\nposts and the cable clamps for corrosion.\nClean them thoroughly if necessary (see\nChapter 1).\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n2 With the ignition off, connect a 12 volt test\nlight between the battery negative post and\nthe disconnected negative cable clamp. If the\ntest light does not come on, refit the cable\nand proceed to paragraph 4. If the test light\ncomes on, there is a short (drain) in the\nelectrical system of the vehicle. The short\nmust be repaired before the charging system\ncan be checked. Note: Accessories which are\nalways on (such as the clock or the radio\nstation memory) must be disconnected before\nperforming this check.\n3 Disconnect the alternator wiring harness. If\nthe test light now goes out, the alternator is\nfaulty. If the light stays on, remove each fuse\nin turn until the light goes out (this will tell you\nwhich component is shorting out).\n4 Using a voltmeter, check the battery\nvoltage with the engine off. It should be\napproximately 12 volts.\n5 Start the engine and check the battery\nvoltage again. It should now be approximately\n14 to 15 volts.\n6 Turn on the headlights. The voltage should\ndrop, and then come back up, if the charging\nsystem is working properly.\n7 If the voltage reading is more than the\nspecified charging voltage, renew the voltage\nregulator (refer to Section 16). If the voltage is\nless, the alternator diode(s), stator or rotor\nmay be faulty, or the voltage regulator may be\nmalfunctioning.\n8 If there is no short-circuit causing battery\ndrain but the battery is constantly\ndischarging, then either the battery itself is\ndefective, the alternator drivebelt is loose (see\nChapter 1), the alternator brushes are worn,\ndirty or disconnected (see Section 17), the\nvoltage regulator is malfunctioning (see\nSection 16) or the diodes, stator coil or rotor\ncoil are defective. Repairing or renewing the\ndiodes, stator coil or rotor coil is beyond the\nscope of the home mechanic. Either renew\n12.11  The sensor tip should be set at 1.0 +-\n0.3 mm from the pulse wheel\n\n\nthe alternator complete, or take it to an\nautomotive electrician, who may be able to\noverhaul it. Note: On models up to 1986, a\nblown ignition/no-charge warning light bulb\nwill prevent the alternator from charging. After\n1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the\nwarning light, in order to allow current to\nbypass the light in the event of a broken circuit\n(blown warning light).\n15 Alternator - \nremoval and refitting 1\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\nRemoval\n1 Detach the battery negative cable.\n2 Detach the electrical connectors from the\nalternator, noting their locations for refitting\n(see illustration). Note: On some models, it\nmay be necessary to remove the air cleaner\nassembly and airflow meter to gain access to\nthe alternator.\n3 Loosen the alternator adjustment and pivot\nbolts, and slip off the drivebelt (see Chap-\nter 1).\n4 Remove the adjustment and pivot bolts,\nand separate the alternator from the engine.\nRefitting\n5 If you are renewing the alternator, take the\nold one with you when purchasing a new or\nreconditioned unit. Make sure the new unit\nlooks identical to the old alternator. Look at\nthe terminals - they should be the same in\nnumber, size and location as the terminals on\nthe old alternator. Finally, look at the identifi-\ncation numbers - they will be stamped into the\nhousing, or printed on a tag attached to the\nhousing. Make sure the numbers are the same\non both alternators.\n6 Many new alternators do not come with a\npulley fitted, so you may have to transfer the\npulley from the old unit to the new one.\n7 Refitting is the reverse of removal.\n8 After the alternator is fitted, adjust the\ndrivebelt tension (see Chapter 1).\n9 Check the charging voltage to verify \nproper operation of the alternator (see Sec-\ntion 14).\n16 Voltage regulator - renewal 1\n1 The voltage regulator controls the charging\nsystem voltage by limiting the alternator\noutput. The regulator is a sealed unit, and isn't\nadjustable.\n2 If the voltmeter indicates that the alternator\nis not charging (or if the ignition/no-charge\nwarning light comes on) and the alternator,\nbattery, drivebelt tension and electrical\nconnections seem to be fine, have the\nregulator checked by a dealer service\ndepartment or electrical specialist.\n3 Disconnect the battery negative cable.\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\nBosch alternator\n4 The voltage regulator is mounted externally\non the alternator housing. To renew the\nregulator, remove the mounting screws (see\nillustration) and lift it off the alternator (see\nillustration). Note: Some Bosch alternators\nhave an integral voltage regulator which is part\nof the brush assembly.\n5 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:\nBefore refitting the regulator, check the\ncondition of the slip rings (see illustration).\nUse a torch and check for any scoring or deep\nwear grooves. Renew the alternator if\nnecessary.\nMotorola alternator\n6 Remove the alternator from the engine\ncompartment (see Section 15).\n7 Remove the rear cover and diode carrier,\nremove the voltage regulator mounting\nscrews (see illustration) and lift the regulator\noff the alternator body.\n8 Refitting is the reverse of removal.\n17 Alternator brushes - \ncheck and renewal 3\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery.\n5*10 Engine electrical systems\n16.5  Use a torch to check the slip rings for\nscoring or deep grooves\n16.4b  The regulator can be withdrawn\neasily on Bosch alternators. This type of\nregulator is integral with the brush\nassembly\n16.4a  Remove the nuts and lift off the\nsmall terminal protector from the\nalternator cover, then remove the nuts and\nthe cover\n15.2  Depending on how many accessories\nthe vehicle has, sometimes it's easier to\nremove the alternator from the brackets\nfirst, and then turn it sideways to gain\naccess to the connections (arrowed) on\nthe rear of the alternator body\n\n\nRefer to the information on page 0-7 at the\nfront of this manual before detaching the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.\nBosch alternator\n2 Remove the voltage regulator from the back\nof the alternator (see Section 16).\n3 Measure the length of the brushes (see\nillustration). They should not be less than \n6.0 mm. If any are worn past this point, renew\nthem all as a set. \n4 Also check for excessively worn slip rings\n(see illustration 16.5).\n5 The brushes are retained either by set\nscrews or by solder. If you are not skilled at\nsoldering, it may be best to have an auto\nelectrician fit the new brushes. Note: Be\ncareful not to apply heat to the solder joint for\nmore than 5 seconds. If necessary, use a heat\nsink to capture the excess heat. This can be\naccomplished by clamping a pair of needle-\nnose pliers next to the solder joint.\n6 On the screw type, hold the assembly in\nplace and refit the screws. Tighten them\nevenly, a little at a time, so the holder isn't\ndistorted.\n7 Refit the regulator assembly to the\nalternator.\n8 Reconnect the battery negative cable.\nMotorola alternator\n9 Remove the alternator.\n10 The brushes are mounted under the\nregulator on the rear of the alternator (see\nillustration 16.7).\n11 Remove the mounting screws and\ninsulating washers, and separate the voltage\nregulator and brush holder from the brush end\nhousing.\n12 Measure the length of the brushes (see\nillustration 17.3). If any brush is less then \n6.0 mm long, renew them all as a set.\n13 Make sure the brushes move smoothly in\nthe holder.\n14 Refit the brush holder/regulator. Tighten\nthe screws securely. Make sure the brushes\naren't earthed.\n15 Refitting is the reverse of removal.\n18 Starting system - general\ninformation and precautions\nThe sole function of the starting system is\nto turn over the engine quickly enough to\nallow it to start.\nThe starting system consists of the battery,\nthe starter motor, the starter solenoid, the\nignition switch, and the wires connecting\nthem. The solenoid is mounted directly on the\nstarter motor. The starter/solenoid motor\nassembly is fitted on the lower part of the\nengine, next to the transmission bellhousing.\nWhen the ignition key is turned to the Start\nposition, the starter solenoid is actuated\nthrough the starter control circuit. The starter\nsolenoid then connects the battery to the\nstarter, and moves the starter pinion into\nmesh with the flywheel ring gear. The battery\nsupplies the electrical energy to the starter\nmotor, which does the actual work of cranking\nthe engine.\nThe starter motor on some manual\ntransmission vehicles can only be operated\nwhen the clutch pedal is depressed. On a\nvehicle equipped with automatic\ntransmission, the starter can only be operated\nEngine electrical systems  5*11\n17.3  Check the brush length in the normal\nrest position (spring uncoiled)\n16.7  Exploded view of the Motorola alternator\n\n\nwhen the transmission selector lever is in Park\nor Neutral.\nAlways detach the battery negative cable\nbefore working on the starting system.\n19 Starter motor - \nin-vehicle check 2\nNote: Before diagnosing starter problems,\nmake sure the battery is fully charged.\n1 If the starter motor does not turn at all when\nthe switch is operated, make sure that the\ngear lever is in Neutral or Park (automatic\ntransmission) or, where applicable, that the\nclutch pedal is depressed (manual\ntransmission).\n2 Make sure that the battery is charged, and\nthat all cables, both at the battery and starter\nsolenoid terminals, are clean and secure.\n3 If the starter motor spins but the engine is\nnot cranking, the overrun clutch in the starter\nmotor is slipping, and the starter motor must\nbe renewed.\n4 If, when the switch is actuated, the starter\nmotor does not operate at all but the solenoid\nclicks, then the problem lies either in the\nbattery, the main solenoid contacts, or the\nstarter motor itself (or the engine is seized).\n5 If the solenoid plunger cannot be heard\nwhen the switch is actuated, the battery is\nfaulty, the switch is defective, the fusible link\nis burned-out (the circuit is open), or the\nsolenoid itself is defective.\n6 To check the solenoid, connect a jumper\nlead between the battery (+) and the ignition\nswitch wire terminal (the small terminal) on the\nsolenoid. If the starter motor now operates,\nthe solenoid is OK and the problem is in the\nignition switch, starter inhibitor switch\n(automatic transmission models), clutch\nswitch (some manual transmission models), or\nthe wiring.\n7 If the starter motor still does not operate,\nremove the starter/solenoid assembly for\ndismantling, testing and repair.\n8 If the starter motor cranks the engine at an\nabnormally-slow speed, first make sure that\nthe battery is charged, and that all terminal\nconnections are tight. If the engine is partially-\nseized, or has the wrong viscosity oil in it, it\nwill crank slowly.\n9 Run the engine until normal operating\ntemperature is reached, then disconnect the\ncoil HT lead from the distributor cap and earth\nit on the engine.\n10 Connect a voltmeter positive lead to the\nbattery positive post, and connect the\nnegative lead to the negative post.\n11 Crank the engine, and take the voltmeter\nreadings as soon as a steady figure is\nindicated. Do not allow the starter motor to\nturn for more than 10 seconds at a time. A\nreading of 9 volts or more, with the starter\nmotor turning at normal cranking speed, is\nnormal. If the reading is 9 volts or more but\nthe cranking speed is slow, the solenoid\ncontacts are burned, there is a bad\nconnection, or the starter motor itself is faulty.\nIf the reading is less than 9 volts and the\ncranking speed is slow, the starter motor is\nfaulty or the battery is responsible (defective\nor discharged).\n20 Starter motor - \nremoval and refitting 1\nNote: If the starter motor is defective, it should\nbe renewed, or taken to an auto electrical\nspecialist for repair. Overhaul of the starter\nmotor is unlikely to be a practical proposition\nfor the home mechanic, even if spare parts are\navailable. However, the solenoid can be\nrenewed separately (see Section 21).\nRemoval\nCaution: If the radio in your\nvehicle is equipped with an anti-\ntheft system, make sure you\nhave the correct activation code\nbefore disconnecting the battery. Refer to\nthe information on page 0-7 at the front of\nthis manual before detaching the cable.\nNote: If, after connecting the battery, the\nwrong language appears on the instrument\npanel display, refer to page 0-7 for the\nlanguage resetting procedure.\n1 Detach the battery negative cable.\n2 Raise the vehicle and support it securely on\naxle stands.\n3 Clearly label the wires from the terminals on\nthe starter motor and solenoid, then\ndisconnect them. Note: On some models, it\nmay be necessary to remove the air cleaner\n(see Chapter 4), coolant expansion tank (see\nChapter 3) and the heater hoses to gain\naccess to the top of the starter. Carefully label\nany hoses or components that need to be\nremoved from the engine compartment, to\navoid confusion when reassembling.\n4 Unscrew the mounting bolts and detach the\nstarter (see illustrations).",
