Brown Creek Campground has twenty camping sites to choose from and a few of them are right on the river. There are also camping spots near the bridge and parking area. The best site, in my humble opinion, can be found just a few hundred yards upstream once you get to the Skokomish River from the bridge parking area. You will have to pack in everything and cross the river a few times to get to this wonderful spot, but if you\\'re up for it I highly recommend it. There is a nice fire pit made of stacked river stones and some large stones right next to it for relaxing on. Nothing like sitting on rocks, in front of a roaring fire, while inspecting the treasures you found during the day. \\n\\n```\\nLand Type: Creek and ocean gravels \\n                                   \\nCounty: Grays Harbor \\n                     \\nGPS: N47 9.526\\' / W124 11.395\\' 10 ft. \\n                                    \\nBest Season: Winter \\n                   \\nLand Manager: BLM—Spokane \\n                              \\nMaterial: Agate, chalcedony, carnelian, jasper, orbicular jasper, jade, and \\n                                                                     \\npetrified wood \\n              \\nTools: Gem scoop \\n                 \\nVehicle: Any \\n            \\nAccommodations: Camping and lodging up and down the coast \\n                                                               \\nSpecial attractions: The Ocean is the attraction. \\n                                              \\nFinding the site: There are many ways to reach this site, but with all of them you \\n                                                                              \\nwill need to end up on WA-109.

That being said, I have been at this site on a very populated summer day and still managed to find a small handful of agates. | have been to Ocean Shores many times in my life, so I have a lot of memories here. | hope you will have some too. \\n\\nThe agate hunting here is very easy. Just make your way down to the shore and pick a direction to walk. Sometimes the gravel exposures will make this decision for you. Walk the rocky areas and keep your eyes peeled for shiny translucent agates. Having the sun in front of you can help illuminate the agates making them much easier to see. The agate here can be clear, grey, yellow, orange, and rarely a deep carnelian red. Be on the lookout in the gravels for multiple colors of jasper as well and possibly petrified wood. \\n\\nQuartzite (sugar agate) is very common here as well. \\n\\nThere are a few more public beach access points in the area. They tend to be sandy, but now and then you can find some good gravel and that means \\n\\n![57_image_0.png](57_image_0.png)\\n\\nagates. Do some exploring and if you can make friends with a local and maybe they can let you in on some good spots. You can find some killer deals on oceanfront houses and cabins during the off-season. I know I like to be right on the water as those gravel bars can come and go within hours. If you stay in town I recommend the Oasis Motel. They have always been good to me and I like their funky little rooms. Try to get one on the second floor, as they are the best rooms. \\n\\n# 10 Wynoochee River\\n\\n![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png)\\n\\nOur pebble pup, Stinky Dedos, helping out at the Wynoochee River.\\n</retrieved_text>\\n\\n\\n<task_instructions>\\nCreate a set of speech acts based on the notes provided.
