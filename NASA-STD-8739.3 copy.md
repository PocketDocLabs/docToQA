controlled moisture-free atmosphere. Demoisturizing may be accomplished by an oven bake at
93°C (200°F) ±5.5°C (±10°F) for a minimum of 4 hours for a printed wiring assembly (PWA) or
2 hours for a bare PWB, or by a vacuum bake at a lower temperature. The time in and out of the
oven or chamber shall be recorded.


CHAPTER 8 - PARTS MOUNTING
Parts, terminals, and conductors shall be mounted and supported as prescribed herein. Dimensions
provided in this chapter are for acceptance and/or rejection criteria only. Unusual environmental
applications require special design measures to provide necessary environmental survival
capability. Such measures shall be detailed on the appropriate engineering documentation.
Engineering documentation shall prescribe which alternative approach is selected, as well as
staking compounds and conformal coating requirements. They shall also detail any special
mounting arrangements or design requirements not fully covered herein.
1. Stress Relief. Stress relief shall be incorporated, wherever possible, into all leads and
conductors terminating in solder connections to provide freedom of movement of part leads or
conductors between points of constraint. Leads shall not be temporarily constrained against
spring-back force during solder solidification so that the joint is subject to residual stress.
Examples of stress relief are shown in figures throughout this chapter.
2. Part Positioning. Parts shall be positioned in compliance with the engineering
documentation and mounted in accordance with the requirements specified herein.
a. Parts shall be mounted so that terminations of other parts are not obscured. When
this is not possible, interim assembly inspection shall occur to verify that the obscured solder
joints meet the requirements herein.
b. Parts having conductive cases mounted over printed conductors or which are in
close proximity with other conductive materials shall be separated by insulation of suitable
thickness. Insulation shall be accomplished so that part identification markings remain visible and
legible.
3. Visibility of Markings. Where possible, parts shall be mounted in such a manner that
markings pertaining to value, part type, etc., are visible. For parts marked in such a way that some
of the marking will be hidden regardless of the orientation of the part, the following shall be the
order of precedence for which markings shall be visible:
a. Polarity.
b. Traceability code (if applicable).
c. Piece part value and type.
4. Glass Encased Parts. Glass encased parts such as diodes, thermistors, or resistors
shall be covered with transparent resilient sleeving or other approved material when epoxy
material is used for staking, conformal coating, or encapsulating or where damage from other
sources is likely. The epoxy material shall not be applied directly to glass.


CAUTION: WHEN USING HEAT SHRINKABLE SLEEVING, EXTREME CARE
SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PREVENT PART DAMAGE DUE TO EXCESSIVE
HEAT OR SHRINKAGE OF THE SLEEVING.
5. Hookup Wire. Hookup wire, solid or stranded, shall be supported by a means other
than the solder connections or conformal coating if wire length exceeds 2.54cm (1 inch).
Attachment to a surface by staking with resin is considered adequate support.
6. Lead Bending and Cutting.
a. During bending or cutting, part leads shall be supported on the body side to
minimize axial stress and avoid damage to seals or internal bonds. The distance from the bend to
the end seal shall be approximately equal at each end of the part. The minimum distance from the
part body or seal to the start of the bend in a part lead shall be 2 lead diameters for round leads
and 0.5mm (0.020 inch) for ribbon leads. The stress relief bend radius shall not be less than the
lead diameter or ribbon thickness. The direction of the bend should not cause the identification
markings on the mounted part to be obscured. Where the lead is welded (as on a tantalum
capacitor) the minimum distance is measured from the weld.
b. Part leads shall be formed so that they may be installed into the holes in the PWB
without excessive deformation that can stress the part body or end seals.
c. All leads should be tinned and formed before mounting the part.
CAUTION: WHERE POSSIBLE, PART LEADS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO STRESS
CORROSION CRACKING (E.G. KOVAR LEADS), SHALL BE PREFORMED
AND TRIMMED PRIOR TO TINNING.
d. Whether formed manually or by machine, part leads shall not be mounted if they
show evidence of nicks or deformations. Smooth impression marks (base metal not exposed)
resulting from tool holding forces shall not be cause for rejection.
e. Tempered leads (sometimes referred to as pins) shall not be bent nor formed for
mounting purposes since body seals and connections internal to the part may be damaged.
Tempered leads or leads with a diameter of 1.27mm (0.05 inch) or more shall not be cut with
diagonal cutters or other tools that impart shock to connections internal to the part.
7. Coated Parts. Parts shall be mounted so that the insulating coating meniscus applied
by the manufacturer on the leads does not enter the mounting hole or soldered connection.
8. Splices. Broken or damaged conductors, part leads, or printed wiring conductors shall
not be spliced.
9. Location. Part bodies shall not be in contact with soldered terminations.


8.2 Mounting of Terminals
1. General. Use of terminals shall generally be restricted to situations where parts are
expected to be removed and replaced, or where there are other compelling design requirements
for their use.
a. Terminals shall not be used as the interface connections in non-plated through
holes (PTH's). Swaging of terminals shall be performed in a way that does not damage the PWB.
b. After swaging or flaring, the rolled area or flange shall be free of circumferential
splits or cracks, but may have a maximum of three radial splits or cracks provided that the splits
or cracks are separated by at least 90° and do not extend beyond the coiled or flared area of the
terminal (Figure 8-1).
Figure 8-1.  Terminal Damage
2. Swage type terminals in non-PTH's, designed to have the terminal shoulder soldered to
the printed wiring conductor, shall be secured to the PWB by a roll swage (Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-2.  Roll Flange Terminal
3. PWB designs calling for soldering of the swaged end of the terminal to the printed
wiring conductor on a single-sided PWB shall have the terminal secured with a V-funnel swage
(refer to Figure 8-3).

4. Swage type terminals that are mounted in a PTH shall be secured to the PWB by a V-
funnel swage (Figure 8-3) or an elliptical funnel (Figure 8-4) swage. The elliptical
funnel swage is the preferred method for attachment. Terminals shall be swaged such
that they can be rotated under finger force.
Figure 8-4.  Elliptical Funnel Type Swage
8.3 Mounting of Parts to Terminals
1. Parallel Mounting. Parts shall be mounted parallel to, and in contact with, their
mounting surface. Slight angularity is permissible.
2. Lead Lengths. The length of leads between parts and terminals should be
approximately equal at both ends, except when special part shapes require staggering.
3. Stress Relief. Where parts are mounted between bifurcated terminals, without lead
wrap, it is not mandatory that the part leads have stress relief bends. Where parts are mounted
between other terminal types, it is mandatory to put a stress relief bend in at least one lead (Figure
8-5).

cleaning. In addition, no more than 30 minutes delay is allowed between cleaning and the final
rinsing with deionized water in a controlled rinse bath.
3. The final rinse bath shall be monitored by resistivity measurements made at established
intervals to pre-established resistivity limits and the results recorded. Intervals shall be based on
the number and size of PWA's cleaned, as well as time required to produce the lot. Refer to

1. Testing shall be performed with sufficient frequency to ensure compliance with the
requirements of paragraph 14.4.  At a minimum, this shall consist of once per shift, and
immediately prior to changing the cleaning solution.
2. It is recommended that statistical process control methods be used to control
continuous solvent cleaning processes. Records of relevant readings shall be maintained for early
detection of a trend towards an out of specification condition.
3. In the event that the result of a test is unacceptable, all the PWA's that were cleaned
since the last test that passed are considered unacceptable.
4. Failed PWA's shall not be recleaned until appropriate corrective actions have been
performed on the cleaning system to ensure its correct operation.
14.4 Test Limits
1. Resistivity of Solvent Extract. The resistivity of the solvent extract shall have a final
value greater than 2,000,000 ohm-cm.
2. Sodium Chloride (NaCl) Ionic Contamination Equivalent Test. The final value for
this test must be less than 1.55mg per sq/cm (10mg per sq/in.) of PWB surface area.
14.5 Resistivity Of Solvent Extract Test
Solvent extract resistivity shall be measured as follows (see Table 14-1).


1. Prepare a test solution of 75 percent by volume isopropyl alcohol and 25 percent by
volume deionized water. Pass this solution through a mixed bed deionizer cartridge. After passage
through the cartridge, the resistivity of the solution shall be greater than 6 x 106 ohm-cm
(conductivity less than 0.166 micromhos/cm).
2. Clean a funnel, a wash bottle, and a container with a portion of this test solution.
Measure out 1.55ml of fresh test solution for each sq/cm (10ml (.34fl oz) for each sq/in.) of
assembly area on both sides of the PWA.
3. Slowly direct the test solution in a fine stream onto both sides of the PWA until all
measured solution is used.
4. The resistivity of the solvent extract shall be determined using a resistivity meter.
14.6 Sodium Chloride (Nacl) Equivalent Ionic Contamination Test
Sodium chloride equivalent ionic contamination shall be measured as follows (see
Table 14-1):
Table 14-1.  Cleanliness Test Values
Test Method Starting Resistivity Ending Value
Resistivity of Solvent
Extract
6 x 106 ohm-cm Shall be greater than 2 x
106 ohm-cm
Sodium Chloride
Equivalent
20 x 106 ohm-cm Shall be less than
1.55mg/sq cm (10.0mg
(.34fl oz)/sq in.)
1. The sodium chloride equivalent ionic contamination test must use a solution of 75
percent isopropyl alcohol and 25 percent deionized water. This solution must be verified for
correct composition upon initial use and every 4 hours during a shift. The time limit may be
extended when the results of data provide definite indications that such actions will not adversely
affect the results of the test.
2. The equipment must be calibrated using a known amount of sodium chloride standard
on the same schedule as the percentage composition verification.
3. The starting or reference purity of the solution must be greater than 20 x 106 ohm-
centimeters (0.05 micromhos/centimeter) before each sample is tested.
4. Commercial equipment is available that can perform this test automatically. Such
equipment is recommended for the control of continuous solvent cleaning operations. The
equipment gives a direct readout in micrograms of NaCl per square centimeter (or square inch),
but requires careful calibration to the flux system used for accurate results.


CHAPTER 15 - VERIFICATION
When required by the procuring NASA Center, verification tests shall be conducted to establish
confidence in the reliability of the solder joints. A test plan shall be submitted to the procuring
NASA Center, or its designated representative, for approval. The test plan shall detail the test
environment, test duration, test assembly design, and failure criteria based on life and mission
