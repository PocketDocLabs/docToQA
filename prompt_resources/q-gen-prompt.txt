### Notes:


5 Ignition system - general
The ignition system includes the ignition
switch, the battery, the distributor, the primary
(low-voltage/low-tension or LT) and
secondary (high-voltage/high-tension or HT)
wiring circuits, the spark plugs and the spark
plug leads. Models fitted with a carburettor or
L-Jetronic fuel injection are equipped with a
Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system.
Models fitted with the Motronic fuel injection
system have the ignition system incorporated
within the Motronic system (Digital Motor
Electronics or DME).
Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI)
system
This system is has four major components;
the impulse generator, the ignition control
unit, the coil, and the spark plugs. The
impulse generator provides a timing signal for
the ignition system. Equivalent to cam-
actuated breaker points in a standard
distributor, the impulse generator creates an
A/C voltage signal every time the trigger
wheel tabs pass the impulse generator tabs.
When the ignition control unit (capacitive
discharge unit) receives the voltage signal, it
triggers a spark discharge from the coil by
interrupting the primary coil circuit. The
ignition dwell (coil charging time) is adjusted
by the ignition control unit for the most
intense spark. Note: The air gap (distance
between the impulse generator and trigger
wheel tabs) can be adjusted (see Section 11).
Ignition timing is mechanically adjusted
(see Section 7). A centrifugal advance unit
that consists of spring-loaded rotating
weights advances ignition timing as engine
speed increases. The vacuum advance
adjusts ignition timing to compensate for
changes in engine load.
Motronic ignition system
This system, also known as Digital Motor
Electronics (DME), incorporates all ignition
and fuel injection functions into one central
control unit or ECU (computer). The ignition
timing is based on inputs the ECU receives for
engine load, engine speed, coolant
temperature and intake air temperature. The
only function the distributor performs is the
distribution of the high voltage signal to the
individual spark plugs. The distributor is
attached directly to the cylinder head. There is
no mechanical spark advance system used on
these systems.
Ignition timing is electronically-controlled,
and is not adjustable on Motronic systems.
During starting, a crankshaft position sensor
(reference sensor) relays the crankshaft
position to the ECU, and an initial baseline
ignition point is determined. Once the engine
is running, the ignition timing is continually
changing, based on the various input signals
to the ECU. Engine speed is signalled by a
speed sensor. Early Motronic systems have
the position reference sensor and the speed
sensor mounted on the bellhousing over the
flywheel on the left-hand side. Later Motronic
systems have a single sensor (pulse sensor)
mounted over the crankshaft pulley. This
sensor functions as a speed sensor as well as
a position reference sensor. Refer to Sec-
tion 12 for checking and renewing the ignition
sensors. Note: Some models are equipped
with a TDC sensor mounted on the front of the
engine. This sensor is strictly for the BMW
service test unit, and it is not part of the
Motronic ignition system.
Precautions
Certain precautions must be observed
when working on a transistorised ignition
system.
a) Do not disconnect the battery cables
when the engine is running
b) Make sure the ignition control unit (TCI
ignition system) is always well earthed
(see Section 10).
c) Keep water away from the distributor and
HT leads.
d) If a tachometer is to be connected to the
engine, always connect the tachometer
positive (+) lead to the ignition coil
negative terminal (-) and never to the
distributor.
e) Do not allow the coil terminals to be
earthed, as the impulse generator or coil
could be damaged.
f) Do not leave the ignition switch on for
more than ten minutes with the engine
off, or if the engine will not start. 
6 Ignition system - check 2
Warning: Because of the high
voltage generated by the ignition
system, extreme care should be
taken whenever an operation is
performed involving ignition components.
This not only includes the impulse
generator (electronic ignition), coil,
distributor and spark plug HT leads, but
related components such as spark plug
connectors, tachometer and other test
equipment.
1 If the engine turns over but will not start,
disconnect the spark plug HT lead from any
spark plug, and attach it to a calibrated spark
tester (available at most car accessory 
shops). 
Note: There are two different types of spark
testers. Be sure to specify electronic
(breakerless) ignition. Connect the clip on the
tester to an earth point such as a metal
bracket (see illustration).
2 If you are unable to obtain a calibrated
spark tester, remove the spark plug HT lead
from one of the spark plugs. Using an
insulated tool, hold the lead about a quarter-
inch from the engine block - make sure the
gap is not more than a quarter-inch, or
damage may be caused to the electronic
components.
3 Crank the engine, and observe the tip of the
tester or spark plug HT lead to see if a spark
occurs. If bright-blue, well-defined sparks
occur, sufficient voltage is reaching the plugs
to fire the engine. However, the plugs
themselves may be fouled, so remove and
check them as described in Chapter 1.
4 If there’s no spark, check another HT lead
in the same manner. A few sparks followed by
no spark is the same condition as no spark at
all.
5 If no spark occurs, remove the distributor
cap, and check the cap and rotor as
described in Chapter 1. If moisture is present,
use a water-dispersant aerosol (or something
similar) to dry out the cap and rotor, then refit
the cap and repeat the spark test.
6 If there’s still no spark, disconnect the coil
HT lead from the distributor cap, and 
test this lead as described for the spark plug
leads.
7 If no spark occurs, check the primary wire
connections at the coil to make sure they’re
clean and tight. Make any necessary repairs,
then repeat the check.
8 If sparks do occur from the coil HT lead, the
distributor cap, rotor, plug HT lead(s) or spark
plug(s) may be defective. If there’s still no
spark, the coil-to-cap HT lead may be
defective. If a substitute lead doesn’t make
any difference, check the ignition coil (see
Section 9). Note: Refer to Sections 10 and 11
for more test procedures on the distributors
fitted with the TCI ignition system.
Engine electrical systems  5•3
6.1  To use a spark tester, simply
disconnect a spark plug HT lead, clip the
tester to a convenient earth (like a valve
cover bolt or nut) and operate the starter –
if there is enough power to fire the plug,
sparks will be visible between the
electrode tip and the tester body


7 Ignition timing (TCI system) -
check and adjustment 4
Warning: Keep hands, equipment
and wires well clear of the
viscous cooling fan during
adjustment of the ignition timing.
Note: This Section describes the procedure
for checking and adjusting the ignition timing
on engines fitted with the TCI system. On
engines fitted with the Motronic engine
management system, the ignition timing is
controlled by the electronic control unit, and
no adjustment is possible. The timing can be
checked using the following procedure, but no
ignition timing values were available at the
time of writing. If the timing is thought to be
incorrect, refer to a BMW dealer.
1 Some special tools are required for this
procedure (see illustration). The engine must
be at normal operating temperature, and the
air conditioning (where fitted) must be
switched off. Make sure the idle speed is
correct.
2 Apply the handbrake, and chock the wheels
to prevent movement of the vehicle. The
transmission must be in neutral (manual) or
Park (automatic).
3 The timing marks are located on the engine
flywheel (viewed through the timing check
hole in the bellhousing) and/or on the vibration
damper on the front of the engine.
4 Where applicable, disconnect the vacuum
hose from the distributor vacuum advance
unit.
5 Connect a tachometer and timing light
according to the equipment manufacturer’s
instructions (an inductive pick-up timing light
is preferred). Generally, the power leads for
the timing light are attached to the battery
terminals, and the pick-up lead is attached to
the No 1 spark plug HT lead. The No 1 spark
plug is the one at the front of the engine.
Caution: If an inductive pick-up
timing light isn’t available, don’t
puncture the spark plug HT lead
to attach the timing light pick-up
lead. Instead, use an adapter between the
spark plug and HT lead. If the insulation on
the HT lead is damaged, the secondary
voltage will jump to earth at the damaged
point, and the engine will misfire.
Note: On some models, a TDC transmitter is
fitted for checking the ignition system.
However, a special BMW tester must be
connected to the diagnostic socket to use it,
so unless the special tester is available, a
conventional timing light should be used. The
ignition timing mark may be on the vibration
damper, but if not, normally the TDC mark will
be. If the timing light is of the adjustable delay
type, then the ignition timing may be
determined by zeroing the adjustment, then
turning the adjustment until the TDC marks are
aligned, and then reading off the amount of
advance from the timing light. If a standard
timing light is being used, make a mark on the
vibration damper in accordance with the
specified advance, using the following formula
to calculate the distance from the TDC mark
to the timing mark:
Distance = 2Pr x advance
360
where P = 3.142
r = radius of vibration damper
advance = specified advance 
BTDC in degrees
6 With the ignition off, loosen the distributor
clamp nut just enough to allow the distributor
to pivot without any slipping.
7 Make sure the timing light wires are routed
away from the drivebelts and fan, then start
the engine.
8 Raise the engine rpm to the specified
speed, and then point the flashing timing light
at the timing marks - be very careful of moving
engine components.
9 The mark on the flywheel or vibration
damper will appear stationary. If it’s aligned
with the specified point on the bellhousing or
engine front cover, the ignition timing is
correct (see illustrations).
10 If the marks aren’t aligned, adjustment is
required. Turn the distributor very slowly until
the marks are aligned, taking care not to
touch the HT leads.
11 Tighten the nut on the distributor clamp,
and recheck the timing.
12 Switch off the engine, and remove the
timing light and tachometer. Reconnect the
vacuum hose where applicable.
8 Distributor - 
removal and refitting 4

Removal
1 After carefully marking them for position,
remove the coil HT lead and spark plug HT
leads from the distributor cap (see Chapter 1).
2 Remove No 1 spark plug (the one nearest
you when you are standing in front of the
engine).
3 Manually rotate the engine to Top Dead
Centre (TDC) on the compression stroke for
No 1 piston (see Chapter 2A)
4 Carefully mark the vacuum hoses, if more
than one is present on your distributor.
5 Disconnect the vacuum hose(s).
6 Disconnect the primary circuit wires from
the distributor.

turn as the distributor is inserted.
12 Refit the hold-down nut or bolt. The marks
previously made on the distributor housing,
and on the rotor and engine, should line up
before the nut or bolt is tightened.
13 Refit the distributor cap.
14 Connect the wiring for the distributor.
15 Reconnect the spark plug HT leads.
16 Reconnect the vacuum hoses as
previously marked.
17 Check the ignition timing (see Section 7).
Motronic system
Removal
18 Remove the cover from the distributor
(see illustration) and remove the distributor
cap (see Chapter 1).
19 Using a small Allen key, remove the three
screws from the rotor (see illustration).
20 Remove the rotor.
21 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
9 Ignition coil -
check and renewal 2
Caution: Do not earth the coil, as
the coil and/or impulse generator
could be damaged.
Note: On models equipped with the Motronic
system, a faulty ECU can cause the ignition
coil to become damaged. Be sure to test the
ignition coil if the engine will not start and an
ECU fault is suspected.
1 Mark the wires and terminals for position,
then remove the primary circuit wires and the
HT lead from the coil.
2 Remove the coil assembly from its
mounting, then clean the outer casing and
check it for cracks and other damage.
3 Inspect the coil primary terminals and the
coil tower terminal for corrosion. Clean them
with a wire brush if any corrosion is found.
4 Check the coil primary resistance by
attaching an ohmmeter to the primary
terminals (see illustrations). Compare the
measured resistance to the Specifications
listed in this Chapter.
5 Check the coil secondary resistance by
connecting one of the ohmmeter leads to one
of the primary terminals, and the other
ohmmeter lead to the coil high-tension
terminal (see illustrations). On TCI systems,

and the centre tower. On Motronic systems,
connect the ohmmeter to coil terminal 15 (+)
and the centre tower. Compare the measured
resistance with the values given in the Specifi-
cations in this Chapter.
6 If the measured resistances are not close to
those specified, the coil is defective and
should be renewed. Note that the measured
resistance will vary according to the
temperature of the coil, so don’t rush to
condemn the coil if the resistance is only a
little way out.
7 It is essential for proper ignition system
operation that all coil terminals and wire leads
be kept clean and dry.
8 Refit the coil in its mounting, and reconnect
the wiring. Refitting is the reverse of removal.
10 Impulse generator and
ignition control unit - check
and renewal (TCI system)
3
1 The impulse generator (located in the
distributor) and ignition control unit need to be
tested in the event there is no spark at the
spark plugs. Make sure the plug leads,
ignition coil and spark plugs are working
properly (see Sections 6 and 9). There are two
types of control units; Bosch or
Siemens/Telefunken. The two types (see
illustration) can be distinguished by their
electrical connectors. The Bosch type uses a
single, large rectangular connector at the
bottom of the unit, while the
Siemens/Telefunken control unit uses two
round electrical connectors at the front of the
unit.
Check
Voltage supply and earth to ignition
control unit
2 With the ignition off, remove the harness
connectors from the ignition control unit (see
illustrations). Connect a voltmeter between
connector terminals 2 and 4 on Bosch
systems, or between terminals 6 and 3 on
Siemens/Telefunken systems.
3 Turn the ignition on. There should be
battery voltage on the designated terminals. If
there is no voltage, check the wiring harness
for an open-circuit (see Chapter 12).
4 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity
between connector terminal 2 (Bosch) or 6
(Siemens/Telefunken) and the earth to the
vehicle body. Continuity should exist.
5 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity
between connector terminal 4 (Bosch) or 3
(Siemens/Telefunken) and terminal 15 of the
ignition coil. Continuity should exist.
6 If the readings are incorrect, repair the
wiring harness.

8 Use a digital voltmeter for the following
a) On Bosch systems, connect the positive
probe to connector terminal 5, and the
negative probe to terminal 6 (see
b) On Siemens/Telefunken systems, connect
the positive probe to terminal (+) of the
smaller connector, and the negative
probe to terminal (-).
9 Have an assistant crank the engine over,
and check that there is 1 to 2 volts A/C
present. If there is no voltage, check the
wiring harness between the impulse generator
(in the distributor) and the control unit. If the
harness is OK, check the impulse generator
resistance.
Warning: Do not crank the
engine over for an excessive
length of time. If necessary,
disconnect the cold start injector
electrical connector (see Chapter 4) to
stop the flow of fuel into the engine.
10 To check the resistance in the impulse
generator, proceed as described for your
system below:
a) On Bosch units, measure the resistance
between connector terminals 5 and 6
(see illustration 10.8). The reading
should be 1000 to 1200 ohms.
b) On Siemens/Telefunken units, measure
the resistance between the terminals of
the smaller connector. The reading should
be 1000 to 1200 ohms.
11 If the resistance readings are incorrect,
renew the impulse generator. If the resistance
readings for the impulse generator are correct
and the control unit voltages (supply voltage
[paragraphs 1 to 6] and signal voltage
[paragraphs 7 to 9]) are incorrect, renew the
control unit.
Renewal
Ignition control unit
12 Make sure the ignition is switched off.
13 Disconnect the electrical connector(s)
from the control unit.
14 Remove the mounting screws from the
control unit, and lift it from the engine
compartment.
15 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
On Bosch control units, a special dielectric
grease is used between the heat sink and the
back of the control unit. In the event the two
are separated (renewal or testing) the old
grease must be removed, and the heat sink
cleaned off using 180-grit sandpaper. Apply
Curil K2 (Bosch part number 81 22 9 243). A
silicon dielectric compound can be used as a
substitute. This treatment is very important for
the long life of these expensive ignition parts.
Impulse generator
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
16 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
17 Remove the distributor from the engine
(see Section 8).
18 Using a pair of circlip pliers, remove the
circlip retaining the trigger wheel (see
19 Use two flat-bladed screwdrivers
positioned at opposite sides of the trigger
wheel, and carefully prise it up (see
illustration). Note: Push the screwdrivers in
as far as possible without bending the trigger
wheel. Prise only on the strongest, centre
portion of the trigger wheel. In the event the
trigger wheel is bent, it must be replaced with
a new one. Note: Be sure not to lose the roll
pin when lifting out the trigger wheel.
20 Remove the mounting screws from the
impulse generator electrical connector, the
vacuum diaphragm and the baseplate.
21 Remove the two screws from the vacuum
advance unit, and separate it from the
distributor by moving the assembly down
while unhooking it from the baseplate pin.
22 Use circlip pliers to remove the circlip that
retains the impulse generator and the
baseplate assembly.
23 Carefully remove the impulse generator
and the baseplate assembly as a single unit.
24 Remove the three screws, and separate
the baseplate assembly from the impulse
generator.
25 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
Be sure to position the insulating ring between
the generator coil and the baseplate. It must
be centred before tightening the mounting
screws. Also, it will be necessary to
check/adjust the air gap if the trigger wheel
has been removed, or tampered with to the
point that the clearance is incorrect (see
Section 11).
11 Air gap (TCI system) - 
check and adjustment 2
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.

and down - you should feel a slight drag on
the feeler gauge as it is moved if the gap is
correct. The gap must be as given in this
Chapter’s Specifications.
3 To adjust the gap, it is necessary to remove
the impulse generator and the baseplate
assembly from the distributor (see illus-
tration 10.1).
4 Follow paragraphs 17 to 24 in Section 10
and loosen the screws that retain the impulse
generator to the baseplate assembly.
5 Carefully insert the feeler gauge and tighten
the screws.
6 Refit the assembly back into the distributor
and recheck the adjustment.
12 Ignition sensors (Motronic
system) - check and renewal 2
Note: Some models are equipped with a TDC
sensor mounted on the front of the engine.
This sensor is strictly for the BMW service test
unit, and is not part of the Motronic ignition
system.
Speed and position sensors
Check
1 Locate the two electrical connectors for the
sensors (see illustrations). The grey
connector is for the position sensor, and the
white connector is for the speed sensor.
2 Using an ohmmeter, check the resistance
between terminal 1 (yellow wire) and terminal
2 (black wire) on the sensor side of each
connector. The resistance should be 860 to
1,060 ohms.
3 Also check the resistance between terminal
3 and either terminal 1 or terminal 2. The
resistance should be approximately 100 000
ohms.
4 If the reading(s) are incorrect, renew the
sensor(s).
Renewal
5 Remove the sensor mounting screw(s),
using an Allen key where necessary, and pull
the sensor(s) from the sockets. Disconnect
the wiring from one sensor at a time - be sure
the connectors are not interchanged when
fitting new sensors. The bellhousing is marked
with a B for the position sensor (grey
connector) and D for the speed sensor (black
connector) (see illustration). Note: It is a
good idea to check the condition of the raised
pin on the flywheel while the sensors are out
of the sockets. Turn the engine by hand as
necessary to bring the pin into view.
6 Tighten the sensor mounting screw(s)
securely, but be careful not to overtighten.
Pulse sensor (later models)
Check
7 Locate the two electrical connectors for the
sensor (see illustrations). Disconnect the
electrical connector from the front. 
8 Using an ohmmeter, check resistance
between terminal 1 (yellow wire) and terminal
2 (black wire) on the sensor side of each
connector (see illustration). The resistance
should be 500 to 600 ohms.
9 If the reading is incorrect, renew the sensor.
Renewal

12 Tighten the mounting bolt, but be careful
not to overtighten it.
13 Charging system - general
information and precautions
There are two different types of alternator
fitted on these models; Bosch and Motorola.
Also, there are three different amperage
ratings available; 65A, 80A or 90A. A stamped
serial number on the rear of the alternator will
identify the type and amperage rating.
Perform the charging system checks (see
Section 14) to diagnose any problems with the
alternator.
The voltage regulator and the alternator
brushes are mounted as a single assembly.
On Bosch alternators, this unit can be
removed from the alternator (see Section 16)
and the components serviced individually.
The alternator on all models is mounted on
the left front of the engine, and utilises a V-
belt and pulley drive system. Drivebelt tension
and battery servicing are the two primary
maintenance requirements for these systems.
See Chapter 1 for the procedures regarding
engine drivebelt checking and battery
servicing.
The ignition/no-charge warning light should
come on when the ignition key is turned to
Start, then go off immediately the engine
starts. If it remains on, there is a malfunction
in the charging system (see Section 14). Some
vehicles are also equipped with a voltmeter. If
the voltmeter indicates abnormally high or low
voltage, check the charging system (see
Section 14). Note: On models up to 1986, a
blown ignition/no-charge warning light will
prevent the alternator from charging. After
1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the
warning light in order to allow current to
bypass the light in the event of a broken circuit
(blown warning light).
Precautions
Be very careful when making electrical
circuit connections to the alternator, and note
the following:
a) When reconnecting wires to the alternator
from the battery, be sure to note the
polarity.
b) Before using arc-welding equipment to
repair any part of the vehicle, disconnect
the wires from the battery terminals and
from the alternator.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
c) Never start the engine with a battery
charger connected. Always disconnect
both battery cables before using a battery
charger.
d) Never disconnect cables from the battery
or from the alternator while the engine is
running.
e) The alternator is turned by an engine
drivebelt. Serious injury could result if
your hands, hair or clothes become
entangled in the belt with the engine
running.
f) Because the alternator is connected
directly to the battery, take care not to
short out the main terminal to earth.
g) Wrap a plastic bag over the alternator,
and secure it with rubber bands, before
steam-cleaning the engine.
14 Charging system - check 3
1 If a malfunction occurs in the charging
circuit, don’t automatically assume that the
alternator is causing the problem. First check
the following items:
a) Check the drivebelt tension and condition
(see Chapter 1). Renew the drivebelt if it’s
worn or deteriorated.
b) Make sure the alternator mounting and
adjustment bolts are tight.
c) Inspect the alternator wiring harness and
the connectors at the alternator and
voltage regulator. They must be in good
condition and tight.
d) Check the fuses.
e) Start the engine and check the alternator
for abnormal noises (a shrieking or
squealing sound indicates a worn bearing,
but could also be due to a slipping
drivebelt - see a) above).
f) Check the specific gravity of the battery
electrolyte. If it’s low, charge the battery
(doesn’t apply to maintenance-free
batteries).
g) Make sure the battery is fully-charged
(one bad cell in a battery can cause
overcharging by the alternator).
h) Disconnect the battery cables (negative
first, then positive). Inspect the battery
posts and the cable clamps for corrosion.
Clean them thoroughly if necessary (see
Chapter 1).
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
2 With the ignition off, connect a 12 volt test
light between the battery negative post and
the disconnected negative cable clamp. If the
test light does not come on, refit the cable
and proceed to paragraph 4. If the test light
comes on, there is a short (drain) in the
electrical system of the vehicle. The short
must be repaired before the charging system
can be checked. Note: Accessories which are
always on (such as the clock or the radio
station memory) must be disconnected before
performing this check.
3 Disconnect the alternator wiring harness. If
the test light now goes out, the alternator is
faulty. If the light stays on, remove each fuse
in turn until the light goes out (this will tell you
which component is shorting out).
4 Using a voltmeter, check the battery
voltage with the engine off. It should be
approximately 12 volts.
5 Start the engine and check the battery
voltage again. It should now be approximately
14 to 15 volts.
6 Turn on the headlights. The voltage should
drop, and then come back up, if the charging
system is working properly.
7 If the voltage reading is more than the
specified charging voltage, renew the voltage
regulator (refer to Section 16). If the voltage is
less, the alternator diode(s), stator or rotor
may be faulty, or the voltage regulator may be
malfunctioning.
8 If there is no short-circuit causing battery
drain but the battery is constantly
discharging, then either the battery itself is
defective, the alternator drivebelt is loose (see
Chapter 1), the alternator brushes are worn,
dirty or disconnected (see Section 17), the
voltage regulator is malfunctioning (see
Section 16) or the diodes, stator coil or rotor
coil are defective. Repairing or renewing the
diodes, stator coil or rotor coil is beyond the
scope of the home mechanic. Either renew
12.11  The sensor tip should be set at 1.0 ±
0.3 mm from the pulse wheel


the alternator complete, or take it to an
automotive electrician, who may be able to
overhaul it. Note: On models up to 1986, a
blown ignition/no-charge warning light bulb
will prevent the alternator from charging. After
1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the
warning light, in order to allow current to
bypass the light in the event of a broken circuit
(blown warning light).
15 Alternator - 
removal and refitting 1
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Detach the battery negative cable.
2 Detach the electrical connectors from the
alternator, noting their locations for refitting
(see illustration). Note: On some models, it
may be necessary to remove the air cleaner
assembly and airflow meter to gain access to
the alternator.
3 Loosen the alternator adjustment and pivot
bolts, and slip off the drivebelt (see Chap-
ter 1).
4 Remove the adjustment and pivot bolts,
and separate the alternator from the engine.
Refitting
5 If you are renewing the alternator, take the
old one with you when purchasing a new or
reconditioned unit. Make sure the new unit
looks identical to the old alternator. Look at
the terminals - they should be the same in
number, size and location as the terminals on
the old alternator. Finally, look at the identifi-
cation numbers - they will be stamped into the
housing, or printed on a tag attached to the
housing. Make sure the numbers are the same
on both alternators.
6 Many new alternators do not come with a
pulley fitted, so you may have to transfer the
pulley from the old unit to the new one.
7 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
8 After the alternator is fitted, adjust the
drivebelt tension (see Chapter 1).
9 Check the charging voltage to verify 
proper operation of the alternator (see Sec-
tion 14).
16 Voltage regulator - renewal 1
1 The voltage regulator controls the charging
system voltage by limiting the alternator
output. The regulator is a sealed unit, and isn’t
adjustable.
2 If the voltmeter indicates that the alternator
is not charging (or if the ignition/no-charge
warning light comes on) and the alternator,
battery, drivebelt tension and electrical
connections seem to be fine, have the
regulator checked by a dealer service
department or electrical specialist.
3 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Bosch alternator
4 The voltage regulator is mounted externally
on the alternator housing. To renew the
regulator, remove the mounting screws (see
illustration) and lift it off the alternator (see
illustration). Note: Some Bosch alternators
have an integral voltage regulator which is part
of the brush assembly.
5 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
Before refitting the regulator, check the
condition of the slip rings (see illustration).
Use a torch and check for any scoring or deep
wear grooves. Renew the alternator if
necessary.
Motorola alternator
6 Remove the alternator from the engine
compartment (see Section 15).
7 Remove the rear cover and diode carrier,
remove the voltage regulator mounting
screws (see illustration) and lift the regulator
off the alternator body.
8 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
17 Alternator brushes - 
check and renewal 3
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
