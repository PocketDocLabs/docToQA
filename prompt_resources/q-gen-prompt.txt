### Notes:


5 Ignition system - general
The ignition system includes the ignition
switch, the battery, the distributor, the primary
(low-voltage/low-tension or LT) and
secondary (high-voltage/high-tension or HT)
wiring circuits, the spark plugs and the spark
plug leads. Models fitted with a carburettor or
L-Jetronic fuel injection are equipped with a
Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system.
Models fitted with the Motronic fuel injection
system have the ignition system incorporated
within the Motronic system (Digital Motor
Electronics or DME).
Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI)
system
This system is has four major components;
the impulse generator, the ignition control
unit, the coil, and the spark plugs. The
impulse generator provides a timing signal for
the ignition system. Equivalent to cam-
actuated breaker points in a standard
distributor, the impulse generator creates an
A/C voltage signal every time the trigger
wheel tabs pass the impulse generator tabs.
When the ignition control unit (capacitive
discharge unit) receives the voltage signal, it
triggers a spark discharge from the coil by
interrupting the primary coil circuit. The
ignition dwell (coil charging time) is adjusted
by the ignition control unit for the most
intense spark. Note: The air gap (distance
between the impulse generator and trigger
wheel tabs) can be adjusted (see Section 11).
Ignition timing is mechanically adjusted
(see Section 7). A centrifugal advance unit
that consists of spring-loaded rotating
weights advances ignition timing as engine
speed increases. The vacuum advance
adjusts ignition timing to compensate for
changes in engine load.
Motronic ignition system
This system, also known as Digital Motor
Electronics (DME), incorporates all ignition
and fuel injection functions into one central
control unit or ECU (computer). The ignition
timing is based on inputs the ECU receives for
engine load, engine speed, coolant
temperature and intake air temperature. The
only function the distributor performs is the
distribution of the high voltage signal to the
individual spark plugs. The distributor is
attached directly to the cylinder head. There is
no mechanical spark advance system used on
these systems.
Ignition timing is electronically-controlled,
and is not adjustable on Motronic systems.
During starting, a crankshaft position sensor
(reference sensor) relays the crankshaft
position to the ECU, and an initial baseline
ignition point is determined. Once the engine
is running, the ignition timing is continually
changing, based on the various input signals
to the ECU. Engine speed is signalled by a
speed sensor. Early Motronic systems have
the position reference sensor and the speed
sensor mounted on the bellhousing over the
flywheel on the left-hand side. Later Motronic
systems have a single sensor (pulse sensor)
mounted over the crankshaft pulley. This
sensor functions as a speed sensor as well as
a position reference sensor. Refer to Sec-
tion 12 for checking and renewing the ignition
sensors. Note: Some models are equipped
with a TDC sensor mounted on the front of the
engine. This sensor is strictly for the BMW
service test unit, and it is not part of the
Motronic ignition system.
Precautions
Certain precautions must be observed
when working on a transistorised ignition
system.
a) Do not disconnect the battery cables
when the engine is running
b) Make sure the ignition control unit (TCI
ignition system) is always well earthed
(see Section 10).
c) Keep water away from the distributor and
HT leads.
d) If a tachometer is to be connected to the
engine, always connect the tachometer
positive (+) lead to the ignition coil
negative terminal (-) and never to the
distributor.
e) Do not allow the coil terminals to be
earthed, as the impulse generator or coil
could be damaged.
f) Do not leave the ignition switch on for
more than ten minutes with the engine
off, or if the engine will not start. 
6 Ignition system - check 2
Warning: Because of the high
voltage generated by the ignition
system, extreme care should be
taken whenever an operation is
performed involving ignition components.
This not only includes the impulse
generator (electronic ignition), coil,
distributor and spark plug HT leads, but
related components such as spark plug
connectors, tachometer and other test
equipment.
1 If the engine turns over but will not start,
disconnect the spark plug HT lead from any
spark plug, and attach it to a calibrated spark
tester (available at most car accessory 
shops). 
Note: There are two different types of spark
testers. Be sure to specify electronic
(breakerless) ignition. Connect the clip on the
tester to an earth point such as a metal
bracket (see illustration).
2 If you are unable to obtain a calibrated
spark tester, remove the spark plug HT lead
from one of the spark plugs. Using an
insulated tool, hold the lead about a quarter-
inch from the engine block - make sure the
gap is not more than a quarter-inch, or
damage may be caused to the electronic
components.
3 Crank the engine, and observe the tip of the
tester or spark plug HT lead to see if a spark
occurs. If bright-blue, well-defined sparks
occur, sufficient voltage is reaching the plugs
to fire the engine. However, the plugs
themselves may be fouled, so remove and
check them as described in Chapter 1.
4 If there’s no spark, check another HT lead
in the same manner. A few sparks followed by
no spark is the same condition as no spark at
all.
5 If no spark occurs, remove the distributor
cap, and check the cap and rotor as
described in Chapter 1. If moisture is present,
use a water-dispersant aerosol (or something
similar) to dry out the cap and rotor, then refit
the cap and repeat the spark test.
6 If there’s still no spark, disconnect the coil
HT lead from the distributor cap, and 
test this lead as described for the spark plug
leads.
7 If no spark occurs, check the primary wire
connections at the coil to make sure they’re
clean and tight. Make any necessary repairs,
then repeat the check.
8 If sparks do occur from the coil HT lead, the
distributor cap, rotor, plug HT lead(s) or spark
plug(s) may be defective. If there’s still no
spark, the coil-to-cap HT lead may be
defective. If a substitute lead doesn’t make
any difference, check the ignition coil (see
Section 9). Note: Refer to Sections 10 and 11
for more test procedures on the distributors
fitted with the TCI ignition system.
Engine electrical systems  5•3
6.1  To use a spark tester, simply
disconnect a spark plug HT lead, clip the
tester to a convenient earth (like a valve
cover bolt or nut) and operate the starter –
if there is enough power to fire the plug,
sparks will be visible between the
electrode tip and the tester body


7 Ignition timing (TCI system) -
check and adjustment 4
Warning: Keep hands, equipment
and wires well clear of the
viscous cooling fan during
adjustment of the ignition timing.
Note: This Section describes the procedure
for checking and adjusting the ignition timing
on engines fitted with the TCI system. On
engines fitted with the Motronic engine
management system, the ignition timing is
controlled by the electronic control unit, and
no adjustment is possible. The timing can be
checked using the following procedure, but no
ignition timing values were available at the
time of writing. If the timing is thought to be
incorrect, refer to a BMW dealer.
1 Some special tools are required for this
procedure (see illustration). The engine must
be at normal operating temperature, and the
air conditioning (where fitted) must be
switched off. Make sure the idle speed is
correct.
2 Apply the handbrake, and chock the wheels
to prevent movement of the vehicle. The
transmission must be in neutral (manual) or
Park (automatic).
3 The timing marks are located on the engine
flywheel (viewed through the timing check
hole in the bellhousing) and/or on the vibration
damper on the front of the engine.
4 Where applicable, disconnect the vacuum
hose from the distributor vacuum advance
unit.
5 Connect a tachometer and timing light
according to the equipment manufacturer’s
instructions (an inductive pick-up timing light
is preferred). Generally, the power leads for
the timing light are attached to the battery
terminals, and the pick-up lead is attached to
the No 1 spark plug HT lead. The No 1 spark
plug is the one at the front of the engine.
Caution: If an inductive pick-up
timing light isn’t available, don’t
puncture the spark plug HT lead
to attach the timing light pick-up
lead. Instead, use an adapter between the
spark plug and HT lead. If the insulation on
the HT lead is damaged, the secondary
voltage will jump to earth at the damaged
point, and the engine will misfire.
Note: On some models, a TDC transmitter is
fitted for checking the ignition system.
However, a special BMW tester must be
connected to the diagnostic socket to use it,
so unless the special tester is available, a
conventional timing light should be used. The
ignition timing mark may be on the vibration
damper, but if not, normally the TDC mark will
be. If the timing light is of the adjustable delay
type, then the ignition timing may be
determined by zeroing the adjustment, then
turning the adjustment until the TDC marks are
aligned, and then reading off the amount of
advance from the timing light. If a standard
timing light is being used, make a mark on the
vibration damper in accordance with the
specified advance, using the following formula
to calculate the distance from the TDC mark
to the timing mark:
Distance = 2Pr x advance
360
where P = 3.142
r = radius of vibration damper
advance = specified advance 
BTDC in degrees
6 With the ignition off, loosen the distributor
clamp nut just enough to allow the distributor
to pivot without any slipping.
7 Make sure the timing light wires are routed
away from the drivebelts and fan, then start
the engine.
8 Raise the engine rpm to the specified
speed, and then point the flashing timing light
at the timing marks - be very careful of moving
engine components.
9 The mark on the flywheel or vibration
damper will appear stationary. If it’s aligned
with the specified point on the bellhousing or
engine front cover, the ignition timing is
correct (see illustrations).
10 If the marks aren’t aligned, adjustment is
required. Turn the distributor very slowly until
the marks are aligned, taking care not to
touch the HT leads.
11 Tighten the nut on the distributor clamp,
and recheck the timing.
12 Switch off the engine, and remove the
timing light and tachometer. Reconnect the
vacuum hose where applicable.
8 Distributor - 
removal and refitting 4
TCI system
Removal
1 After carefully marking them for position,
remove the coil HT lead and spark plug HT
leads from the distributor cap (see Chapter 1).
2 Remove No 1 spark plug (the one nearest
you when you are standing in front of the

10 Before refitting the distributor, make
certain No 1 piston is still at TDC on the
11 Insert the distributor into the engine, with
the adjusting clamp centred over the hold-
down hole. Make allowance for the gear to
turn as the distributor is inserted.
12 Refit the hold-down nut or bolt. The marks
previously made on the distributor housing,
and on the rotor and engine, should line up
before the nut or bolt is tightened.
13 Refit the distributor cap.
14 Connect the wiring for the distributor.
15 Reconnect the spark plug HT leads.
16 Reconnect the vacuum hoses as
previously marked.
17 Check the ignition timing (see Section 7).
Motronic system
Removal
18 Remove the cover from the distributor
(see illustration) and remove the distributor
cap (see Chapter 1).
19 Using a small Allen key, remove the three
screws from the rotor (see illustration).
20 Remove the rotor.
21 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
9 Ignition coil -
check and renewal 2
Caution: Do not earth the coil, as
the coil and/or impulse generator
could be damaged.
Note: On models equipped with the Motronic
system, a faulty ECU can cause the ignition
coil to become damaged. Be sure to test the
ignition coil if the engine will not start and an
ECU fault is suspected.
1 Mark the wires and terminals for position,
then remove the primary circuit wires and the
HT lead from the coil.
2 Remove the coil assembly from its
mounting, then clean the outer casing and
check it for cracks and other damage.
3 Inspect the coil primary terminals and the
coil tower terminal for corrosion. Clean them
with a wire brush if any corrosion is found.
4 Check the coil primary resistance by
attaching an ohmmeter to the primary
terminals (see illustrations). Compare the
measured resistance to the Specifications
listed in this Chapter.
5 Check the coil secondary resistance by
connecting one of the ohmmeter leads to one
of the primary terminals, and the other
ohmmeter lead to the coil high-tension
terminal (see illustrations). On TCI systems,

secondary resistance of the coil (TCI
system)
9.4b  Some Motronic systems use a
different type of coil. First, remove the coil
cover and . . .
9.4a  Using an ohmmeter, measure the
resistance between the primary terminals
of the ignition coil (TCI system shown)
9.4c  . . . using an ohmmeter, measure the
resistance between the primary terminals


connect the ohmmeter to coil terminal 1 (-)
and the centre tower. On Motronic systems,
connect the ohmmeter to coil terminal 15 (+)
and the centre tower. Compare the measured
resistance with the values given in the Specifi-
cations in this Chapter.
6 If the measured resistances are not close to
those specified, the coil is defective and
should be renewed. Note that the measured
resistance will vary according to the
temperature of the coil, so don’t rush to
condemn the coil if the resistance is only a
little way out.
7 It is essential for proper ignition system
operation that all coil terminals and wire leads
be kept clean and dry.
8 Refit the coil in its mounting, and reconnect
the wiring. Refitting is the reverse of removal.
10 Impulse generator and
ignition control unit - check
and renewal (TCI system)
3
1 The impulse generator (located in the
distributor) and ignition control unit need to be
tested in the event there is no spark at the
spark plugs. Make sure the plug leads,
ignition coil and spark plugs are working
properly (see Sections 6 and 9). There are two
types of control units; Bosch or
Siemens/Telefunken. The two types (see
illustration) can be distinguished by their
electrical connectors. The Bosch type uses a
single, large rectangular connector at the
bottom of the unit, while the
Siemens/Telefunken control unit uses two
round electrical connectors at the front of the
unit.
Check
Voltage supply and earth to ignition
control unit
2 With the ignition off, remove the harness
connectors from the ignition control unit (see
illustrations). Connect a voltmeter between
connector terminals 2 and 4 on Bosch
systems, or between terminals 6 and 3 on
Siemens/Telefunken systems.
3 Turn the ignition on. There should be
battery voltage on the designated terminals. If
there is no voltage, check the wiring harness
for an open-circuit (see Chapter 12).
4 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity
between connector terminal 2 (Bosch) or 6
(Siemens/Telefunken) and the earth to the
vehicle body. Continuity should exist.
5 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity
between connector terminal 4 (Bosch) or 3
(Siemens/Telefunken) and terminal 15 of the
ignition coil. Continuity should exist.
6 If the readings are incorrect, repair the
wiring harness.
