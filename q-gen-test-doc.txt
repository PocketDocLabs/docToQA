## Central Maneuver

21. A SCHEMATIC CLA.ssxuIcATIoN OF MANEUVER. In the progress of investigation, a point is now reached where one can profitably examine the principal types of maneuver. Upon examination it will be found that these types are clearly derived from the initial basic factors of combination of directions, relative distribution of forces, and a maneuver idea, which controls the initial die.

position or grouping of forces.

"Attack" is obviously the culminating point of maneuver, the final act in a drama based on maneuver, the tactical expression of the maneuver idea. The embryo of attack stirring uneasily in the march formations of the Imperial Army was shown in the advance on Eylau. The terms "penetration, envelopment, turning movement," ordinarily found in official texts, describe the act, as a form of execution. To penetratewhere? To envelopwhat flank? There is an amplifying terminology possible that is not based on a description of the act, but rather on its location, on the vast battle fronts of modern armies; and that is a classification as flank maneuvers, on a flank or wing, and central maneuvers, in the center of the general dispositions. Under these headings, there are additional subdivisions of maneuver forms that have appeared on a thousand battlefields and in a thou.

sand texts.

At the outset, it should be noted that this text does not primarily seek to establish the superiority of one form or another. This is simply an endeavor to recognize the properties of each and to note their conditions of execution.

However, flank maneuvers will eventually emerge as the most important maneuver form.

As you reflect on the schematic diagram, it is apparent that each type of maneuver requires special preparatory dispositions.

For a converging attack, for instance, the units will have to be placed abreast and widely spaced at the start, or they will collide rather than converge. A point involved in spacing them is whether they converge in front or in rear of a hostile area.

For a close-in envelopment, the initial disposition involves a line approximately equal in extent to that of the enemy and the location of reserves in rear of the flank which is to be enveloped. 2
For a wide envelopment, or turning movement,3 the enveloping mass must be detached rather early, in order to gain the necessary distance in an attack direction which completely clears the hostile flank.

Certain preliminary conditions appear as a characteristic of all types of maneuver.

This is just another angle to a general problema final argument, for the prearranged maneuver, which finds early expression in initial march formations.

The dose relation between initial dispositions and the subsequent maneuver has one glaring disadvantage, howeverthe preliminary disposition may reveal the projected maneuver. The enemy may recognize it by deduction. This is increasingly more important, as the efficiency of aerial reconnaissance has enormously increased. The air service is here to stay; it cannot possibly be excluded from any future strategical maneuver.

Apart from night marches, practically the only parry against the menace of aerial observation and the loss of surprise, consists in maintaining what might be termed an amorphous dispositionshapeless, not crystallized, but capable of rapid transformation at the last moment.

Numerous examples of this sort can be found in military history, particularly in the Napoleonic campaigns; of course, they are not useful in their archaic form, but they suggest the direction in which a modern solution may be sought.

22. OPERATION ON INTERIOR LINES. This maneuver was frequently resorted to in the past; the Napoleonic campaigns of 1796, 1813 and 1814 are examples.

Hindenburg used it in Poland in 1914 and 1915. The system presupposes that thc enemy is dispersed in groups which are too far separated to be able to participate in the same action; the idea is to defeat the enemy in detail, containing one fraction with a detachment while faIling upon the other with the bulk of one's forces; this is merely an application of the old principle of economy of force.

The Austrians, under Beauiieu, and the Sardinians, under Colli, faced the French along the Appenines. Napoleon concentrated mass in the gap between the Miles. He first attacked the Austrians at Montenotte, driving them from their positions; the gap widened.

Containing the Austrians with a detached force, Napoleon immediately turned against the Sardinians and defeated them at Millessimo; the gap widened still more. The subsequent operations were characteristic, maneuvers on interior lines, with Bonaparte reinforcing one or the other wing to create a local superiority.

The apparent simplicity of the procedure may give one a false idea that it is easyl Great strength of soul and character are necessary to play such a desperate game. The campaign of Tannenberg is a brilliant modern example of the maneuver on interior lines.

First phase: Note the initial basic conditions profitable.

which make such a maneuver a. The enemy is divided into two masses: one fragment cannot immediately support the other.

Ii. The separation is brought about by a terrain feature: a chain of lakes.

c. One fraction of the enemy is contained by detached forces, in a preliminary action.

d. Rapid concentration of mass is effected against the remaining fraction.

e. Its defeat is accomplished by a converging attack: a double envelopment.

Second phase: Note the immediate regrouping of the German forces for an attack on the initial enemy fraction with a view to defeating it in turn.

It is possible, however, that the dispersion of the enemy takes place in the course of battle and may lead to isolating a part of the enemy forces; the procedure against this fraction is then analogous to an operation on interior lines.

French military thought appears to be much impressed with this type of action and has given it a special name, "action of dislocation."
23. DISLOCATION: FRAGMENTATION OF THE FRONT. The French terminology means nothing more or less than "exploiting a gap in the line." Every recent war contains examples of fragmentation of the enemy's front and opportunities for exploiting it by maneuver.

## 1St Phase Russians Germans P".'_ M

a. The Russo-Japanese War, 1904. Two days after the launching of the Japanese counteroffensive in the morning of i October, the Russian line was
"dislocated" into three groups, echeloned on a front of approximately o miles.

The Japanese. however, did not profit by this situation since they had already oriented their principal maneuver against the Russian right wing.

b. The World War, 1914. A more aggressive enemy took prompt advantage of a similar situation, on 22 August 1914, in the Battle of the Ardennes. The French Fourth Army was advancing on a front of about 40 miles. Note the general dispositions of the corps, divisions and brigades in echelon, from north.

west to southeast; each column, echeloned to the rear, was expected to protect the flank of the preceding column; due to delays in marching, numerous gaps developed and the east flank of certain columns became uncovered and exposed.

The terrain was unfavorable; parallel bands of wooded zones extended, in general, across the direction of advance of the French, while the advance of the Germans, from east to west, was made in clearings; the routes of the French became virtual defiles in the forest. Liaison with neighboring units was practically impossible; this led to isolated actions; divisions and even brigades had to fight as if in separate compartments; the result was a series of isolated combats and defeat in detail.

Certain conditions seem to be present in all instancesextended fronts and compartmented terrain.

These are the same conditions that are prerequisites for the maneuver on interior lines.

In the Wars of i866 and 1870, generally opposite circumstances were present.

French and Austrians fought on comparatively narrow fronts and fought defensively. Maneuver against the center was not indicated; one can understand why the Germans preferred flank manuevers.

The French professional regard for the tactical possibilities of "dislocation"
is probably traceable to the dark days of August 1914 when their first successes along the Marne were due primarily to the exploitation of gaps in the line.

This situation and the march of the German First Army to the Ourcq have been covered in preceding paragraphs.

The withdrawal of the German Ill and IX Corps to support von Kiuck in the battle of the Ourcq, had created a wide gap between the First and Second Armies; von Kiuck's Army was split, one section facing west and heavily engaged with the French, the other attached to the right wing of von Bulow's Second Army and facing south.

The British Expeditionary Force and the French Fifth Army began to enter this gap; they had in front of them only Marwitz's cavalry fighting delaying actions on a wide front.

## Plate 55. The Battle Of The Ardennes. I.

On this same front, there is another example of the exploitation of a gap in the line: von Kiuck's movements had been pulling von Bulow more and more to the west; on g September, this displacement resulted in a gap between La Fere Champenoise and the marshes of St. Gond; Foch recognized this gap and drew in his last division. 8
24. THE PENETRATION, a. General considerations. Military literature and official doctrine agree, perhaps reluctantly, to acknowledge and accept penetration as a form of attack.

Through its World War experience on stabilized fronts, the present generation should be expert in "penetration"a frontal attack leading to a breakthrough. It was found that a penetration is not in itself a decisive act; in the evolution of combat, it belongs to the preparatory phase.

In the wars of the ancients, the Greek phalanx and the Roman legion, composed of infantry, conducted what was a frontal attack pure and simple. The decision, if any, was invariably brought on by cavalry actions on the flanks.

With the advent of firearms and more supple formations, such as the division, infantry was able to extend its former simple action of frontal attack to include maneuver in a combination of directions.

Napoleon used this supple instrument to the limit of its capacities. It is significant that the majority of his maneuvers were flank maneuvers. He did not hesitate to attempt an occasional breakthrough, but he found it to be an expensive undertaking. At Lutzen, he lost 3o,ooo men or as much as his enemies, but he could afford it less; at Waterloo, d'Erlon's Corps suffered per cent losses in less than an hour. In the American Civil War our experience was very similar.

Just prior to the World War, the French and Germans held divergent views on the value of penetration. The French Regulations on the Conduct of Large Units, 1913, stated that "frontal attacks, leading to a tactical break-through, may lead to a decisive success."
The German school of thought, however, was not in favor of frontal attacks with a view to a penetration. This school was thoroughly indoctrinated with the views of Count Schlieffen, Chief of the German General Staff from 1891 to
1905. Schlieffen said, in substance: "Frontal attack is indecisive, since it merely drives the enemy to a new position
.

.

. a new operation must be started. This may be all right if you have plenty of timebut not when you are counting minutes
. do not attack frontally; the thing to do is to crush the enemy's flanks."
Count Schlieffen was not blind to certain possibilities of penetration. In a staff ride, he had occasion to remark: "Everybody wants to envelopconsequently, everybody extends their flanks. And so it goes onuntil you are stretched to the limitoverextended. Then you think of a penetration. But where, at what point? Nowadays, there won't be any high point, from which the commander can observe the battle in its entirety and personally discover the weak spot in the enemy's lines."
Impressed with his views, the German armies of 1914 relied on flank maneuvers and attempted no penetration, except when the fluctuation of battle practically forced them to it, as was the situation of the German First Army in the first battle of the Marne in 1914.

In the paralysis of stabilized warfare, 1915 to 1917, the penetration became highly developed as the only remaining form of the attack and was practiced by all opponents; the following operations are characteristic American types.

b. The regiment in penetration: Cantigny, 28 May 1918.

Cantigny formed the apex of the German salient toward Amiens and was on the natural approach to cut the AmiensCompiegne railroad. The sector was well organized and particularly strong in artillery support. The town contained numerous and strong machine-gun positions. Full advantage had been taken of the ruins, cellars, etc., to improve the defense. It was held, at the time, by the
8ad German Reserve Division (271st and 272d Reserve Regiments). '

The 28th U. S. Infantry, Colonel H. E. Ely commanding, was designated to make the attack. As a concession to the psychological importance of this opera.

tion, extraordinary preparations were made to insure success. The attack was rehearsed in the rear areas, near Maisoncelle and St. Eusoye; the departure trenches were laid out and the town with its various important defenses patterned on the ground, in order to familiarize the command with distances and locations.

The officers studied a relief map of the terrain around Cantigny, on a large sand table, and recent oblique and direct airplane photographs and a sketch showing the location of important cellars, dugouts, and shelters were issued to include platoon commanders."
The plans for the attack were drawn by the American staff. So thorough were the plans and orders issued that when submitted to the French corps commander for approval, no changes were found necessary. 12
The formation of the regiment for the attack was with three battalions abreast, each battalion with three companies in line and one in reserve; one machinegun company had been attached to each battalion. A section of flame-throwers, a group of 12 Schneider tanks, aviation, and certain artillery units were furnished by the French; the artillery support for the attack was markedly strong: 22
batteries -mm. guns, six of i 55-mms., 178 heavy guns and howitzers, and 40
trench mortars, in addition to the organic divisional artillery.

After one hour of artillery preparation the attack was launched at 6:45 A. M.,
28 May, under cover of a rolling barrage which advanced at the rate of 24
minutes per hundred meters. The advance was made with the precision of a peacetime maneuver.

The American infantry followed so close behind the barrage and supporting tanks that the enemy had no time to emerge from his shelters and was either killed or surrendered in considerable numbers. The objective was reached by
7:20 A. M. and the work of consolidation begun immediately. The reaction of the Germans against the American troops was extremely violent. Counterattacks were launched on the 28th, 2gth and oth, but were repulsed. The sudden withdrawal of the French supporting artillery, for service against the German drive of 28 May, enabled the stronger German artillery to concentrate a merciless fire on the new American position; most of the American losses occurred during that period. After o May, the fire gradually decreased and the sector became cornpartively quiet. The 28th Infantry was relieved by the i6th Infantry (i June).

The losses incurred amounted to 4 officers and 1,022 men.

The facile demonstration at Cantigny greatly impressed the French; 1 thereafter the Allies accepted the fact that the Americans could be depended upon. '
c. The Division in penetration: Soissons, 18 July 1918.

The position of the Germans in the Marne salient was inherently weak; it was out of the question to supply the large number of divisions in the salient for any length of time. The chief reliance was of necessity upon motor vehicles, and the supply of gasoline was limited. As early as June 6, General Pershing suggested to Marshal Petain that "a blow at the enemy's line south of Soissons, if successful, would compel him to retire. I was very eager that our troops should be allowed to undertake such an attack." 15
During the engagement along the Somme, Marshal Foch ordered preliminary

The impression which the Germans gained of Americans, in these early engagements, was entirely avoue tactical training of the American infantry appeared deficient, and the American soldier was awkward and very careless.

The artillery appeared more efficient and had the habit, to systematically search the battle field.

But the physical condition of the men, equipment, and supply appeared to us extraordinary, and the perU
sonal bravery and initiative of certain individuals very great.

The Americans were always engaged in small.

offensive operations to harass and fatigue our weary troops, and stopped at nothing to gain their objectives.

The Americans made a profound impression on the German soldier; this waa due to the nervous exhaustion of our troops. fatigued by the excessive demands of the recent major offensives.

The military significance of the support of the Americans was not only based upon their mass, but more especially on their nervous resistance.

These troops were characterizd by absolute fitness, a physical and psychic superiority, combined with indifference to danger, probably based on inexperience.

concentrations in the region of Villers-Cotteret; the 4th and 28th U. S. Divisions, en route from the British front, were diverted to this point; the 2d, 3d, 26th and
42d were in that area, a force equivalent to 12 French divisions. To the XX Corps was allotted the critical part of the attack, to outflank the northeastern edge of the Foret de Retz, capture Chaudun and Vierzy, secure the plateau northeast of Hartennes and hold the southern outlet of the Ravine de Crise. The attack of the corps was made with divisions abreastist U. S., 1st Moroccan Division and
2d U. S. Division, in the order from north to south; the axis of attack was through DommiersChaudunVillemontoire. Marshal Foch approved the plan on 13
July. In order to insure secrecy, the concentration was to be completed in four days and the attack launched on the i8th.

The 1st U. S. Division. The ist Division was assigned to the XX Corps on i July, while in vicinity of Dammartin; it was entrucked and in position behind its zone of action on the 17th. The night march, to the line of departure, was made under extraordinary difficulties; a violent rainstorm turned the trails into a quagmire; the men were constantly slipping and falling into shell holes; the congestion toward the front was terrifictanks, trucks, artillery intermingled with the exhausted soldiers. 16 The rolling barrage started at 4:35 A. M. The division advanced with regiments abreast, regiments in column of battalions, in the order: 28th, 26th, i6th and i8th Infantry, from north to south, with the i5d French Division on the left, and the Moroccans on the right. The divisional artillery was reinforced by French guns, and supported by 48 French tanks, on a front of about 2,000 meters.

18 July. There was no artillery preparation; the Germans were taken by surprise. The first objective was reached about 5:30 A. M. and by 7:oo A. M. the
1st Brigade had seized part of the second objective. The German resistance began to stiffen; the wheat fields were dotted with machine guns, which were operated with reckless courage. The 2d Brigade was unable to advance, since the i53d French Division, on its left, made slow progress. The Missy-aux-Bois ravine proved to be a formidable obstacle. After desperate fighting the eastern slope of the ravine was finally reached about 10:30 A. M. Thereafter the advance was everywhere contested fiercely; the curious cave formation, in this vicinity, enabled enemy detachments to emerge and fire at the Americans from behind and slow down the attack. Such an incident took place in the sector of the 28th Infantry, which received fire from the vicinity of Mont d'Arcy; eventually 20
officers and several hundred men were taken from this cave. The left brigade was unable to reach its objective. In spite of this local check, the day had been successful; approximately 2,000 prisoners were taken and several batteries of artillery. At dark, the front line extended along the Missy Ravine, past Missy, to the final objective, one kilometer farther to the east and linked up with the Moroccans at Chaudun.

19 July. At 4:00 A. M., the next day, the attack was continued. The Germans had not been idle during the night; originally only one division, the 42d, had opposed the 1st U. S., during the day three other divisions, the i ith Bavarian,
34th and 28th Divisions were identified. The advance to the ParisSoissons road was very costly. Violent machine-gun and artillery fire from Ploisy stopped the
2d Brigade, after advancing less than one kilometer from the Missy Ravine. The
1st Brigade also suffered heavy casualties and barely reached the ravine at Chazelle. After reorganization, late in the afternoon, at 5:3o P. M., the division was able to renew the assault and reach the western edge of the Ploisy Ravine.

Severe hand-to-hand fighting continued throughout the night; the farm of Mt.

de Courmelles was captured, lost and recaptured, 17 and the fighting in the village of Ploisy was desperate. Casualties probably numbered 3,000, but the enemy losses were equally appalling and 35 officers and i,ooo men were captured;
20 field guns were taken at Ploisy and Chazelle.

20 July. The advance of the i53d French Division, as noted, had not kept pace with the 1st Division on the i8th or i9th. The strong point of Berzy-le-Sec was originally in the zone of action of this division. Orders for the 20th assigned Berzy to the 1st U. S. Division. After reorganization, during the night, the division renewed the attack on the 20th, but failed to take Berzy-le-Sec or to reach the Chateau-Thierry road. The 2d Brigade suffered serious casualties; the 1st Brigade, however, in conjunction with the Moroccans reached the vicinity of Bois Gerard, Visigneux, and Aconin Farm. The i53d French Division, on the left, and the Moroccan Division, on the right, were relieved by the 69th and
87th Divisions. The 2d U. S. Division was relieved by the French 58th Colonial Division. The 1st Division remained still on the linethe only one of the divisions that began the assault to remain unaided.

21 July. Berzy-le-Sec was the key point of the defense of the Chateau-Thierry
Soissons railroad; it was held by remnants of the German 6th, 34th, 42d and iith Bavarian Divisions and was reinforced during the night by the 46th German Division.

With the brigade commander and his staff in the first wave, the feeble echelons moved to the attack.

(Brig. Gen. B. B. Buck.) The 1st Brigade attacked at 4:45
AM, under cover of a rolling barrage, and reached the objectives on the height north of Buzancy; the 2d Brigade delayed its departure because the 69th French Division required an artillery preparation of three hours.18 The advance was made at 8:o and proved most successful; by 9:15 AM, Berzy.le.Sec was in American hands, with important captures in men and materiel. At nightfall, the line ran


from east of Berzy-le-Sec to the Chateau.Thierry road, south of the Sucrerie, to north of Visigneux. That night the exhausted division heard news of impending relief by the i5th Scottish Division.

22 July. As the 87th French Division had failed to take Buzancy no further progress was practicable; the day was devoted to organizing the defensive line; the 26th Infantry took the Sucrerie and filled a gap between the ist Brigade and the 28th Infantry. During the night 22-23 July, the division was relieved; about noon 23 July, trucks moved the remnants of the division to the Dammartin-en Coele area.

The heroic endurance of this division during five days of bitter fighting must be considered as a remarkable performance; none but the best disciplined and seasoned troops could have preserved their cohesion under the losses sustained.

All reserves were employed early on 21 July. It became necessary to use Engineers and form fresh reserves from elements of the trains and newly arrived replace.

ments. The casualties of the division amounted to 285 officers and 7,655 men killed, wounded or missing. They included 75 per cent of the infantry field officers and 6o per cent of company officers. On 20 July, the 26th Infantry was commanded by a captain of less than two years' service.'9 However, this gallant unit had accomplished its mission. The road and railroad south from Soissons was cut.

The German retreat from the Marne pocket was begun in haste. The division had advanced ii kilometers, against five enemy divisions; it had captured 125
officers, 3,375 men, 75 artillery field pieces, 300 machine guns, 2,500 rifles and large qualities of small arms and artillery ammunition.2
d. Smaller units in penetration. What about smaller units: the battalion, the company and platoon? What is their role in penetration?

In the attack on Cantigny,2' there is a pattern of parallel boundaries, nine companies of a single regiment fighting in corridors toward a limited objective.

At Soissons there was a front of four regiments abreast, battalion with two companies abreast, and each regiment in column of battalions: a modern phalanx
2900 yards wide and several hundred yards deep.22
An observer at Chaudun, in the zone of advance of the Moroccan Division, had a glimpse of this phalanx on the move:

ground along the Paris-Soissons road, until then occupied only by some of our batteries and now deserted, save for their personnel, suddenly became alive with men. Under the torn boughs of the poplars and marching toward the southeast appeared a strong force of infantry. The composition of this force was not known to the observer and he was not aware of the impending attack. Field glasses were leveled in its direction to discover its identity. Meanwhile, more of the infantry appeared and it was seen that the men were in attack formation, except that they were moving by the flank. Their pace was slow and impressiveabout that at which a barrage rolls. The faces of the infantry, in the shadow of the steel helmets, appeared black, and a French officer exclaimed, 'They are the tirailleurs!', referring to the Algerian regiment of the Moroccan Division on the right of the ist Division. But further inspection showed they were not tirailleurs. They were the remnants of available reserves of the 1st Division after three days of terrific battle. On the breast of each man was the unmistakable box respirator, and the broad American bayonets flashed in the hot July sun. The wide column slowly wound down the grassy ravine toward the Crise. It was probably somewhat over a kilometer in length and three hundred meters wide.

"Our leading waves now appeared approaching the crest of the ridge above Berzy-le-Sec, following the barrage. Each individual soldier in the attack was distinctly visible against the grassy hillsides. The whole mass was proceeding with the utmost regularity and precision. As the leading elements reached the crest of the ridge, a single battery of enemy 150-mm. howitzers opened fire with time shell, obviously with observed fire on the target. This battery was followed almost at once by many other batteries of 150-mm. and 105-mm. howitzers, all firing time shell. The accuracy of preparation of this fire was such that practically no adjust.

ment was required, and, almost immediately, our infantry was shrouded in smoke and dust. Great gaps were left in the ranks as the shells crashed among them.

Nevertheless, the advance continued in the most orderly way. It was noticed that the enemy's artillery diminished its range as our infantry advanced.

"Many of our infantry passed out of sight over the ridge, accompanied by the devastating fire of the enemy's artillery. Men struck by the enemy's fire either disappeared or ran aimlessly about and toppled over.

"Then began to be heard also the rattle of the enemy's machine guns. The attack had met the resistance of a strong position occupied in great force by the enemy.

It could not be taken at this time by our worn soldiers, and, after this advance, they could go no farther. The thin lines lay down in shell holes, while long files of wounded hobbled painfully back.

"Then appeared a sight which at first seemed inexplicable. Individual men and groups of twos and threes began to wander about all over the field. They were the unit leaders, reorganizing their groups against counterattack.

"Thus the afternoon passed and night fell."28
When boundaries are fixed, as they were then and now, the smaller unit goes forward to fight; as an interior unit it would appear that there will be little opportunity for Napoleonic concepts and planning, except to carry fire forward;
that is particularly true of the attack on fortified positions. And yet, once out into the opening, the hostile shell pierced and elbow room available, maneuver possibilities present themselves in all echelons. Note the action of the o6th U. S.

Infantry in an envelopment against St. Juvin, 14 October 1918, and that of Company C, iod U.S. Infantry in the attack on Hill 190, 20 July 1918.24 A number of very interesting situations developed in the zone of action of one of the regiments at Soissons, the 28th U. S. Infantry:25
(i) The capture of St. Amand Farm. The assault companies moved forward to the attack at : 35 AM and soon closed on the barrage. By : o the 3d Battalion reached the first objective, the road running northeast from Dommiers.

The assault companies continued their advance, following the barrage closely, until they reached a position about 200 meters west of the Raperie and the enemy's line of resistance. At this point, they met with heavy rifle and machine-gun fire, most of it coming from St. Amand Farm, which pinned them to the ground. On account of the level ground, the support platoons of both companies were forced to take cover from the enemy fire being directed at the assault lines. Something had to be done quickly to relieve this situation, as the barrage would stop only
15 minutes in front of the first objective. The support companies were not within supporting distance at this time, and the only unit which was available for maneuver was the scout platoon of the battalion. This platoon was composed of one lieutenant and 35 enlisted men. The men were all expert shots and had been selected on account of their good shooting ability and former bravery in action. The scout lieutenant was ordered to attack the Raperie with his platoon.

Two squads of the platoon opened fire on it from the front, and the other two squads were maneuvered to a position on the flank from which enfilade fire could be delivered on it. As soon as fire was opened by the squads on the left flank, the two in front, led by the lieutenant, charged the enemy. One platoon of Company H, led by its lieutenant, joined this charge. Both lieutenants were severely wounded as they were about to close with the enemy, but the men, inspired by their leaders, continued the charge and succeeded in capturing the position. Five heavy machine guns and about ioo prisoners were captured in and around this strong point. The enemy's casualties had been very heavy on account of the accurate shooting of our men.

The capture of the strong point lessened the fire on our assault companies, and the advance was continued, the men firing from the shoulder as they moved forward in the high wheat.

(2) The Caves of Mont d'Arly. The 3d Battalion then took over the front line of the regiment at about 4:oo i'. M. The 2d Battalion went into a support position on the eastern edge of the Missy.aux-Bois Ravine, just east of Breuil.

While the fighting was going on in the Missy.aux-Bois Ravine, it was discovered that great numbers of the enemy were emerging from a large cave in the vicinity of le Mont d'Arly and that they were firing on our troops from the rear. This cave had not been captured by the troops that had previously attacked and captured le Mont d'Arly. The reserve company, which had been left on the western edge of the Missy-aux-Bois Ravine, attacked the enemy at once and took them on the flank. The Germans were driven back in the cave, and they refused to surrender.

It was impossible to bomb them out as the entrance was covered with machine guns from within. This made it necessary to lay siege to the entrance. The commander of the enemy garrison held out until about 4:oo p. M., when he came out under cover of a white flag and surrendered his entire force, consisting of twenty officers, including a commandant, and between three and four hundred men.

Several horses, officers' mounts fully equipped, a great number of machine guns and trench mortars were also captured in this cave.

() Saconin-et-Breuil. The Missy Ravine presented a serious obstacledeep, with a marshy bottom and about goo yards wide; the strong defensive possibilities are obvious; the area was studded with enemy field guns and machine guns. Five of the French accompanying tanks were disabled by direct fire of -mm. guns located in the ravine. When the Americans reached the bottom of the ravine, they were stopped by direct enfilading fire from Breuil. Major Huebner directed Companies G and H on Breuil, along the east slope of the ravine; these units soon came under heavy fire from le Mont d'ArIy and slowed down; casualties amounted to 50 per cent. Major Tack, the commander of the 3d Battalion, in rear, realized the gravity of the situation and brought his fresh units into the action.

() Berzy-le-Sec. On the fourth day of the attack, 21 July, the shattered remnants of the gallant 28th Infantry made their last and successful attack on Berzy-le.Sec. The regiment was disposed with the 1st and 2d Battalions, in line;
the 8d Battalion in support; a sadly depleted battalion of the i8th Infantry took its place, in line with the 2d Battalion.

The regiment resorted to maneuver in a double envelopment: at 8:3o A. M.

the first battalion moved around the north of the town, the second around the south; the Germans evacuated the position.

Our most reliable authority very wisely remarks: ".

.

. a sharp distinction between the various classes of offensive situations and the methods employed cannot always be made. Each class may temporarily present aspects which are characteristic of the others."
This very conservative observation applies to the transition from penetration to break throughthey are two of a kind: the difference is one of relative size, importance and intensity. Cantigny27 represents a penetration while Meggido28
is a breakthrough. Finally, military terminology2a is by no means as clear-cut as the profession fondly believes it to be: penetration is a preparatory action that may (or may not) lead to a breakthrough
25. THE BREAKTHROUGH, a. General considerations. Principles. The opening phases of the World War, in the period August-September 1914, are characteristic of a war of movement. The hectic character of these engagements presents a sharp contrast with the sudden paralysis that fell over these fronts in the years from 1915
to 1918a period known as "stabilization."
It seemed scarcely possible that an extended front such as this could ever have developed in the short space of time between August and November 1914. In these days of motorization and mechanization, with "speed, mobility, maneuver"
as key-words, it seems equally impossible that these lines should have become stationary. How did this come about? The enormous staying power of automatic defensive weapons, combined with field fortifications, made the frontal attack expensive. This lesson might have been observed in all previous wars, particularly our own Civil War.

The strategic and tactical solution to be attempted was a foregone conclusion:
the envelopment, the flank maneuver, the turning movement.

Each opponent tried it. There began a series of attempts to envelop the enemy, who, in turn, extended his flanks, to meet and check this threaton the Oise, Picardy, the Artois, and Flanders.

The only limits to this endless extension seemed an exhaustion in man power or an insurmountable natural obstaclethe sea. Both elements came into play,

and by December 1914 the opposing armies had dug in, in that incredible belt of trenches which stretched from the Channel to the Swiss border.

On the West Front, the story of the years from 1914 to igiS is one of repeated desperate attempts to break the deadlock of trench warfare through the only remaining tactical methods of "penetration" or "breakthrough". Four conspicu ous examples of "breakthrough operations" may show the characteristic form of this operation:
(i) The breakthrough at Gorlice-Tarnow, May igi5: a success.

(2) The second battle of the Aisne, April igi: a failure.

() The battle of Verdun, February 1916: a hybrid.

() The tank attack at Cambrai, November igi: a modern solution.

From this brief evaluation of "success" or "failure," it is apparent that this paragraph represents an analysis of "cause and effect?"3
At first glance, it seems pointless to revive incidents of "stabilization," which is now generally regarded as an abnormality. However, "breakthrough" operations are not exclusive phenomena of stabilized fronts; they have appeared, as "local penetrations," in open warfare situations, sometimes within the framework of a single battle.

At any rate, our current military texts still accept "penetration" and "break.

through" as normal military possibilities.

The question immediately presents itself: "What principles are involved in this type of operationthe breakthrough?" These principles are listed in Plate 6o.

The whole method and procedure, in a breakthrough operation, is clearly described in these paragraphs.

It is equally obvious that these complex factors can be reduced to a list of
"command principles," shown in the right column.

From this point on the analysis Consists of the relatively simple task of tracing and checking the selected operations against this list of command principles with a view to determine to what extent they were applied. The record of this investigation should explain success or failure, as the case may be.

b. The breakthrough of GorliceTarnow, May 1915. The Eastern Front held jointly by German and Austrian forces was defended by one and three.fourths million Russians and had the enormous extent of over 8oo miles. In the spring of 1915, the situation was generally unfavorable for the Central Powers. On the Austrian front, the Russians had practically broken through the Carpathians and constituted an immediate, serious menace to Hungary. The problem of GHQ
was to relieve the intolerable pressure in this area. In view of the stabilization that had set in, the operation of course had to take the form of a "breakthrough."
Where, on this enormous front, approximately equivalent to the distance from New York to Chicago, was the point of breakthrough and the reasons for its selection?

An advance from East Prussia in the north could hardly affect the Russians on the Carpathian front.

Frontal pressure against the face of the great salient seemed fruitless, leading only to a step-by.step withdrawal toward the east.

A breakthrough on the flank of the Carpathian front in the south, however, might remove the threat to Hungary. GHQ consequently decided on a break.

through on the front: GorliceTarnow.
