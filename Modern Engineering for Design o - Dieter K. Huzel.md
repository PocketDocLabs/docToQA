F O R E W O R D

When Dave Huang and I set out to write the first edition of this book, we were motivated, among other things, by our observation that no textbook was available that we could hand to a newly hired young engineer and say: "Here, study this and then we will talk about your specific assignments in our rocket engine business". Instead, as supervisors, we and our lead engineers had to spend many hours explaining what actually should have been documented, to serve as an introduction, but also as a reference to provide answers to letter questions. Thus we went to work.

I was fortunate to have in Dave a coauthor of such superior abilities. In his "Author's Guide," a commercial publisher observes (after discussing the problems with multiple authorships): "(We hope)
you'll still be speaking to one another after the book has been published." I am happy to say that we,
(Dave now holds a high government position in the Republic of China, (Taiwan)), do indeed still speak to each other.

A few years ago, Martin Summerfield, President of the Princeton Combustion Research Laboratories, and then Editor-in-Chief of the Progress in Astro nautics and Aeronautics technical-monograph series of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) suggested that our book should be re-issued, but only after an update of all areas where technology has seen major advances since publication of the first edition. Fortunately, the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International agreed to sponsor the needed effort. A team of specialized staff members was formed and began the work. The results are before you.

In the "Commentary" column of AIAA's March
1988 Aerospace America magazine, J.R. Thompson, NASA Deputy Administrator, emphasizes the need to
"take advantage of this nation's substantial Shuttle investment.., by adapting available hardware as it proves itself in service." Although this comment was contained in a discussion of the Advanced Launch System (ALS), it can be readily applied to any other future propulsion system, perhaps with the addition of "and available know-how, practices, and ex periences." It is hoped that this book will contribute to all efforts responsive to the quoted exhortation.

Reliable rocket-engine systems do not come a b o u t b y  happenstance. They are the result of the work of a dedicated team of professionals--engi neers, materials specialists, production workers, and numerous other disciplines. These skilled people are found not only in the plants of major rocket-engine producers, such as Rocketdyne, Aerojet, and Pratt &
Whitney, or in specialized centers of NASA and the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, but also and equally important-- in the plants of the "suppliers,"
the hundreds of smaller companies that produce many of a rocket engine's highly specialized parts. It is the dedication, skill, and pride of workmanship of these people that made possible this nation's many space successes--manned or unmanned. Future pro jects depend on them just as much. For them too, this book is intended.

Special emphasis has been placed here on engine flight applications to stimulate engine systems and subsystem designers to think in these terms f rom the outset. In addition to filling the needs of the young engineer entering the rocket-propulsion field and practicing designer seeking wider knowledge, we always intended "Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines" as a textbook, with specific consideration of the teacher without industry experience. I hope it will also stimulate those desiring to specialize in a rocket engine subsystem by supplying adequate information to enable them to benefit fully from the specialized literature.

Wernher von Braun, then Director of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center graciously provided the forward for the first edition of this book, which was published in restricted form in 1967 by the NASA Office of Technology Utilization (SP-125). Because of the foreward's significance I quote it here"

"Success in space demands perfection. Many of the brilliant achievements made in this vast, austere environment seem almost miraculous. Behind each apparent miracle, however, stands the flawless performance of numerous highly complex systems. All are important. The failure of only one portion of a launch vehicle or spacecraft may cause failure of an entire mission. But the first to feel this awesome imperative for perfection are the propulsion systems, especially the engines. Unless they operate flawlessly first, none of the other systems will get a chance to perform in space."

"Perfection begins in the design of space hardware. This book emphasizes quality and reliability in the design of propulsion and engine systems. It draws deeply from the vast know-how and experience which have been the essence of several well-designed, reliable systems of the past and present. And, with a thoroughness and com pleteness not previously available, it tells how the present high state of reliability, gained through years of research and testing, can be maintained, and perhaps improved, in engines of the future."

"As man ventures deeper into space to explore the planets, the search for perfection in the de sign of propulsion systems will continue. This book will aid materially in achieving this goal."

PREFACE

Over the quarter-century since publication of the original text of this book, astronauts have landed on the Moon and deep-space probes have visited all of the planets of our solar system. All of these under takings depended entirely on rocket power. So will future space projects of many kinds, such as the Space Station Freedom, communications and explo ration satellites, space ferries and shuttles, space probes, and, in the more distant future, Moon settlements.

Throughout the decades since Robert Goddard made his first l p-rocket launching in 1926, these thrust-producing devices, both turbopump-fed and pressure-fed, have assumed various shapes, sizes, con figurations, and "cycles," depending on application, chosen thrust level, propellant type, and several other, often special, factors. One aspect has not changed: the basic physical and design principles.

In the context of practical design experience, this book introduces the reader to these basic principles;
but more to the purpose, it supplies the bridge for the student and the young engineer from rocket propulsion fundamentals (otherwise well covered in the literature) to actual rocket-engine design and development work as done in industry (very little, if at all, covered in the literature). The book empha sizes realistic application of rocket propulsion theories, and this should help avoid, or at least reduce, time- and money-consuming errors and dis appointments. In so doing, it consolidates numerous closely related subjects, hitherto often treated sepa rately, bringing them up to date at the same time.

This book was written "on the job" for use by advanced students and engineers active in all phases of engine systems design, development, and appli cation, in industry and government agencies. It pre sents sufficient detail to familiarize and educate those responsible for various aspects of liquid-propellant rocketry, including engine systems design, engine development,  and flight-vehicle application. It should enable the rocket engineer independently to make preliminary detail designs for complete or par tial engine systems and to understand and judge the problems, limitations, and "facts of life" of the various subsystems making up a complete engine sys tem. It also aims to educate those ultimately inter ested in specialized subsystems and component design (thrust chamber, turbopump, control valves, etc.) about their own as well as neighboring sub systems and about the complete engine system. This should enable the beginner to prepare realistic analytical calculations and design layouts with a long head-start toward the final specialized design for subsystem production release.

This book addresses the young in a special way. Many of us who contributed to past projects are now retired or are about to retire. Some experienced hands have passed away. It is immensely important that the skills, experience, and know-how of this earlier generation be preserved and passed on to a younger generation--clearly, completely, and effec tively. Losses would be costly. There must not be a gap. The managers of the many companies that form the rocket-engine industry and the pertinent government agencies are quite aware of this danger, and are employing various "in-house" programs to meet it.

This book makes a valuable contribution to that goal. The original authors stood among the forefront of design and development teams of larger propul sion systems, and Dieter Huzel spent several years in
"long-life technology" work. David Huang for many years directed advanced rocket-engine design and development.

I am confident that the commendable efforts of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astro nautics to update, enlarge, and publish this book and to make it available to the field will greatly help to preserve and advance U.S.rocket-engine technology.

Introduction To Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines

Since World War II, rocket jet-propulsion has evolved design, fabrication, development, and qualification from a rudimentary science to a refined engineering testing. The reusable SSME (see Fig. 1-2) operates art. Today, a select number of aerospace companies with liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen propellants, and in the U.S. and abroad produce a large number of delivers a vacuum thrust of 470,000 lb using a sophisticated liquid-propellant rocket-engine power chamber pressure of 3028 psia with a propulsion plants capable of propelling scientific, commercial, system weight of 6862 lb. and military vehicles to low and high Earth orbit and A similar evolut ionary per iod at Aerojet to the planets in our solar system. Typical of the TechSystems of GenCorp has produced a highly postwar evolution of liquid-propellant rocket power successful line of storable liquid-propellant rocket plants has been the family tree of Rocketdyne engines for the Air Force's Titan series of vehicles. engines deriving from the Navaho and Redstone The first-stage rocket engine (LR87-AJ-11) for the precursor engines of the early 1950s depicted in Fig. Titan III combines two identical 220,000-1b sea-level

Eight of these engine models have been used in thrust engines attached to a steel frame which NASA, U.S. Air Force, and commercial launches for mounts onto the launch vehicle as depicted in Fig. 1 missions ranging from near-Earth orbit to manned 3. The storable nature of the propellants provides lunar missions. Approximately  3300 engine the Titan III with enhanced launch readiness for production units have been delivered since 1956 to accomplishing Air Force missions. A lower-thrust power Redstone, Jupiter, Thor, Delta, Atlas, Saturn, engine, the LR91-AJ-11, with an altitude thrust of and Shuttle systems for these missions. Three of 100,000 lb, provides second-stage propulsion power these engines remain in production today: the RS-27 for the Titan III C vehicle. The propellants for both used for the Delta vehicle, the MA-5 used for the the LR87-AJ-11 and the LR91-AJ-11 are fed to the Atlas vehicle, and the Space Shuttle Main Engine engine by a powerful set of turbopumps. A set of two

DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES stage thrust of 16,000 lb. The engines are designed for multiple zero-gravity restarts and give the upper stage vehicle the ability to reach higher orbits, modify the existing orbit, or rendezvous with other space vehicles. The Titan III C vehicle, assembled by Martin Marietta Corp., had flown 136 missions for the U.S. Air Force through March 1982. The highly reliable high-performance engines and vehicle ensure their combined use well into the 1990s.

The two Titan III E lower stages have b e e n  used to place in orbit General Dynamics' cryogenic Centaur upper-stage vehicle. The Centaur vehicle is powered by the RL-10, a cryogenic liquid propellant
(liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen) upper-stage rocket engine developed by Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies. The RL-10 was initially developed in the period 1959-1963 and through 1974
had seen more than 10,000 firings. The engine is capable of self-conditioning in orbit with subsequent restarts. Through a series of ground-directed engine firings it has been used to propel the Centaur and such cargo as the Viking Spacecraft to Mars and the Voyager Spacecraft to Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Through 1986, 172 engines had been fired in space, accumulating 278 space firings and 20+ hours of run time in space. Product improvement of the original RL-10 has led to the highly reliable RL-10-3-3-A (Fig.
1-4) and to a series of RL-10 derivative designs of greater sophistication.

These are but a few examples of the liquid propellant rocket engines in current use and their continued application in gaining access to the inner frontiers of our solar system. It is the purpose of this book to introduce the reader to the design of the liquid-propellant rocket engine components that so effectively convert the chemical energy of suitable liquids into propulsive power, and to the design principles that are used to assemble these sub assemblies into efficient, reliable, and cost-effective liquid-propellant rocket engine systems.

1.1 BASIC ELEMENTS OF A LIQUID P R O P E ~ T  ROCKET ENGINE

Seven major subsystems comprise a liquid propellant rocket engine system: thrust-chamber assembly, propellant feed system, turbine-drive system (gas generator, preburner, etc.), propellant control system, electric and pneumatic controller systems, thrust-vector  control (TVC) system, interconnect components and mounts. Six of these
(except for the TVC system) are depicted in Fig. 1-5
for the RL-10-3-3-A engine.

The thrust-chamber assembly generates power by combusting liquid propellants raised to the required

combustion pressure by the propellant feed system. The thrust chamber houses the main injector; it atomizes, mixes, ignites, and ultimately promotes the complete combustion of the liquid propellants. The combustion products are discharged through a converging-diverging nozzle to achieve high gas velocities and thrust. Depending on the application and simplicity desired, the propellant feed system will consist of propel lant  tanks, lines, and turbopumps; propellant turbopumps and lines; and in the case of a pressure-fed engine system, simple propellant tanks and lines.

The turbines are (in most cases) driven by energetic high-temperature gases produced in gas generators, preburners, heat exchangers heated by the main thrust-chamber combustion products, or gases tapped directly from the main combustion chamber. Occasionally low-power turbines are driven hydraulically by high-pressure propellants in the system.

In each of the three cases above, a set of propellant valves in the propellant-control system meters the two propellants flowing to the injector controlling both total amount and relative amount. Total amount is used in thrust control while the relative amount is used in control of propellant mixture ratio. The valves also perform the task of starting and shutting down the engine through proper sequencing and regulation of propellant flowrates.

These final control elements (valves) are electrically or pneumatically controlled. The con trollers receive command signals from the vehicle or previously stored electric commands in the con troller memory to effect valve control during engine operation (to yield desired thrust and mixture-ratio variation or propellant consumption during flight). The TVC system effects directional changes of the vehicle.

Depending on the method of propellant feed, there are two basic types of liquid-propellant rocket engines: those having propellants directly fed from pressurized tanks to the thrust chamber and those having the propellants fed to the thrust chamber by a set of turbopumps. In the first case, the tank pressures may typically be a few hundred pounds per square inch. In the second instance, the propellants are supplied from the tanks to the inlets of tur bopumps at relatively low pressures, typically 30 to
100 psig. The turbopumps then raise these inlet pressures to high levels, which in modern engines like the SSME may reach 8,000 psig or more. In the case of the SSME, low-pressure propellant pumps provide an intermediate pumping stage between tank

DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES and main turbopumps.  Because of tank weight considerations,  pressure feed will be limited to propulsion-system sizes that deliver relatively low stage velocity increments. Many modern liquid propel lant  rocket  engines use tu rbopump feed because it lowers the total weight of inert parts per stage.

A schematic diagram of a turbopump-fed system, which uses heated helium for tank pressurization, is shown in Fig. 1-6. The major components of both the pressure-fed and pump-fed systems are called out in the figure. Subsequent chapters of this book discuss in detail each of these components and the design philosophies for them.

Although the two engine types differ significantly in a number  of respects, they have one major c o m p o n e n t  in common:  the thrust chamber . Because of the importance of understanding the chemical and gas-dynamic processes in the thrust chamber,  the following sections summarize  the equations that govern these processes, and point out the significance of them to achieving opt imum engine performance.

1.2 GENERATION OF THRUST

The thrust of a rocket is the reaction experienced by its structure due to the ejection of high-velocity mat te r - - the  same phenomenon  that makes a gun recoil. In the latter case the forward momentum
(mass x velocity) of the bullet and the "powder charge" equals the rearward momentum (recoil) of the gun proper.

All self-propelled means of transportation within a liquid or gaseous medium obtain driving force on the basis of exchange of momentum. Ship propellers, airplane propellers, water wheels, oars, and the like generate forward "push" at the expense of the mo mentum of water or air masses accelerated rearward. Rocket propulsion differs from these devices only in the relative magnitude of the accelerated masses and the velocities. While, hitherto, large masses were thrown back at low velocities, in rocket propulsion only relatively small masses of gas are used, which are carried within the vehicle and ejected at a very high velocity.

The efflux of hot gas from a rocket vehicle can basically be regarded as the ejection of small masses such as Am (the molecules of gas) at a high relative velocity Ve with respect to the vehicle, which has a mass my and is moving at the velocity u. The force, the momentum, and the velocity are vector quan tities. Consider a simplified system where only one particle Am is being ejected at any one time. (The discussion through Eq. 1-8 emulates G.P. Sutton in his Rocket Propulsion Elements, 5th Ed., Wiley, New York 1986.) The net momentum of this system M is  M = m v u = kan(u - Ve) (1-1)

Differentiating with respect to time yields dM/dt
- 0 (no external momentum change). The d(Am)/dt approaches -dm/dt for a continuously flowing gas. This equals the rate of decrease of the vehicle mass my. The exhaust velocity Ve is constant and thus its

time derivative is equal to 0. and approaches 0 as its limit.

Also, Am is very small Thus one obta insm du dm mv d--t- = - dt ve (1-2)

The left-hand term equals the net force (Nf) acting on the fluid element which when  integrated over the control surface as in Fig. 1-6 b e c o m e s m d m  w Nf = - - ~  v e = mv e = g v e (1-3)

This net force obtains for any true rocket engine in a vacuum. It assumes a uniform exhaust  velocity that does not vary across the area of the jet. The mihus sign in Eq. (1-2) indicates a decrease in the mass of the vehicle or reflects the velocity Ve being opposite in direction to the net force. The propellant mass flow rate fn is used  ins tead o f - d m / d t  in the remainder of the book, and the weight flow rate w, usually a measured quantity, when  divided by the acceleration of gravity g, again represents mass flow rate. The preceding  equa t ion  shows that, in a vacuum, the force is proport ional  to the propellant flow rate and exhaust velocity.

The pressure of the env i ronmen tma i r  ambient pressure for a rocket in f l ight--has an influence on the magnitude of the net force. Figure 1-7 shows schematically the external pressure acting uniformly on the outer surface of a rocket chamber  and the gas pressures  on the inside of a typical chemical  or nuclear  rocket  engine.  The size of the arrows indicates the relative magn i tude  of the pressure forces. The axial net force can be determined by integrating all the pressures acting on areas that can be projected on a plane normal to the nozzle axis. The forces acting radially outward are appreciable but do not contribute to the net axial force, because the rocket is axially symmetrical.

By inspection it can be seen (and this can be proven) that at the exit area Ae of the engine's gas exhaust  there is an unba lance  of the external environmental  or a tmospher ic  pressure Pa and the local pressure Pe of the hot gas jet at the exit plane of the nozzle. For a rocket  engine flying in a h o m o g e n e o u s  a t m o s p h e r e  (neglect ing local ized boundary-layer effects), the net axial force through integration of all pressures  in the control volume takes the following form:

I O

Nr = Pt dA ---- AP + AePa = w V (1-4)
Arc g

From this equation it follows that the net external axial force acting on the rocket will be as follows:

W F =--V + &(P~- P,) (1-5)

g

This external  f o r c e - - t h e  thrust  act ing on the veh i c l emcombines  two terms: m o m e n t u m  thrust
(product of the propel lant  mass flow rate and the exhaust velocity relative to the vehicle) and pressure thrust (product  of the cross-sectional area of the exhaust  jet leaving the vehicle and the difference between the exhaust pressure and the fluid pressure). For exhaust pressure less than the surrounding fluid pressure,  pressure thrust  will be negative. This condition gives a lower thrust and is undesirable.

When the fluid p ressure  equals the exhaust pressure, the pressure thrust term becomes zero, and

D E S I G N  OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES the thrust can be expressed a s  F = :  Ve (1-63

This condition gives a maximum thrust (for a given atmospheric pressure)  for a given propellant  and chamber  pressure.  The rocket  nozzle design that permits expansion of the propellant products to the same pressure of the surrounding fluid has what is called optimum expansion ratio.

Equation (1-5) shows that the thrust of a rocket is independent  of flight velocity. Because changes in the fluid pressure affect the pressure thrust, the rocket thrust rises with increasing altitude. The change in pressure thrust with altitude can amount to 10 to 30%
of the overall thrust. Figure 1-8 shows the variation of thrust and specific impulse with altitude for a typical rocket engine.

Equation (1-5) is often expressed as follows:

xv F = c - -  (1-7)

g where  c is defined as the effective exhaust velocity
(ft/s) and compr i ses  c = V e + Ae(Pe -- p~)(g/XV) (1-8)

The effective exhaust  velocity is not the actual gas velocity except when  Pe = Pa where c becomes equal to Ve. As explained with Eq. (1-5), the presence of a term Ae(Pe - Pa) (g/W) indicates that optimum v e is not optimum for that altitude of operation.

Sample Calculation 1-1

The following data describe a liquid-propellant rocket engine: thrust F = 100,000 lb at sea level;
propellant consumpt ion rate W = 369.3 lb/s; thrust chamber  exit area Ae = 760.8 in.2; gas exit average static pressure Pe = 10.7 psia; ambient pressure Pa =
14.7 psia (sea level); gravitational constant g = 32.2
ft/s 2. The exit pressure across the exit of a nozzle has a sinusoidal profile, with the value at the wall being approximately twice the average and the value at the axis of the nozzle being of the order of 10% of the wall pressure. The average exit pressure Pe then takes

the place of the one-d imens iona l  exit pressure required by Eq. (1-5).

P r o b l e m

From the equation above, determine (a) gas exhaust velocity, (b) engine thrust in vacuum, and (c) the effective exhaust  velocities at sea level and in vacuum.

Solution 1-1

(a)  From Eq. (1-5) the gas exhaust velocity will be as follows:

V e  = [F-Ae(Pe-Pa)](g/W)
= [100,000-760.8(10.7-14.7)](32.2/369.3)
= 9040 ft/s

Although the average exit pressure (10.7 psia) is below the sea-level ambient pressure (14.7 psia), no separation of the flow will occur in this nozzle (an undesirable phenomena  associated with erratic side loads). Separation will occur in a nozzle when the wall pressure  runs some 25-35% of the ambient pressure,  this value varying with propellant  com bination and nozzle exit flow angle. In the subject example, the wall pressure will be approximately 21.4
psia (2 x 10.7), a value considerably larger than sea level ambient  pressure. Therefore, there should be no concern  about  nozzle flow separat ion at this point.

(b )  Inspection of Eq. (1-5) will show that the differ ence in thrust between vacuum and sea level equals AePa. This thrust increase AePa is realized gradually as the rocket ascends, in two distinct steps, first by reduction of the negative thrust term Ae(Pe-Pa) to zero. This will occur when Pe = pa-- that  is, when the rising vehicle reaches an altitude where  Pa = 10.7
ps ia- - in  this specific case, the ideal expansion! As the vehicle  cont inues  to ascend and eventual ly reaches vacuum where  Pa = 0, the increase of the positive term Ae(Pe-Pa) raises the thrust level further. The combined effect of the two steps simply elim inates Ae-Pa. Thus we obtain engine thrust in space:

F = 100,000 + 760.8 x 14.7 = 111,183.8 lb

(c) Equation (1-8) then yields the effective exhaust velocity at sea level:

c = ve+Ae(Pe-Pa)(g/W)
= 9040+760.8 x (10.7- 14.7) x (32.2/369.3)
= 8772 ft/s and in vacuum:

= ve+AePe(g/W)
= 9040+760.8 x 10.7 x (32.2/369.3)
= 9750 ft/s

1.3 GAS-FLOW PROCESSES IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER AND NOZZLE

Since the analytical treatment of compressible fluids flowing through cylindrical ducts and nozzles can be found in standard aerodynamic and thermodynamic textbooks, no attempt will be made here to derive basic equa t ions  govern ing  gas flows. Rather, significant applications of equations used in actual rocket design will be presented. The parameters and terms applicable to gas flows in a liquid-propellant rocket thrust chamber  are shown in Fig. 1-9 and Table 1-1. These parameters serve to define the characteristics of gas flow at various points within the thrust chamber.  Gas-flow calculations for rocket thrust-chamber design usually assume the following ideal conditions:

 Homogeneous  gas composition.
 Perfect gas.
 No heat transfer through the motor walls in ei ther direction (i.e., adiabatic processes). If no in crease in entropy occurs, i.e., if the process is considered reversible, it is called an isentropic process.

 No friction.
 Steady flow rate.
 One-dimensional  flow (all gas molecules move on parallel lines).
 Velocity uniformity across any section normal to chamber axis.
 Chemical equi l ibr ium established within the combustion chamber and remaining constant in the nozzle.

Gas Flow Through Liquid-Propel lant  Rocket C o m b u s t i o n  Chambers

A l iquid-rocket  combus t ion  chamber  conver ts propellants into high-temperature, high-pressure gas through combustion, which releases the chemical energy of the propellant, resulting in an increase in internal energy of the gas. Combustion chambers have been generally of tubular  construction, as shown in Fig. 1-9. The liquid propellants are injected at the injection plane with a small axial velocity which is assumed to be zero in gas-flow calculations. The combustion process proceeds throughout the length of the chamber  and is expected to be completed at the nozzle entrance. Heat liberated between injection plane and nozzle inlet increases the specific volume of the gas. To satisfy the conditions of constant mass flow, the gas must be ac celerated toward the nozzle inlet with some drop of pressure. In brief, the following takes place.

The gas-flow process within the combust ion chamber, that is, within the volume upstream of the nozzle entrance, is not entirely isentropic but rather is a partly irreversible, adiabatic expansion. Although the stagnation temperature, or total temperature, remains constant, the stagnation pressure, or total pressure, will decrease. This causes permanent energy losses, which are a function of the gas properties as expressed by and of the nozzle contraction area ratio E c (Ac/At). Wherever the acceleration of gases is largely affected by expansion due to heat release, rather than by a change of area, as in a nozzle, the stated losses occur. The greater the contribution of the nozzle to overall thrust, the more efficient will be the gas acceleration. Conversely, with no nozzle at tached,  the losses are maximum.  The great importance of ec to the thrust-chamber design be comes apparent.  It will be discussed further in Chapter 4.

Neglecting the flow velocity at the injecting end--i .e. ,  assuming Vinj=0 and (Pc)inj=Pinjmthe total pressure ratio (Pc)inj/(Pc)ns can also be expressed in terms of flow Mach number  M i at the nozzle inlet and of the specific heat ratio T:

(Pc)mj/(Pc)ns = (1 +'yM2)/ 1 + " y -  1M~2 (1-14)

For the reasons mentioned above, it is desirable that the Mach number  at the nozzle entrance be small. A thrust chamber with a contraction area ratio of Ac/Ai = 2 will typically have a value of Mi=0.31( 7
= 1.2). For the static pressure ratio, the expression simplifies to- Pinj/Pi = 1 + "yM~ 2 (1-15)

Gas Flow Through  Rocket  Nozzles

The prime function of a rocket nozzle is to convert efficiently the enthalpy of the combustion gases into kinetic energy and thus create high exhaust velocity of the gas. The nozzle is the most efficient device for accelerating gases to supersonic velocities. Rocket nozzles are convent ional ly  of the converging diverging De Laval type, with the cross-sectional area decreasing to a minimum at the throat and then increasing to the exit area, as shown in Fig. 1-9. The flow velocity through a nozzle increases to sonic velocity at the throat and then increases further su personically in the diverging section.

In practice, for one-dimensional  isentropic expansion, (ODE) calculations, it is assumed that the gas flow through the nozzle will be an isentropic expansion, and that both the total temperature and the total pressure will remain constant throughout the nozzle. The pressure ratio pt/(Pc)ns between the throat and chamber is called the cr i t ical  pressure ratio and is solely a function of specific heat ratio:

pt/(Pc)ns= [2/7+ 1 )]7/(7-1 ) (1-16)

The static pressure Pt at a nozzle throat with sonic flow, where the maximum weight flow per unit



INTRODUCTION 9

area occurs, is defined as crit ical pressure. The velocity of sound is equal to the velocity of propagation of a pressure wave within a medium. It is therefore impossible for a pressure disturbance downstream of the nozzle throat to influence the flow at the throat or upstream of the throat, provided that this disturbance will not create a higher throat pres sure than the critical pressure.

It is one of the characteristic features of an attached diverging or De Laval nozzle, however, that sonic velocity in the nozzle throat is maintained even if the back pressure (ambient pressure) at the nozzle exit is greater than the pressure required at the throat for sonic velocity. As a result, a pressure adjustment (recovery) must take place between the throat and the nozzle exit (ambient pressure). This adjustment may take place through subsonic deceleration (isentropic) or by way of non-isentropic discontinuities called shock waves, or a combination of both. Figure 1-11a presents several of the possible conditions that may occur in an overexpanded nozzle. The situations shown represent cases of an over-expanded nozzle.

In short, pressures lower than ambient may be present in a supersonic nozzle. The higher ambient pressure cannot advance upstream within the nozzle, since the gases are flowing with supersonic velocity. An exception to this is in the region of the flow along the nozzle walls, where, due to friction, a boundary layer of slow-moving gases may exist. In this subsonic boundary layer, ambient pressure may advance for a distance, forcing the low-pressure center jet away from the walls. It might be expected that the point of separation will be at the point of optimum expansion, but separation usually occurs further down-stream. In fact, it rarely occurs at all in conventional rocket nozzles within the designed region of operation, unless an extreme case of overexpansion exists or unless excessive nozzle divergence angles are chosen. Thus, in many cases it is correct to base all nozzle calculations on the assumption that no separation occurs, i.e., that the nozzle is filled at all stations (see Fig. 1-11b).

1 .4  PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS OF A LIQUID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINE

The pe r fo rmance  of a rocket  eng ine  can be expressed by a quantity commonly  called "specific impulse" Is. If impulse imparted to the vehicle and propellant weight consumption were measured dur ing a given interval, Is would have the dimension lb sec/lb. In practice, thrust is usually measured in con junction with propellant-weight-f low-rate measure ments. This yields the same dimension: lb/(lb/sec). Is may thus be expressed a s m

I s = F/W (1-28)

Since weight is the force exerted by a mass on its rigid support  under  the influence of gravitation (by convention at sea level on Earth), it has become accepted practice to measure Is in "seconds," by canceling out the terms for the forces. Obviously, the expression does not denote a time, but rather a magnitude akin to efficiency. Specific impulse direct ly contributes to the final velocity of the vehicle at burnout and thus has a pronounced effect on range or size of payload, or both. This will be shown further in connection with Eq. (1-30).

It is important to state whether a specific impulse quoted refers to the thrust-chamber assembly only
(Is)tC or to the overall engine system (Is)oa. Often the distinction may not be self-evident. It is impor tant, therefore, to state accurately to what system the quoted specific impulse refers. In a turbopump-fed system, for instance, overall engine specific impulse may include turbine power  requirements ,  vernier, and attitude-control devices. All of these may be fed from one or all of a given vehicle's propellant tanks. If they are properly considered, the user, in this case the vehicle builder, will obtain the correct value for his own optimization studies, which include pro pellant tank sizes, payload weight, and range, among other parameters.

In many instances, specific impulse (Is)tC for the thrust chamber  only may be significant, such as during the componen t -deve lopment  period of this subassembly. The specific impulse stated (Is)tC will be higher than for a complete system, by 1 to 2
percent, as a rule. The specific impulse thus stated would be too high for the vehicle builder, who must consider the supply of propellants for turbine power and to the auxiliary devices mentioned above as well.

The engine  specific impulse,  along with the vehicle mass ratio, determines the performance of a space vehicle. Mass ratio R is defined by- R = Initial vehicle weight/burnout weight (1-29)

where the initial weight is the total gross weight when the engine ignites and the burnout  weight  is the initial weight minus the propellant consumed.  This value is then used in the "rocket equation" to calculate the ideal delta-v:

AV = g x Is x In(R) (1-30)

The ideal delta-v is the velocity increment that would be added to a vehicle in free space with the engine firing axially. In most real appli-cations the actual velocity increase will be less than the ideal value. A launch vehicle flying from Earth's surface to low orbit will e x p e r i e n c e  veloci ty  losses due  to atmospheric drag, gravitation, and non-axial thrust
(due to engine gimballing to provide steering). For example, the velocity required to maintain a circular orbit at an altitude of 100 n. mi. is about 25,600 ft/s; a launch vehicle, however,  must typically provide an ideal delta-v of about 30,000 ft/s to attain this orbit. For a multistage vehicle, Eq. (1-29) and (1-30) must be applied to each stage individually. The burnout



INTRODUCTION 13

weight of each stage will be reduced by the stage inert weight to get the initial weight of the next stage. The total delta-v is then obtained by adding the values for each stage.

Thrust-Chamber Specific Impulse (Is)tc

The overall performance of the liquid-propellant thrust chamber is a direct function of the propellant combination, the combustion efficiency of propel lants in the chamber, and the product gas expansion performance in the nozzle. The expression for (Is)tc may be obtained in several ways. From Eq. (1-28):

F
(Is),c = Xggtc (1-31)

Combining Eq. (1-31) and (1-7):

c
(Is)tc = - (1-3 la)

g

The effective exhaust velocity c may be further defined as the product of two convenient parameters, c* and Cf:

c =c*Cf (1-3 lb)

where the characteristic velocity c* in feet per second (commonly pronounced "cee-star") is a parameter primarily used to rate the propellant combustion performance. The thrust coefficient Cf is a dimensionless parameter used to measure the gas expansion performance through the nozzle. Combining Eq. (1-3 la) and (1-31b):

c*Cf
(Is),c -- (1-31 c)

g

Is and R will be of ultimate importance to the missile or space-vehicle builder, but both c* and Cf are of great and early importance to the engine and thrust chamber designer and developer.

Characteristic Velocity c*

In a system with sonic velocity at the throat, the quantity c* reflects the effective energy level of the propellants and the design quality of injector and combustion chamber. It may be defined by the following expression:

c* _-- (Pc)nsAtg Wtc (1-32)

This form shows that c* measures combustion performance in a given thrust chamber by indicating how many pounds per second of propellant must be burned to maintain the required nozzle stagnation pressure. A lower value of propellant consumption W under the given condition indicates a combustion process of higher energy and efficiency and gives a correspondingly higher value of c*. By substituting Wtc with Eq. (1-19) in Eq. (1-32), the equation for theoretical c* may be rewritten in the following form:

4g~R(T~).s C* ~ , , .

3' T + I  ~-i

(1-32a)

This form shows that c* is a function of the properties of the product gas at the exit of the combustion chamber (i.e., at the nozzle inlet), namely, specific heat ratio 7, gas constant R, and temperature (Tc)ns.

Thrust Coefficient Cf

The quantity Cf reflects the product-gas expansion properties and design quality of the nozzle. Combining Eq. (1-31), (1-31c), and (1-32), the for theoretical Cf may be written as expression follows:

F Cf - (1-33)

At(Pc),s

This form shows that Cf measures the force augmented by the gas expansion through the nozzle, as compared to the force which would be generated if the chamber pressure acted over the throat area only. By combining Eq. (1-6), (1-18), (1-19), and (1 33), the equation for theoretical Cf at any altitude may be rewritten in the following form:

Cf= /2"t21 [ 2 ]~+1 [ ( P~ ~/]
,- ~ ~ I - \(Pc)n,] J

[po-p ]
+ e (Pc),s J (1-33a)

Equation 1-33a shows that Cf is a function of specific heat ratio 7, chamber pressure Pc, ambient pressure Pa, and nozzle area expansion ratio e .

As will be noted, the throat stagnation pressure
(Pc)ns has been used in Eq. (1-32) and (1-33). This has been the practice in industry and in most of the literature. Briefly, the reason is that (Pc)ns reflects the true theoretical gas property at the nozzle inlet, and gives a more logical value to c* and Cf. In actual operation the true value of (Pc)ns can not be measured. The (Pc)ns is mathematically converted from the measured value of the gas static pressure at the injector, Pinj. The accuracy of this calculated value has to be verified by the test results. Likewise, the gas properties, and thus the specific heat ratio T, which additionally changes along the chamber axis, affect the true values of c* and Cf. This also must be verified by actual test results.

To understand better the nature of Cf and the design parameters that influence it, first rearrange Eq. (1-33) as follows:

F = (Pc)ns  At  Cf (1-34)

The formula says that the thrust generated by a thrust chamber (the effect) is produced by pressure (the



14 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES cause) as a function of the physical properties of the chamber itself. The relationships and effects of the principal design parameters become clearer: through the following steps.

Assume a wish to generate a certain thrust F. The chamber being a straight cylinder (Fig. 1-13), its pressure has a very small effect on the cylindrical wall (the forces normal to the chamber axis will cancel each other), except for effects of friction, which we neglect. There is no part of the chamber for the pressure to act upon at the exit. The only chamber area upon which the pressure can act is the injector plate. Since, for the cylindrical chamber, the injector area Ai equals At, we can wri te Fcyl = PinjAt (1-35)

For the reasons explained [see Eq. (1-34)], Eq. (1.-35)
can be rewritten to include (Pc)ns:

Fcyl = (Pc)ns-At-Cf I (1-36)

Because (Pc)ns is smaller than Pinj (Fig. 1-10), the coefficient Cfl is introduced to correct for this fact.

For instance, if the ratio (Pc)ns/Pinj was found to be
0.8 from Fig. 1-10, Cfl would have to be 1.25 to offset the introduction of (Pc)ns. The use of a thrust coefficient of 1.25 in a straight cylinder thrust chamber for which (Pc)ns/Pinj is 0.8 is merely part of a mathematical rearrangement, but does not signify an increase in thrust for a given Pinj.

The combustion chamber including the injector will have to produce the required pressure (Pc)ns with a flow rate (magnitude determined by c* and throat area At). Transformation of Eq. (1-32) shows the relationship:

(Pc)n, = ~$~rt~ " c* .  ~ (1-3 7)
A.g

In actual practice, the value of c* for a given propellant combination and thrust chamber design will be arrived at tentatively from existing experience and be refined during developmental testing.

Now redesign the cylindrical thrust chamber as shown in Fig. 1-14. Maintaining the same throat area At=Ae, enlarge the combustion chamber including injector to a diameter somewhat  larger than that of At. The flow rate remains Wtc.

In the straight cylindrical chamber (Fig. 1-13), the gas velocity was sonic at the end of the cylindrical chamber portion, which coincided with At and A e. From earlier discussions (see section 1-2), we  k n o w  that e x p a n s i o n  (acce le ra t ion)  is nonisentropic  in that case. In the redesigned chamber (Fig. 1-14) by contrast, gas velocities are still well below sonic velocity at the end of the cylin drical portion. Most of the acceleration to sonic velocity will now occur in the added convergent nozzle. Since we can make the assumption that the combustion process is complete at the end of the cyl indrical  c h a m b e r  por t ion,  the subsequen t expansion (acceler-ation) in the con-vergent nozzle is assumed to be isentropic; i.e., to occur without fur

Since we keep Wtc and A t constant and assume that c* remains unchanged, the nozzle stagnation pressure (Pc)ns will also retain the same value as the straight cylindrical chamber. However, the required total pressure at the injector end will definitely be lower because of the reduced pressure losses in the combustion chamber. The result is a favorable redesign because slightly lighter tanks can be used in pressurized systems because the same propellant flow rate can be sustained with lower tank pressures.

In turbopump-fed systems, the required turbo pump horsepower will decrease. However, the forces acting upon the thrust chamber,  and thus the developed thrust, can be assumed to have remained unchanged because lower pressure acts upon the larger injector and opposing forces are present at the converging nozzle, cancelling each other out.

In short, the redesign (Fig. 1-14) reduces de mands on the propellant feed system for the same Wtc and the same thrust level.

Further redesign of the chamber can include a divergent nozzle section, as in Fig. 1-15. Up to the throat area, nothing changes over the preceding configuration, which includes a convergent nozzle only. Since the gas velocity in the throat area is always sonic (except  for very low, subcritical chamber pressures), the attachment of the divergent nozzle section will have no effect on the previously described gas processes and the pressures upstream of the throat. However, conditions downstream from the throat will now be different.

With the cylindrical chamber, and the chamber with convergent nozzle, the static pressure energy



I N T R O D U C T I O N  15

available at the throat is dissipated by expansion to atmospheric pressure, flowing freely in all directions. Attaching a divergent nozzle prevents the gases from dissipating at random and further accelerates the gases in one preferred direction only. Since this process takes place in the divergent part of the thrust chamber, the static pressures of the expanding gases produce a force on the chamber, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 1-15. Expression of the thrust for the complete thrust chamber with convergent-divergent nozzle can now be written as follows:

Ftc = + ~  p d A -  p d A +  pdA (1-38)
OAt OAt A,

The last expression in the equation represents the gain realized from attaching the divergent nozzle to the throat. Combining all gains into a single coefficient Cf (see Eq. 1-33) again yields Eq. (1-34):

F = (Pc)ns "At  Cf

In brief, it may be stated that the redesign (Fig. 1-15)
produces thrust for the same Wtc and the same feed system configuration.

Summary of  the Influences of  Pa, e ,  7 ,  R, and
(Pc)ns on Engine Performance

Effect of Pa. An ambient pressure Pa reduces the vacuum thrust F of an engine by the amount Pa Ae [see Eq. (1-5)]; Cf will be similarly affected by the amount t;  Pa/(Pc)ns, as shown in Eq. (1-33a). This may be rewritten as Cf=(Cf)vac-t~pa/(Pc)ns . The lower the ambient pressure, the higher will be thrust and performance.  Maximum values are obtained in vacuum.

Effect o f  e. Opt imum thrust for a given ambient  pressure is obtained when  the nozzle expansion area ratio t~ - Ae/A t is such that Pe = Pa. This may be seen from Fig. 1-16. If the divergent nozzle section is extended in the region where pe>Pa, thrust will increase; however, where pe<Pa, leng thening the nozzle will decrease thrust. Therefore, it would be beneficial to design the nozzle to yield Pe =
P a to reach an optimum value for the thrust co efficient. The e for this condition is called optimum nozzle expansion area ratio. Unfortunately, because of changing ambient pressure during flight, no one E is optimum. Trajectory and payload optimization studies usually determine the best compromise. Such a study is not required (except for weight and size considerations) for rockets which start and stop at the same altitude (same ambient pressure), such as upper  stages, where ambient pressure is zero or near zero at all times. For the special case of Pa = 0

(vacuum conditions), E would become infinity to satisfy "ideal expansion." An increase in nozzle ex pansion area ratio increases specific impulse but at the same time increases weight. A payload op timization trading the effects of engine performance and engine weight on payload leads to selection of engine nozzle expansion ratio. For a space engine,

Effect o f  7- The specific heat ratio indicates the energy-storing capacity of the gas molecule. A smaller value of T indicates a higher energy storing capability, and in turn gives higher engine perfor mance. As shown in Eq. (1-32a) and (1-33a), a smaller T will yield a higher value for both, c* and cf.

Effect o f  R ( R  = 1544/M), For constant (Tc)ns Eq. (1-32a) shows that c* will increase if the gas constant R increases; i.e., the gas molecular weight decreases. Thus, a higher value of R will yield a higher engine performance.

Effect o f  ( P c ) n s .  The effective chamber pressure or nozzle stagnation pressure (Pc)ns appears in Eq. (1-33a) for Cf in the form of two pressure ratios, Pe/(Pc)ns and Pa/(Pc)ns. As is evident from Eq. (1-20), the ratio Pe/(Pc)ns has a singular value for a given l; and g (Pc)ns in Eq. (1-33), and therefore influences Cf only through the negative term, Pa/(Pc)ns .  An increase in (pc)nS decreases this negative term and hence increases Cf. This effect is more pronounced when Pa is high. Since the thrust is proportional to both (Pc)ns and Cf, an increase in



16 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES

(Pc)ns in a given thrust chamber  will increase the thrust. The (Pc)ns also has some effect on the combus t ion  process.  Increasing (Pc)ns tends to increase (Tc)ns and to reduce 7 and R. The overall result is usually an increase in c*.

Correc t ion  Factors  and Magni tudes  o f  E n g i n e P e r f o r m a n c e  P a r a m e t e r s

The actual performance of a liquid-propellant rocket engine differs from that of an ideal one because of friction effects, heat transfer, nonperfec t  gases, nonaxial flow, nonuniformity of the working fluid, flow distribution, and shifting gas composition. The latter refers to the fact that the gas properties (y, M, R) are not truly constant along the nozzle axis, as the isentropic t rea tment  of the processes  assumes. Correction factors must therefore be applied to the performance parameters  derived from theoretical assumptions.  Some important  correct ion factors follow:

During the 1970s, the joint Army, Navy, and Air Force (JANNAF) commi t t ee  on rocke t -eng ine performance deve loped  analytical procedures  an chored on test data to calculate the performance correction parameters in a rigorous manner.  Be cause of the extensive nature of the subject and the fact that examples throughout this book are based on coefficients defined by Eq. (1-39) through (1-44), no detailed discussions of the JANNAF rigorous analysis procedures will be made here. The JANNAF Rocket Engine Performance Prediction and Evaluation Manual  (CPIA Publication 246, April 1975) gives further informat ion on performance procedures. Simplified JANNAF performance coefficients have been defined that characterize the principal physical processes occurring in the thrust chamber: pro pellant atomization, mixing, evaporation, chemical reaction, gas expansion; and effects such as chemical reaction rates and boundary-layer  and streamline and velocity-vector divergence in the converging and diverging nozzles.

1.5 LIQUID PROPELLANTS

The term "liquid propellant" covers both liquid oxidizers (liquid oxygen, liquid fluorine, nitric acid, etc.) and liquid fuels (RP-1, alcohol, liquid hydrogen, etc.). In some cases, additives are used (water, ferric chloride, etc.). The propellants furnish the energy and the working fluid for the rocket engines. The selection of the propellants is one of the most important steps in the design of an engine. It greatly affects overall engine system performance as well as the design criteria for each engine component. The propellant selection in turn is influenced by price, supply, handling, and storage considerations.

Monopropellants

Liquid monopropellants may be either a mixture of oxidizer and combust ible  matter or a single compound that can be decomposed with attendant heat release and gasification. A rocket mono propellant must be stable in a natural or controlled environment, yet should produce hot combustion or decomposition gases when pressurized, heated, or fed through a catalyst. A l iquid-monopropel lant engine system usually does have the advantage of simplicity of tankage, feed plumbing, flow control, and injection. Unfortunately, most of the practical mono-propel lants ,  such as hydrogen  peroxide
(H202), have a relatively low performance. Therefore they are mainly used as secondary power sources in rocket engine systems, such as for turbopump gas generators, auxiliary power drives, and attitude and ro l l -cont ro l  jets. Certain h i g h - p e r f o r m a n c e monopropellants, such as methyl nitrate(CH3NO3) , are rather unstable and are considered unsafe for rocket applications. However, some monopropellants that promise relatively high-performance and safer opera t iona l  characterist ics have been  under development recently. If successful, these may effect wider application of liquid-monopropellant engines.

Bipropellants

A liquid-bipropellant system employs two different propellants, usually an oxidizer and a fuel. Separate tanks hold oxidizer and fuel, which are not mixed until they reach the combustion chamber. Present day liquid-propellant rocket engines use bipro pellants almost exclusively because they offer higher performance and safer operation.

Many bipropellant combinations employ igni tion devices such as (a) chemical pyro-technic igniters, (b) electric spark plugs, (c) injection of a spontaneously  ignitable liquid fuel or oxidizer Cpyrophoric fluid") ahead of the propellant proper, or (d) a small combustor wherein ignition is started by devices (a) or (b), in turn starting the main chamber by the hot gas produced.

Other  b ip rope l l an t  combina t ions ,  called hypergolics, ignite spontaneously upon mixing and thus permit greatly simplified ignition, but also pose certain hazards. For instance, accidental mixing of the fuel and oxidizer due to tank or other hardware failures could cause a violent explosion. These hazards must be considered when designing an engine system using hypergolics.

Cryogenic Propellants

Some liquid propellants are liquefied gases of very low boiling point (-230 to -430"F) at ambient pressure and low critical temperature (10 to -400"F). These propellants are defined as cryogenics. The most common cryogenic propellants for rocket appli cations are liquid oxygen (02), liquid hydrogen (H2), liquid fluorine (F2), oxygen difluoride (OF2), or mixtures of some of them. Cryogenic propellants pose storage and handling problems. Elaborate in sulation must minimize losses due to boiloff; the complexity of the insulation will depend on storage period and type of cryogenic. Recently, novel insulating techniques have been under development that should greatly reduce boiloff losses. Adequate venting systems are needed for the developed gases. Storage and handling equipment and components are extremely sensitive to atmospheric or other moisture; even minute quantities may cause a jam ming of, for instance, a valve. The design criteria, including materials selection for engine systems using cryogenic propellants, must consider the very low temperatures involved. The mechanical design of engine components for cryogenic-propellant appli cations will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

Storable Liquid Propellants

In contrast to the cryogenics, certain other liquid propellants are stable over a reasonable range of temperature and pressure, and are sufficiently non reactive with construction materials to permit storage in closed containers for periods of a year or more. These propellants are defined as storables. Storable liquid propellants permit almost instant readiness of the rocket engine and may result in greater reliability due to the absence of extremely low temperatures



I N T R O D U C T I O N  19

and the need to dispose of boiloff vapors. Appli- importance may vary as a function of application:
cation of storables to military vehicles as well as to the upper stages of space vehicles has increased in recent years. The mechanical design of storable propel lant  engine componen t s  will be further discussed in subsequent chapters.

Additives for Liquid Propellants

Sometimes additives are mixed into liquid propel lants to improve cooling characteristics, to depress freezing point, to reduce corrosive effects, to facilitate ignition, and to stabilize combustion.

Optimum Mixture Ratio

A certain ratio of oxidizer weight to fuel weight in a bipropellant combustion chamber will usually yield a maximum performance value called the optimum mixture ratio. As a rule, the optimum mixture ratio is richer in fuel than the stoichiometric mixture ratio and theoretically will see all the fuel completely oxidized and the flame temperature at a maximum. This is because a gas slightly richer in fuel tends to have a lower molecular weight, which results in higher overall engine system performance.  The optimum mixture ratio of some propellant combin ations shifts slightly with changes in chamber pressure. Also, in actual application the mixture ratio may be shifted away from the optimum value for one of the following reasons: lower chamber temperature to stay within the temperature limitations of chamber construction material, required coolant flow, or better combustion stability.

Density Impulse

In addition to the overall system-oriented specific

 High energy release per unit of propellant mass, combined with low molecular weight of the combustion or decomposit ion gases, for high specific impulse.

 Stable combustion.
 High density or high density impulse to min imize the size and weight of propellant tanks and feed systems.

 Low freezing point (preferably less than -65"F)

 Absence of corrosive effects; compatibility with engine construction materials.

 For storables: good storability as assisted by a high boiling point (preferably above 160"F) and by the resistance to deteriorat ion during storage.

 Low viscosity (preferably less than 10 cp down to -65"F) to minimize pressure drops through feed system and injector.

 High thermal and shock stability to minimize explosion and fire hazard.

Computed-program outputs include the following data for both combustion chamber and expansion nozzle: pressure, temperature, molecular weight, gas specific heat ratio, Mach number, enthalpy, entropy, density, sonic velocity, area ratio, species list and concentrations, and C*, Cf and Is.

Three approaches are taken to describe the theoretical gas-expansion characteristics within the chamber and expanding nozzle: frozen, equilibrium, and kinetics.

The flow process is considered to be "frozen"
when the gas composition does not change from the chamber to the nozzle exit. The flow process is considered to be in "equilibrium" if the gas com position does change between the chamber and nozzle exit. Equilibrium expansion represents the highest level for energy release. Equilibrium per formance is calculated to be a higher value because the reactions are reversible. The energy-consuming dissociated species recombine in the nozzle and add to the chemical energy release for the system.

Real-gas expansion is controlled by finite-rate chemistry. A shift occurs in the equilibrium process during expansion, the amount of shift governed by residence time, temperature, and pressure for the expanding gases. Kinetic performance losses occur because the chemical reactions are not fully reversible. A lesser amount of recombination occurs in the nozzle. Special computer programs are used to deter-mine the "kinetic" maximum for per formance. They are part of the TDK package.

The delivered values for C*, Cf and Is are reduced from the theoretical values owing to the losses described in the JANNAF performance section, in the following degrees: incomplete combustion (0 5%), reaction kinetics losses (0-8%), nozzle divergence losses (0-5 %), and boundary-layer drag losses (0-3 %). In practice it has been found that actual test results for total delivered Is is usually 3 12% lower than the theoretical values, depending on thrust, chamber-pressure, and propellant combin ation. Table 1-4 shows the relative performance of a large number  of propel lant  combinations. Physical  p r o p e r t i e s  of impor t an t  l iquid monopropellants and bipropellants are given in Tables 1-5 and 1-6.

Engine Requirements and Preliminary Design Analyses

2.1 INTRODUCTION

A liquid-propellant rocket engine converts the chemical energy contained in tanks into a propulsive force that will propel the vehicle and payload from one place to another. The most encompassing design goal for the rocket engine(s) is to meet all of the mission requirements at the least mission life cycle cost. Desired characteristics of a rocket engine include high thrust-to-weight ratio and high thrust per unit of flowrate (specific impulse, Is). High specific impulse and high thrust-to-weight can lead to lower cost per pound of payload in orbit. Simplicity, ro bustness, and reliability of the power-cycle com ponents are important links in establishing overall vehicle reliability, maintenance, and life (which have a direct effect on system life-cycle cost). Besides high performance (specific impulse and weight)ma requirement of paramount importance for attain ment of mission goals--they too will be very de sirable requirements for the engine system and its components.

The tasks .of engine preliminary design and optimization are the judicious selection of com ponents and component arrangements so that all the desired qualities enumerated above can be fully re fined and mission goals satisfied with minimum investment and risk. This process begins with an initial optimization of an engine cycle configuration that meets a set of vehicle/engine requirements out lined by the customer. Component specifications established from this initial process are then scruti nized by specialists. The succeeding optimizations and refinements aim to endow the engine system with all the desired characteristics.

In the first step of preliminary design (Fig. 2-1), the vehicle requirements are used to establish a large number of the engine requirements. These, together with candidate component definitions, are then used to scope possible engines within reasonable tech nology limitations. With an approach decided upon, the preliminary design process can begin in earnest, first on the engine and then including the com ponents that make it up. This requires some iteration and feedback because the engine is needed to define the components but, at the same time, it is made up of the components. A reasonable guess of the com ponent characteristics will be needed in the be ginning to describe the engine preliminary design so that its characteristics may be obtained. From these, the component characteristics are refined through a process of optimization and iteration. Detailed component design then follows.

The following discussion presents the sequence of considerations in preliminary design process. First, the major rocket-engine design parameters that are typically required by the vehicle are defined. Next, the requirements of various misgions are dis
23

cussed. These requirements dictate the features and goals that are to be emphasized during the design process. This leads into typical optimizations to meet mission requirements. Next comes selection of the optimum engine components. Some advanced en gine component concepts will be discussed, and then some of the procedures used to optimize them re viewed. The section concludes with discussion of design philosophy and considerations to be kept in mind during the entire design process. This leads into the sample engine concepts and designs presented in Chapter 3 and the component concepts, designs, and integration presented in the remainder of the text.

2.2 MAJOR ROCKET-ENGINE DESIGN PARAMETERS

To configure the engine system properly with a vehicle, design and development specifications will have to cover the following parameters above all:
thrust level, performance (specific impulse), run duration, propellant mixture ratio, weight of engine system at burnout, envelope (size), reliability, cost, and availability (time table-schedule).

As the design progresses, numerous additional parameters will have to be considered. Before turning to them, we briefly review and discuss those listed above. It should be noted that the last five items are closely interdependent. For instance, mak ing an engine available in the shortest possible time

("crash program") will raise the cost and will unfavorably affect reliability. A longer design and de velopment period may  not necessarily reduce cost, but it will offer higher values in exchange for the dol lar~higher  reliability, refined (lower) weight, and an optimized (smaller) envelope.

Thrust Level

This engine parameter, a basic one, similar to the power rating of a gasoline engine or electric motor, will affect most of the other engine parameters and many of the development considerations.

The total thrust required of a rocket-propelled vehicle will predominantly be governed by the total takeoff weight of the vehicle (including engine) and the minimum and maximum accelerations permis sible. The number of engines to be used decides the proper  engine thrust level. This decision is often strongly influenced by the availability of already existing engines, which would eliminate, or at least drastically reduce, the design and development cost for the propulsion system. The selection of individual engine thrust level also is-or at least should be  influenced by the general state of the art, particularly if sizes substantially larger than previously developed are considered.

More recently, largely as a result of the advent of manned rocket flight and of the high cost of very large vehicle systems, the decision to use a many engined (clustered) propuls ion system has been additionally affected by safety considerations, to permit mission completion, or at least safe return of the crew, in case of an engine failure. This "engine out" principle is analogous to the consideration of multiple- vs. single-engine airplanes. Extensive studies have been conducted on rocket vehicles to establish the "break-even" point regarding the minimum and maximum number of engines profitably employed in a cluster. Failure of single-engined rocket vehicles not only might destroy the vehicles but also could cause severe damage to expensive ground facilities. This explains the great emphasis  placed on thrust subdivision.

Thrust levels for first-stage booster engines, which start at or near sea-level altitude and stop at a speci fied higher altitude, are usually quoted for sea-level conditions. Additionally, the specifications may contain information on thrust level at altitudes above sea level, frequently in the form of a graph (see Fig.
2-2). The nominal thrust of engines in stages starting and operating at or near vacuum conditions is quoted for that environment.  Most engines are designed for a single nominal thrust (sea level or alti tude), for which they are calibrated by means of propellant-line orifices or, less frequently, with the aid of regulators. Engines designed for variable thrust (throttling) always require some type of regula tor. This will be discussed further in Chapter 7.

Performance

Although the general term "performance" of a rocket engine in the strict sense covers a number  of c* Cf, etc.) specific impulse ( Is ) i s  parameters (Is, , considered the prime performance parameter. As was seen in Chapter 1, specific impulse, also referred to as specific thrust, is measured in "seconds" (not the dimension of time, but an abbreviation of the di mension lb-s/lb; lb/(lb/s) means (specific thrust). It is important to state whether a specified value of I s refers to the complete engine system or to the thrust chamber only. Frequently, by stating a percentage an
"actual" or "practical" value of I s is linked to the maximum value theoretically possible. The theo retical values for the better-known propellant com binations are well established, and as a result prac tical values have become quite predictable. Combin ations less well-known have often produced disap pointments. Great caution should be exercised in the use of theoretical values that have not been verified in tests.

In recent years, the performance of a rocket engine, as expressed by its specific impulse, has received considerable attention, far beyond its true significance. In June 1959, Theodore von Karman observed:

It is my personal belief that the length of  the period of  attaining reasonable reliability in the deve lopmen t  process could  be essent ial ly reduced i f  simple design were emphasized as a leading principle, even if  we had to make  some sacri f ice in the quan t i ta t i ve  measure  o f
"efficiency." Essential elements have to be de signed as simply as possible, even i f  this means a reduction in quanti tative efficiency and  a certain increase of  bulkiness and~or weight.

Undoubtedly, his observations were prompted by a noticeable trend on the part of both the engine builder and the customer to sacrifice, or at least to compromise, nearly all other capabilities of a rocket propulsion system for Is increases, which sometimes amounted to less than one percent.

Frequently, increasing emphasis on Is during the life of a project can be traced to marginal engineer ing reserves in the initial vehicle design, especially with weight assumptions and tank capacities. The need for competitive bidding may have contributed to this situation.

ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 25

On the other hand, the highest Is that can be ob tained without compromise will pay off substantially. For instance, in the case of a typical medium-range ballistic missile, an increase of one second in Is will increase range approximately 15 n. mi. In other terms, an Is increase of less than one-half percent will increase range one percent. As impressive as these figures for increased flight range are, it should be kept in mind that Is should not compromise other engine properties that will determine whether the vehicle will fly at all.

Moreover, Is will prove more critical in some applications than others. In a three-stage vehicle, for example, Is is more critical for the third stage than the second, and it is more critical for the second than for the first. A pound of propellant in the third stage is a pound of payload for the second stage, and therefore requires additional second-stage propellant to lift it, and so on. (This weight multiplication with stage number is discussed in more detail later.) The result: more will be gained by maximizing Is for an upper stage than for a lower. Likewise, there is more benefit in maximizing I s for a high-velocity mission than for a low-velocity one.

D u r a t i o n

Because, by definition, a rocket vehicle carries its own propellant supply, including the oxidizer, its run duration will reflect an optimized balance among takeoff weight, trajectory, thrust level, and minimum and maximum accelerations. Consequently,  run duration times of most large liquid-propellant rocket engines fall into a relatively narrow band, about 50 to
400 s (except for the  Space Shuttle Main Engine, which operates for 500 s, over both the periods of solid-propellant booster operation and the period to orbit after booster separation).

User specifications include formal demonstration
(such as preliminary flight rating tests [PFRT] and qualification tests) requiring accumulated engine firing times, without breakdown, of many times the comparatively short-rated flight duration. These spe cifications therefore govern most engine design considerations, with the exception of the following areas, which for weight considerations are tailored to the flight-run duration:

 Auxiliary tank capacity, for systems which employ a separate turbine power supply.

 Propellant-tank pressurization supply, if it is part of the engine system.

 Lube-oil tank capacity, if applicable.

 Temperature nonequilibria, such as those of un cooled nozzles.

Closely related to the run duration are the start and shutdown characteristics of an engine system, the requirements for both of which may be very stringent in a given vehicle system. The characteristics and the quality of the "start," or "thrust buildup," of a liquid propellant rocket engine are judged by the following factors:

 Compliance with specified thrust-vs.-time charac teristics.

 Maximum rate of increase at any time during buildup.

 Freedom from surges and thrust overshoots.
 Smoothness (freedom from damaging oscilla tions).
 Repeatability from run to run and from engine to engine.

These characteristics will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10, "Engine Systems Design Integration." Suffice it to state at this point that a rocket engine is not easy to adapt to special thrust buildup requirements. Difficulties in this area can arise from inadequate  communicat ion  between vehicle and the engine contractors. Both must thor oughly understand the problems.

The characteristics of engine "shutdown" or
"thrust decay" are predominant ly  influenced by guidance considerations. To understand this better, consider the case of a single-stage, ground-to-ground ballistic missile. As the term "ballistic" implies, the missile imparts a desired speed to a known payload, in a desired direction from a desired point, after which the payload coasts freely to the target. This is analogous to a cannon, where muzzle exit velocity of the projectile, gun-barrel attitude, and location of the gun emplacement will determine the point of impact
(neglecting environmental influences such as wind). With a ballistic rocket, the gun barrel is literally replaced by the guidance system, the intricate com ponents of which not only predetermine the three basic parameters mentioned but also have the ability to compensate for deviations of any or all of them. If, for instance, the trajectory angle near the point of cutoff is too steep, the guidance system will compen sate accordingly, by calling for a higher final ve locity, by slightly delaying the cutoff signal, simul taneously considering the distance over ground al ready covered.

It is obvious that a prompt and repeatable execution of the cutoff signal is imperative. For several reasons, however, it is impossible to effect an instantaneous thrust cessation: time is required to sense and then transmit the cutoff signal; closing of valves requires a finite time; structural (hydraulic-hammer) consider ations are superimposed; residual propellants below the valves have an effect. Figure 2-3 shows a typical thrust-decay diagram. Recall this expression:

Ft = mAv (2-1)

Thrust multiplied by time equals mass times velocity increase:

Ft Av = m  m (2-2)

The velocity increase following cutoff signal is a function of the residual thrust acting on the vehicle mass m, and is integrated over the time from cutoff signal to thrust cessation; this integral is commonly



26 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES referred to as the "cutoff impulse." A typical value for a well-known earlier rocket (Redstone) was 16,000 lb-s
+2500 lb-s. Note the tolerance. This deviation will obviously influence missile accuracy. Reduction of the tolerance is thus an important design and development goal.

It might be concluded that a substantial reduction of the tolerance is the principal task, zero deviation being the optimum. This is unfortunately not so because the final vehicle mass m, on which the decaying thrust force acts, is unpredictable within certain limits, due to weighing tolerances of the initial vehicle mass and to flow-rate and mixture-ratio tolerances. The engine designer and developer will have to concentrate on reducing both: base value and tolerance.

A glance at Fig. 2-3 will show that the area under the thrust curve is a function of not only decay time but also of main-stage thrust level. In fact, the major portion of the shaded area is accumulated before the beginning of thrust decay. This observation has led to the utilization of vernier thrust systems. A vernier cutoff system is characterized by a substantial thrust reduction before cutoff. This can be accomplished by thrust reduction, for a few seconds, of the main engine itself (V-2 fashion) or by shutdown of the main engines, while much smaller engines continue for a brief period (typical: 0-25 s, depending on final AV required).

It should be emphasized that any components that must be added to improve cutoff characteristics are basically undesirable; for they will drastically increase engine complexity. The addition of such components  should be avoided at all costs. Here again, close coordination becomes vital between the vehicle (guidance) designer and engine designer;
thorough understanding of their common problems will be vital.

Mixture ratio

Stoichiometric mixture ratio depends on the type of propellant used. Theoretical temperature and heat release are maximum at this ratio. In rocket engines,

Fig. 2-3 Typical thrust-decay diagram. however, where the highest possible exhaust velocity is desired, optimum conditions often prevail at other than stoichiometric ratios. Equation (1-18) indicates that the gas propert ies strongly affect exhaust velocity. The expression for the specific gas constant R in Eq. (1-18) may be rewritten as follows:

R' (2-3) t = w M where R' is the universal gas constant and M is the molecular weight of the gas (see Table 1-1). The lower the molecular weight, the higher the exhaust velocity, other things being equal. Analytical and experi mental investigations will determine the optimum balance between energy release (heat) and com position (molecular weight) of the gas, a portion of which will consist of gasified but unburnt propellants. The optimum point may also be affected by the following:

 Stay time of  the burning gas in the combustion chamber. Stay time is a function of combustion chamber volume and of gas volumetric flow rate. Complete combustion, even though desirable, re quires a finite time, which will not be available unless the chamber  is relatively large, and correspondingly heavy. A compromise in cham ber size, therefore, is often made. This leaves unburned  a small percentage even of the propellants entering the nozzle, propellants which could have burned given sufficient time
(chamber volume). This percentage must be considered for accurate determinat ion and optimization of the composition of the combus tion gases and when optimizing the gas prop erties with energy release and system weight.

 Cooling cons idera t ions .  The temperatures resulting from stoichiometric or near-stoi chiometric mixture ratios, dependent on propel lant type, may impose severe demands on the chamber-wall cooling system. A lower tempera ture may therefore be desired, and can be obtained by selecting a suitable ratio.

 Propellant density. Propellant density can make it profitable to deviate from the mixture ratio that yields opt imum specific impulse. For example, in the case of the LOX/LH2 propellant combination, where the density of the oxidizer is
16 times that of the fuel, vehicle manufacturers prefer to sacrifice some engine performance to obtain smaller tanks, and thus lower overall system weight. Typically, an engine mixture ratio of 6 is used for LOX/LH2, rather than the opti mum Is mixture ratio of approximately 4.5.

Once the optimum mixture ratio has been de termined for a given engine system, based on the major factors just discussed, it is obvious that deviations from it will penalize engine performance. Since the vehicle powered by an engine will have been sized and tanked to conform with the specified



ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 27

engine mixture-ratio, it is important to know that deviations will also lower vehicle performance--cut run time, owing to premature exhaustion of one of the propellants, and reduce mass ratio, owing to excessive residual amounts of the other propellant
(increased burnout weight). Since the relationship between engine performance (I s ) and mixture ratio for many systems is usually relatively fiat near the optimum point (Fig. 2-4), the effects from duration and burnout weight may well be the most influential ones for vehicle range.

The effects of even minor discrepancies in mixture ratio during the rocket-engine operating time
(propellant utilization) are substantial. In a typical single-stage medium-range ballistic missile, for ex ample, each pound of excess burnout weight will decrease range approximately 0.2 n. mi. For long range vehicles, the penalty is still higher. Active mixture-ratio-control systems have been utilized on systems such as the Atlas that are highly sensitive to residual-propellant effects.

Weight

The parameter of weight, as no other, dominates the thinking of rocket engineers. Success is often gaged directly in pounds of payload flown per dollar spent. The importance weight rightfully carries does not necessarily mean that it is all-important. For instance, a somewhat smaller payload placed into orbit more reliably, or at a lower cost per pound, may be preferred.

As we have seen earlier, a vehicle's final velocity is a function of, among other parameters, its mass ratio. The smaller the final mass, the higher the final velocity. However, since payload mass should be as high as possible, the weight squeeze is applied to all vehicle components  which are not payload. This includes the engine.

To isolate the influence of vehicle structural weight, engineers use a parameter called "propellant fraction." This factor expresses the ratio of the total propellant weight to the fueled vehicle weight without payload. Typical values are 0.94 for turbopump-fed systems and 0.89 for pressure-fed systems. For

Fig. 2-4 Theoretical thrust-chamber performance vs. mixture ratio for N204/N2H4. At pc - 1000 psia shifting equil ibrium and opt imum sea-level expans ion . turbopump-fed engines, the ratio of thrust to engine weight is another useful yardstick. Larger modern liquid-propellant rocket engines may fall into a range from 75 to 125 lb of thrust per pound of engine weight. These figures represent a substantial progress over the past (see Fig. 2-5).

Appendix A presents a more detailed discussion of the various facets of rocket-engine weight and its interaction with the vehicle. Included are considera tions of dry weight, wet weight, propellant weight, residual-propellant weight, and payload weight as well as the influence of structural weight on propellant weight, and the tradeoffs between weight and burnout velocity and be tween  weight  and required per formance.

Envelope (size)

The linear dimensions of liquid-propellant rocket engines require relatively elaborate description and frequently cannot be made clear without a drawing. When only approximate  values are required for comparison or for overall estimates, engineers use the term "envelope". For instance, definition of a hypothetical smallest cylinder, cube, or sphere into which the engine would fit conveys a good feeling of engine size or bulkiness.

Obviously, engine size directly affects engine weight (Fig. 2-5). Increasing engine size also directly affects numerous other areas, such as these:

 The vehicle structure becomes heavier, especial ly with upper  stages. Engine size directly affects the size and thus weight of the aft end and/or interstage structure.

 Handling equipment  and procedures  become more costly.

 Servicing becomes more difficult.
 Manufacturing machinery becomes larger.
 Storage and transportation means become more bulky.

Several of these areas present a definite upper limit, such as railroad tunnel sizes, clearances on bridges and underpasses, and available machine tools.

For a given chamber  pressure, thrust-chamber expansion area ratio has a very pronounced effect on engine envelope.  When  optimizing the thrust chamber  expansion area ratio, which is also in fluenced by performance, weight, pressure drop, heat transfer, and other considerations, its effect on envelope, and thus on other vehicle systems, must be considered.

Reliability

Reliability has become almost a branch of science by itself, engaging, in addition to the designer, develop ment engineer, and user, mathematicians, statisti cians, and "human factor" and "man-rating" special ists. Numerous books have been written on the subject and manufacturers maintain entire groups to predict, monitor, tabulate, and evaluate the reliability of their products.

Reliability may be defined as the ability of the engine to perform according to specifications, when ever "the but ton is pushed." The degree to which it will meet specs can be expressed in figures and graphs. If the evaluation is made following a test series, reliability can be expressed simply as the ratio of success to failure, say, 98% (2 failures and 98
successes in 100 runs). As there is no guarantee, however, that the system under test will perform iden tically in subsequent  tests, reliability predictions will be made, the accuracy ("confidence level") of which will increase with the amount  of information avail able. Statisticians interpret the interrelation of re liability and its confidence level..

What  can the rocket-engine  designer  do to achieve the highest possible reliability, as early as possible? Appendix  B compi les  pointers  and thoughts which have proven valuable, followed by specific details for the implementa t ion  of a re liability-assurance program.

Cost

Cost considerations should enter a design at the very beginning,  not only from the viewpoint  of com petitive bidding and narrow profit-margins, but also



ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 29

in terms of available or developed national re sources. A major rocket program may tax the resources of certain materials, facilities, and services to the limit. Moreover, it should be ascertained that the program does not rely on facilities and on supply of materials and of propellants that may not become available for several years. The rocket engine under design may well be for a project costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Savings of even fractions of a percent can therefore amount to millions.

Cost, as far as the designer is concerned, will be affected by the selection of materials, by the machinery required to make the parts, by the time and skill required to make them, by the difficulty of assembling, testing, and servicing the parts, and last, but not least, by the experience of the people making the design.

Availability (Scheduling)

The best design, the most perfect device, may be useless if it is not available when needed. In a way, the design (in our case) of a rocket engine is a product by itself. It must be planned, prepared, and made. It generates physical products: drawings, written instructions, and procedures, which all must be faultless and available when needed. Delays in the release of drawings can become very costly indeed. In a manufacturer's overall plan of action, the design will be timed and synchronized with other activities. If the drawings are not available on schedule, sizable portions of a machine shop or an assembly plant may be forced to stand idle.

2.3 MISSION REQUIREMENTS

A multitude of missions engender  rocket-engine designs, and each mission has distinctive require ments. Some of these missions will be discussed here along with associated engine design requirements and optimization approaches.

Typical Mission Goals

Many missions require multiple stages to reduce overall vehicle size and propellant consumption. A basic stage consists of engines, propellant tanks, and the required support structure. As the tanks empty, the weight that no longer performs a function becomes dead-weight, and it is more efficient (i.e., requires less propellant) to get rid of it by dropping off the entire stage, and then starting the engines in the next stage, which has full propellant tanks. This technique was used for the Saturn rocket (Fig. 2-6)
that launched the Apollo Mission to the moon. Saturn used three pump-fed liquid-propellant rocket stages to get into orbit around Earth and to initiate the flight from Earth to lunar orbit. The staging sequence is illustrated in Fig. 2-7 for the Apollo 10
flight: a "series burn" because the stages burn in series, i.e., fire consecutively rather than simultane ously.

The current Space Shuttle uses a parallel-burn ar rangement. The first-stage booster engines, which use solid propellant, and the core-stage engines, which use LOX and LH2, start simultaneously and lift the vehicle off. First-stage propellant exhausted, the solid boosters drop off and the core engines continue to burn. Propellants for the core engines exhausted, the core external tank drops off. The core engines remain attached to the Orbiter for recovery. Parallel burn sacrifices some of the payload capacity of series burn to recover the main engines.

Saturn and Space Shuttle will illustrate how the mission and vehicle requirements lead to engine type.

Saturn vehicle f o r  the Apollo Mission. F-1
engines were used in the first stage of the Saturn vehicle. Because they initially exhausted to atmos pheric pressure, they had a relatively high chamber pressure to obtain the higher nozzle area ratio required to obtain high specific impulse. To obtain high chamber pressures without excessive tank weight, they were pump-fed; and because they spent much of the flight in the atmosphere, they used dense fuel
(rather than liquid hydrogen) to minimize tank size, stage inert weight, and aerodynamic drag. Because they were expendable (flew only once), development emphasized the 150-s operating duration. For these reasons, the F-1 engine had the very high thrust of
1.5-million pounds, a high (at that time) chamber pressure of 1000 psia, a dense fuel (RP-1), and, to minimize development costs, a gas-generator turbine drive.

J-2 engines powered the second and third stages of Saturn, five in the second stage and one in the third. These engines had a higher premium on performance because every pound of propellant in an upper stage is a dead weight that must be lifted by the lower stages. Also, upper-stage engines generally exhaust to a vacuum, and therefore do not have to have a high chamber pressure to obtain a high nozzle area ratio. However, the J-2 engine was tested at sea-level conditions. Its area ratio of 27 was selected based on full nozzle flow without the use of an exhaust diffuser. As a result, the J-2 engine, using liquid hydrogen for fuel, had a larger nozzle area ratio with a chamber pressure that was less than that for the F-1. Also, it was designed for lower thrust than the F-1 engine because it did not have to lift as much:
225,000 lb at a chamber  pressure of 787 psia. Because it also was expendable, the J-2 also used the gas-generator cycle to minimize development cost.

Space Shuttle. "Core" engines combine the re quirements of booster and upper-stage engines, and operate during both booster and upper stage flight. Because they burn longer than booster engines, core engines have a higher premium on performance. Unfortunately, they have a limited nozzle area ratio because they must also operate at sea level, where the exhaust pressure is relatively high. Consequently, they have an even higher premium on chamber pressure than booster engines.

The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), an example of such an engine, has the very high chamber pressure of 3000 psia. To maximize per formance at this high chamber pressure, it utilizes a staged combust ion cycle in which all of the propellants burn in the thrust chamber at high pressure. To minimize the weight of the resulting

32 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES high-power turbomachinery, the SSME utilizes boost pumps to allow the main pumps to operate at high speed without cavitation. These same high speeds require the use of high-speed bearings, seals, turbines in the main turbopumps. Because of these features, the SSME has pushed technology further than any other rocket engine.

A t t i t u d e  con t ro l  a n d  o r b i t - m a n e u v e r i n g  en g i n e s .  Attitude-control and orbit-maneuvering engines have low thrust compared to the engine types just discussed for obvious reasons. Also, their operating durations are usually shorter, ranging from a few milliseconds to a few seconds. Because of these two factors, small size and short duration, turbo pumps are not always practical (unless accumulators are used) and, as a result, these engine types are very often pressure-fed. For similar reasons, standard re generative cooling is often replaced with radiation, ablative, and inter-regen cooling (a combination of film cooling augmented by conduction back to the injector). Also, because attitude-control engines often must be operational over a long period of time in orbit, they often use storable propellants.

M i s s i l e .  Missile main-propulsion engines can have thrust ranging from the orbit-maneuvering engine (OME) type to the levels of the larger engines discussed above; and they have operating durations between those of the attitude-control engines and the others. Although having short operating durations, they must be storable for long periods because they are generally used only during times of conflict. They are mass-produced and expendable for obvious reasons. This combination of requirements results in features that are similar to those for attitude-control and orbit-maneuvering engines; i.e., pressure-feed, modest chamber pressure, storable propellants, and non-regenerative cooling. Because they operate for a relatively long time as compared to attitude-control engines, pure radiation cooling would be inadequate. However, the other cooling options (ablative and inter-regen) would be applicable.

M a n n e d .  A manned vehicle creates a premium on reliability and crew safety. Those factors make manned vehicles much more costly to build and to operate. Of the engine applications discussed above, all but the missile could be man-rated by utilizing a carefully structured design, development, and testing program.

E x p e n d a b l e .  An expendable engine will not be recovered once it has completed its mission. The engines in the Saturn vehicle were expendable, while the engines in the Space Shuttle are reusable. This has a significant impact on the technology level used for an engine. An expendable engine may use a compatibility and life of components such as seals that are in contact with propellants for an extended period of time. Typical propellants for these applications include nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine derivatives such as monomethylhydrazine
(MMH). Engines of this type include the Titan engines that propel missiles that are stored for long times in silos and the XLR-132, a small engine (3750 lb thrust) intended for use in orbit transfer. (The XLR-132 was designed to be earth/space storable for on-demand use over a three-year period.)

Typical Vehicle-Requirement Optimization

A Boeing analysis (Fig. 2-8) of a single-stage-to-orbit
(SSTO) vehicle illustrates a typical optimization in which engine design parameters are selected based on their impact on vehicle capabilities. For this horizontal-takeoff vehicle launched from a rocket propelled sled, parametric engine thrust, weight, and performance data were supplied by the engine manufacturer to Boeing, and it then used the data to predict the impact on vehicle gross weight and payload. Three separate engine parameters--thrust, nozzle area ratio, and chamber pressure--were opti mized.

Thrus t .  Figure 2-8c shows vehicle gross liftoff weight (GLOW) as a function of thrust per engine and number of engines. As indicated, vehicle payload was held constant at 65,000 lb. For each curve, each of which is for a fixed number of engines, GLOW reaches a minimum. For engine thrust below this minimum, vehicle accelerations and velocities are low. That causes inefficient propellant consumption, because it is best to accelerate to a high velocity early in the vehicle trajectory to minimize the amount of propellant that has to be carried to a higher altitude. The inefficient propellant consump tion results in a larger GLOW due to a larger propellant load, despite the fact that engine weight and vehicle aerodynamic drag are lower. For engine thrust above the minimum, the reverse happens; a high velocity is attained early in the trajectory, but the engine weight and the vehicle aerodynamic drag are up, and the latter two dominate. Consequently, any given number of engines will have a design
(engine) thrust that minimizes gross liftoff weight of the vehicle. This minimum GLOW should correlate with minimum cost.

Figure 2-8c also shows that GLOW increases with number of engines; support structure for the engines lowers thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W). This has to be balanced, however, against the greater reliability of the greater number of engines. If an engine goes out, the remaining engines may be able to complete the lower technology and a less stringent development mission if the failure occurs late in the burn. If it program, occurs early in the burn, the remaining engines

34 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES optimum total thrust for this type of vehicle lies between 1.00 and 1.05 times GLOW.

N o z z l e  area ratio. Figure 2-8e illustrates the optimization of the area ratio of a dual-position nozzle for the engines. As the area ratio in the retracted skirt position (position 1, which is used at takeoff when the ambient pressure is highest) drops below the baseline, the GLOW initially decreases because the performance at low altitude is improving. However, at a position 1 area ratio of 50, the nozzle skirt, which is the retracting part of the nozzle, can no longer be retracted around the engine because its minimum diameter is smaller than the envelope of the engine-power head. This makes it necessary to change to a heavier nozzle-retraction device for position-1 area ratios less than 50. As a result, a position-1 nozzle area ratio of 50 would be the optimum from a minimum-GLOW standpoint.

Chamber  p r e s s u r e .  A staged combustion cycle was selected to meet the high engine-performance requirements of SSTO vehicles. For that type of engine cycle, two factors cause an optimum: sea-level performance and engine weight. Sea-level perfor mance increases with chamber  pressure because increasing the chamber  pressure increases the allowable nozzle area ratio in the retracted position. This causes payload to increase with chamber pressure. The other factor is engine weight. Thrust chambers are heavy at low chamber pressures and turbopumps are heavy at high chamber pressures, a situation that generally results in a minimum total engine weight occurring at about 2500-psia chamber pressure. For the vehicle under consideration, these two factors produce an optimum payload near 4500 psia chamber pressure, as shown in Fig. 2-8f. Because the curve is relatively fiat in the vicinity of the optimum, and because a further increase in chamber pressure would increase the number of stages in the hydrogen fuel pump, it was concluded that a baseline chamber pressure of 3500 psia would be appropriate.

2.4 ENGINE PRELIMINARY DESIGN

The next step in the design process, determining the engine and engine-component parameters that meet the requirements of the mission and vehicle, begins with selecting candidate concepts. Then optimizing them yields a preferred concept, together with the preliminary design parameters that are used (as discussed in later chapters) to initiate detailed design of the components.

Engine System and Component  Concepts

For the application at hand, engine candidates are synthesized from a known stock of system and subsystem concepts. Typical advanced engine and engine-subsystem concepts for a SSTO vehicle are

It is apparent that there must be some interplay between the concept selection and the vehicle requirement optimization discussed above, because some of the assumptions used in the vehicle optimizations are the subsystem concepts  and components.  For example, the engine cycle was assumed in the vehicle requirement optimization and, at the same time, the engine cycle is one of the engine concept variables in Table 2-1.

Engine System Configuration. The top three concepts in Table 2-1 are the most common turbine drive cycles for pump-fed liquid-propellant rocket engines. The schematic flow paths for these cycles are illustrated in Fig. 2-9. As indicated, all are fuel cooled. Also, the single-shaft turbopump arrange ment (i.e., one turbine driving both the fuel pump and the oxidizer pump that are mounted on the same shaft) is shown for the basic cycles in Fig. 2-9 to keep the schematics as simple as possible. More-complex concepts are discussed later.

The gas-generator cycl e (Fig. 2-9a) is the only one of the three that has the turbine flow-path in parallel with the thrust chamber flow-path. This largely separates the two functions and makes the gas generator  engine much easier to develop and operate. It does have a performance penalty, however, due to three facts: 1) the turbine-drive gases are not fully expanded as in the thrust chamber, 2)
the turbine gases are not fully combusted to the mixture ratio of the thrust chamber, and 3) there is a mixture-ratio shift (away from optimum) created in the main thrust chamber when flow is taken from the system to supply the gas generator. The inherent simplicity of this type of engine makes it a prime candidate for both booster and space engines. The F-1 and J-2 engines used for the booster and upper stages, respectively, for the Saturn launch vehicle used this type of cycle.

The expander  cycle (Fig. 2-9b) avoids the turbine-drive gas losses of the gas-generator cycle by placing the turbine in series with the thrust chamber, exhausting directly into it. This cycle differs from the other two in that there is no combustion upstream of the turbine; the turbine-drive gas is the fuel after it has been heated in the thrust-chamber cooling jacket. This limits the turbine inlet temperature, which, in turn, limits the attainable chamber pressure. As a result, this engine is primarily a space engine where it can exhaust to a vacuum and, consequently, can have a very high nozzle area ratio in spite of its lower chamber pressure. The RL-10 engine for the Centaur vehicle uses this type of cycle.

The staged combust ion  cycle (Fig. 2-9c)
resembles the expander cycle in that it has the turbine exhausting directly into the thrust chamber, and is similar to the gas-generator cycle in that it has combustion upstream of the turbine. For booster applications, this engine can perform better than the summarized below under  the major headings of gas-generator cycle because it has no secondary-flow system configuration, nozzles, thrust chambers, and losses, and can perform better than the expander turbomachinery. A high-pressure pump-fed engine is cycle because the higher turbine-inlet temperature assumed due to the per formance  and thrust allows it to have a higher chamber pressure and, requirements of the typical application studied. The consequently, a larger nozzle area ratio. As a space list includes both current-technology and advanced- engine, it has an advantage over the expander cycle technology concepts, in that, due to its higher chamber pressure, it can

attain the same performance with a smaller nozzle. However, relative to the other two cycles, the staged combustion cycle has the highest performance but it is more complex, more difficult to develop, and heavier. The SSME uses this type of cycle.

In actual practice, most of these engines do not use the single-shaft turbopump arrangement, as shown in Fig. 2-10. The J-2 and the SSME use a separate turbopump for each propellant (dual shaft), and the in RL-10 a gear drives the LOX pump off the LH 2 turbopump drive shaft. Figure 2-10 shows the J 2S engine, a modified form of the J-2. The J-2S obtains its turbine-drive gas by tapping the main combustion chamber.

Other eng ine-cyc le  concepts  are basically derivatives, combinations, or variations of those in Fig. 2-9. Some of them are summarized in Table 2-2.

The hybrid staged-combustion cycle (Table 2-2d)
represents a compromise between the high perfor mance of conventional staged combustion (Fig. 2-9c and Table 2-2a) and the simplicity of the expander
(Fig. 2-9d). It uses the staged combustion cycle to drive the fuel turbopump and the expander cycle to drive the oxidizer turbopump. In this manner, lower

Staged combustion cycle with oxidizer-rich preburner to drive the LOX turbomachin ely and a fuel-rich preburner to drive the fuel turbomachin ery. All oxygen is combusted in the preburners so there is more turbine drive gas than in conventional staged-combus tion cycle. Fuel regenerative cooling is used for the main combustion chamber.

The dual-expander engine uses an arrangement oi con centric combustion chambers to obtain lower area ratio per formance with both combus tors firing and high area ratio performance with only outer combustor firing. This ar rangement requires a more complex cooling and propel lant injection scheme.

The hybrid staged combus tion cycle is a variation of the conventional staged combus tion cycle, in this cycle fuel turbine is driven by a fuel rich preburner and the oxid~ er turbine is driven by heated hy0rogen supplied by heat exchange in a portion of the nozzle.

The dual-expander engine achieves an increase in specific impulse when the outer corn buster  is firing with the inner shut clown. This can be advan tageous for launch vehicles which must first operate from within the atmosphere and then in vacuum conditions.

The chamber pressure delivery anti performance of this cycle is lower than the conventional staged-combustion cycle.

Performance of the gas gener ator is lowered by two fac tors: (1) the lower specific impulse of the turbine exhaust gases due to their lower tem peratures, and (2) the shift in thrust chamber mixture ratio necessa~" to balance the effect of the fuel-rich turbine ex haust gases.

As with conventional staged combustion cycle, thrust chamber weight decreases with chamber pressure. Re quired pump power increases substantially with increasing chamber pressure due to in terdependency of flow cir cuits. Turbopump and power head weight increases more rapidly with chamber pressure than for gas generator cycle.

The increased complexity of the thrust chamber design will result in a heavier thrust chamber and injector configu ration. Also there are an in creased number of control valves on the engine.

There is some weight differ ence due to the removal of the ox'ygen preburner. Heated hydrogen is the turbine work ing fluid and restllts in a larg er ox)'gen turbine.

The weight of the gas genera tor cycle is less than that of closed cycles such as the sta ged-combustion cycle. Gas generator cycles are usually run at moderate pressure to avoid the higher loss asso ciated with high pressure de signs.

Also mechanical and struc tural design of turbopump are key engine reliability drivers. The oxidizer-rich environment is a reliability area that needs to be as sessed with both advantages and disadvantages existing.

The more advanced nature of this configuration points to a lower initial system re liability. The chamber con figuration and adequate cooling during both modes of operation will largely determine overall engine reliaiblity.

The main attribute of this cycle is the use of lower temperature turbine drive fluids with attendant bene fits in reliability and life.

Development of $SME gives strong technical base for de velopment of stage, d-combus tion engines having different design point thrust and cham ber pressure. Regenerative cooling of thrust chamber feasible at 130 to 200K vacu um thrust level at chamber pressures up to 4,500 I~ia.

Development of SSME gives strong technical base for de velopment of the mixed pre burner staged-combustion engine. Regenerative cooling of thrust chamber feasible at
130 to 600K vacuum thrust level at chamber pressures up to 6,000 psia. The oxidizer rich turbine drive technology needs to be developed and risks need to be assessed.

Technology is required in the basic thrust chamber to deter mine configuration and the proper contour. This can be clone in a cold-flow diagram. The proper cooling method
(transpiratioWregenerative)
must be demonstrated for a long life chamber.

Advanced technology is re quired to raise chamber pres sure to higher levels than cur rently delivered by SSME. Areas for technology ad vancement are the pump stag ing, crossovers, and bearings.

The technology requirements for gas generator cycle en gines are moderate due to the large amount of development work previously accomplished on this system.



38 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES turbine-drive temperatures can be realized together with a gain in reliability and life, for only a small penalty in performance.

The mixed-preburner staged combustion cycle
(Table 2-2b) uses an oxidizer-rich preburner to drive the oxidizer pump so as to maximize the power available to drive the turbomachinery,  thereby yielding the cycle with the highest chamber pressure.

The dua l - expande r  (mean ing  dual- thrust chamber expansion) cycle (Table 2-2c) uses dual combustion chambers arranged concentrically to yield a dual nozzle area ratio, which improves performance by allowing the nozzle area ratio to be larger at high altitudes.

Other system concepts in Table 2-1 include propellant-related options such as optimum mixture ratio and the use of slush hydrogen. Optimum mixture ratio refers to variable engine mixture ratio with the LOX/LH2 propellant combination. To do this, high engine mixture ratios (up to 12 to 16) are used for the booster operating mode and low engine mixture ratios (4 to 6) are used for the space operating mode. In the booster mode, high mixture ratio yields the high propellant bulk densities desired to minimize both tank sizes and vehicle aerodynamic drag when traveling in the atmosphere and, in the space-engine mode, where there are few factors to compromise performance, low mixture ratio yields high performance to minimize total propellant con sumption and, consequently, total weight. The net benefit of this concept is a smaller total tank size. This has to be traded off against greater system complexity and a greater total propellant weight.

The last system in Table 2-1, a slush-hydrogen en gine, employs partially frozen hydrogen to increase the propellant density, thereby reducing tank size. This has to be traded off against the higher cost of obtaining and maintaining hydrogen in a slush condition.

N o z z l e s .  The standard nozzle for rocket engines, the bell (Fig. 2-11A) nozzle, has a bell shape for the portion downstream of the throat. For high pressure pump-fed engines, bell nozzles are generally regeneratively cooled by the fuel. They are very efficient for the altitude for which they are designed. However, their area ratio is fixed and, as a result, booster engines with this type of nozzle operate off f Injector Injector f ~ ' ~ i  cem~-~, c~-.~r

ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 39

design for all but that moment when they pass through the nozzle design altitude. The nozzle concepts summarized in Table 2-3 are all designed to provide some degree of altitude compensation, thereby alleviating the performance penalties of the fixed nozzle. As shown in Table 2-3, the degree of compensation ranges from optimum performance at two altitudes up to optimum performance at all altitudes (up to the area-ratio limit of that nozzle). Some achieve this capability mechanically, and some achieve it aerodynamically. All achieve it at the ex pense of weight and complexity. The final selection would be based on a tradeoff between the benefits of improved  per formance  and the penalt ies of increased weight and greater complexity.

The first concept in Table 2-3, the multiposition nozzle shown in Fig. 2-11B, usually consists of the basic bell, with one or more movable extension seg ments that can be moved into position to increase the overall nozzle area ratio to match the reduced ambient pressure that occurs as the vehicle gains altitude. The result is optimum performance at two or more altitudes, depending on the number of movable segments.

The variable-position nozzle can yield optimum performance continuously. An example, the over lapping-petal arrangement used in turbojets, may be very heavy and very complex, particularly if used in combination with regenerative cooling. As indicated in the table, this type of nozzle has not been used for rockets.

A candidate that also offers continuous altitude compensation, the aerospike (Fig. 2-11C), has an annular throat with expansion along the spike wall. Because there is no outer wall, the outer plume is free to adjust with altitude. The resulting excellent altitude compensation must be balanced against the weight of the large annular combustion chamber and the associated cooling of the large surface area.

The expansion-deflection nozzle (E-D, in Fig. 2 l lD) avoids some of the combustion-chamber weight and cooling problems of the aerospike by essentially reversing the flow path of the aerospike nozzle. The flow is directed radially outward through the annular throat, thereby resulting in a more conventionally sized combustion chamber. Also, the annulus diameter is much less, thereby greatly reducing the cooling area in the region of the throat, where the cooling problem is the most critical. The altitude compensation occurs by having the plume in the center of the nozzle vary with altitude. As with the aerospike, some flow through the base region is desirable to increase base pressure and improve nozzle performance.

The dual bell (Fig. 2-11E) steps the nozzle contour so that the plume separates from the nozzle wall at the step during low-altitude operation, and follows the contour below the step during high altitude operation. This yields optimum perfor mance at two altitudes (assuming one step), similar to the multiposition nozzle with one translating segment. Relative to the multiposition nozzle, it has the advantage of not requiring a heavy translating mechanism, but has the disadvantage of a larger volume.

T h r u s t  C h a m b e r s .  As shown in Table 2-4, four of the advanced thrust-chamber concepts involve cooling-jacket options to improve chamber life. Two of the four achieve longer life by cooling the chamber wall at the expense of engine performance. The other two achieve longer life by using high temperature low-conductivity thermal barriers that require development.  In assessing these four cooling-jacket options, the first two involve a tradeoff between life and performance, and the second two involve a tradeoff between life and the cost of development and fabrication.

Transpiration cooling utilizes a porous thrust chamber wall through which coolant seeps. The resultant evaporation on the wall surface and the concentration of coolant along the wall both keep the wall cooler than with purely regenerative cooling.

However, the concen tration of coolant along the wall results in less propellant being fully combusted at the entrance to the thrust chamber, which results in less propellant being fully expanded in the nozzle. This constitutes a loss, which must be traded against the advantages dis cussed above.

Film cooling obtains a similar result by i n t r o  ducing coolant through passages in the combustion chamber wall. That flow is introduced through small passages, rather than through the porous wall used in transpiration cooling. The coolant then helps cool the downstream wall by flowing along the wall surface. The film can also be introduced at the injector face by concentrat ing some of the fuel injector elements along the wall. As with the trans piration cooling, a loss clue to incomplete combus tion and expansion of the film coolant occurs.

The next two candidates in Table 2-4, refractory and rhenium liners, are high-temperature,  low conductivity thermal barriers applied to the hot-gas side of the thrust chamber. These barriers reduce the heat flux and the temperature of the thrust-chamber wall. As above, this can either increase the life of the thrust chamber for a given chamber pressure or increase the chamber pressure for a given life. An additional benefit of these candidates is that they can permit operation at high chamber pressures. As major disadvantages, both liner candidates need development to ensure that they have the ability to meet the rocket-engine life requirements.

The last thrust-chamber concept involves the use of injectors without baffles. This concept involves a slight risk of instability. However, experience with the SSME has indicated that this risk is very low with LOX/LH2. Removal of baffles to improve perfor mance is probably advisable. In this case, the tradeoff is between the penalty of a slightly greater risk of instability and the benefits  of better performance, reduced weight, and reduced cost.

Turbomacbtnery. The nine turbomachinery op tions in Table 2-5 potentially can increase efficiency, decrease weight, increase life, or do some com bination of the three. These options are discussed individually below in the order of presentation in Table 2-5.

Increasing the number of pump stages generally increases efficiency, throttleability, and margin

relative to the impeller tip-speed limit. Also, it decreases pump diameter at the expense of increased pump length. However, it increases complexity and cost. The net impact on the engine is improved performance and throttleability. The impeller life may be extended, but the life of the shaft-support sys tem may be compromised by critical speed. Cost and complex-ity would increase for the engine just as for the pump. In general, the number of pump stages is minimized within the tip-speed limits if the stage specific speed is over 700, which is sufficient to yield a reasonable efficiency.

Designing turbopumps for high rotational speed tends to increase the efficiency of the pump, may increase the efficiency of the turbine, and definitely decreases the weight of the entire turbopump. If the speed is too high, however, the lives of the bearings and seals can be compromised, cavitation damage and/or  insufficient pressure rise can occur in the pump impeller if not enough inlet pressure is supplied, and the turbine blades can be overstressed. In general, the design rotational speed needs to be maximized within component limits that provide rea sonable operating margins for the components.

Hydrostatic bearings eliminate the bearing rotational-speed limits by eliminating the rolling elements in the bearings. This also theoretically eliminates the bearing life limits as long as metal-to metal contact is avoided. Disadvantages are a de crease in pump efficiency due to an increase in flow leakage and an increase in development cost due to the lack of a broad base of experience with this type of bearing. In general, hydrostatic bearings are now being r ecommended  for long-life and high performance rocket engine applications.

Magnetic bearings achieve the same objective as hydrostatic bearings by supporting the shaft by magnetic rather than hydrostatic forces. They have an additional advantage of being able to compensate for shaft oscillations by varying the strength and frequency of the magnetic forces. At present, how ever, practical magnets are too weak to support the shaft with any reasonable size of bearing. The state of-the-art for this type of bearing is still in its infancy.

High-velocity crossover passages from the exit of one centrifugal-pump stage to the entrance to the next tend to improve the efficiency and decrease the size and weight of multistage centrifugal pumps. In general, they are used for high-pressure liquid hydrogen pumps.

For small pump-fed rocket engines (thrust levels less than 30,000 lb), multistage partial-admission turbines can be used to obtain reasonable blade heights at the high-pitch-line velocities that yield high turbine efficiencies. The net impact on the engine is a higher chamber pressure, which can be used to reduce engine size and weight for a given performance or to obtain higher performance from a given engine size and weight.

Jet pumps are very simple units that can be used for boost pumps. They utilize high-pressure flow that is recirculated from the main pump discharge to pressurize the low-pressure incoming flow. This is done in an ejector, and therefore the jet pump has no moving parts. Using this type of pump in this application yields the benefits of a boost pump
(higher efficiency and lighter weight for the main turbopump) with very little increase in either com plexity or cost. As its major drawback, the jet pump has very low efficiency. When selecting a boost pump, therefore, the tradeoff is between the simplicity of the jet pump and the higher efficiency of a conventional low-pressure rotating pump and drive.

High turbine-inlet temperatures are very de sirable for engine cycles because they increase the amount of energy available per unit flowrate to drive the turbomachinery. This increases the pump pres sure rise per unit turbine flowrate, which, in turn, increases the chamber pressure attainable for a given turbine flowrate. This increased chamber pressure can be used in one of several ways, such as to increase the nozzle area ratio and the performance or to decrease the engine size and weight for a given nozzle area ratio. In any event, high turbine-inlet temperatures are beneficial. Any turbine material that has a higher-temperature capability is desirable. This capability can also be used to increase the operating margin relative to the ultimate limit, which, for a given turbine-inlet temperature, will increase life and reliability.

An alternative method for raising the turbine inlet temperature--using a portion of the propellant to cool the blades and/or the rotor--can increase the operating stress level for a given hot-gas temperature, thereby allowing either a higher rota tional speed (higher blade stress) to yield a lighter weight turbopump or a higher pitch-line velocity
(higher disc stress) to yield higher efficiency. In addition, it can simply be used to increase the life and reliability of an existing unit under its existing operating conditions. As a disadvantage, cooling usually requires additional propellant consumption, a performance penalty. To be beneficial, the advan tages of turbine cooling have to outweigh the performance penalty.

A material and design option that has the po tential of allowing higher turbine-inlet temperatures, the use of hollow ceramic blades held in compression by a metal fixture that passes through the hollow portion, requires considerable develop ment effort to ensure that the attachment eliminates the brittleness associated with ceramics.

Preliminary Design Optimization

Once a set of candidate components  has been selected, the engine must be optimized to yield the design parameters for the components. As discussed earlier, the basic overall goal will usually be mini mum vehicle life-cycle cost per unit of payload. Because this cost is the total cost related to the engine during its operating life, the optimization analysis must include consideration of such factors as performance, weight, development, design, fabr i  cation, maintenance, servicing, and operations, as well as propellant selection. In general, maximizing performance and minimizing weight within reason able technology limits will contribute to minimizing many of these costs. Performance and weight are



42 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES much easier than the other factors to quantify early in the design process. Therefore, maximizing perfor mance and minimizing weight are usually the initial design goals, which are then tempered by cost considerations.

In the optimization process, the various com ponents are characterized basically as a function of chamber pressure, and the chamber pressure is varied to yield engine performance and weight as a function of it. The design is not permitted to exceed any of the component limits that are specified to keep the engine within a safe design region. These limits may fall into the category of envelope
(maximum length and diameter allowed by the installation in the vehicle), interface (minimum pump-inlet and nozzle-exit pressures allowed by the vehicle), stress (pump impeller tip speeds, turbine blade stresses, bearing speed), or fluid-mechanical factors (cavitation in the pumps). In the discussion below, the performance and weight optimization processes are discussed individually.

Performance. Thrust-chamber performance usually increases with chamber pressure. High pres sure reduces performance losses, such as those due to reaction kinetics. Thus high pressure and high area ratios can be permitted. In addition, there is usually some limit on the nozzle-exit conditions, such as minimum exit static pressure for a booster engine or maximum nozzle-exit size for an upper-stage engine, which limits expansion area ratio. As a result, increasing chamber pressure increases maximum permissible nozzle area ratio and thrust-chamber performance. This thrust-chamber performance trend with chamber pressure is shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 2-12. For staged-combustion and expander cycles, the engine performance equals the thrust-chamber performance. As a result, simply maximizing chamber pressure maximizes engine performance. That issue is discussed in more detail below. For the gas-generator cycle, the secondary flow losses (due to the turbine-drive gas path being in parallel with the thrust chamber) are proportional to pump pressure rise, which, in turn, is roughly propor tional to chamber pressure. When these losses are deducted from the thrust-chamber performance, the resulting curve of engine performance vs. chamber pressure has a definite maximum, as shown in Fig. 2 12. The procedure used to optimize gas-generator cycle performance finds that maximum.

As discussed above, the performance for staged combustion and expander cycles will be optimized by maximizing chamber pressure within other constraints. That procedure is illustrated by Fig. 2-13, which shows the relationship between turbine pressure ratio, chamber pressure, and turbopump efficiency (product of pump and turbine efficiencies). For a given value of turbopump efficiency, the curve of pressure ratio vs. chamber pressure curves upward, eventually reaches infinite slope, and then curves backward as the increase in required turbine pressure drop begins to exceed the corresponding increase in pump pressure rise. For a given turbopump ef ficiency, there will be a maximum chamber pressure and, in turn, a maximum performance; but, for a given number of pump and turbine stages, turbo pump efficiency declines as pump pressure rises and the corresponding turbine pressure ratio increases. This results in a fixed staging optimum that occurs at lower values of turbine pressure ratio and pump pressure rise than the fixed efficiency optimum, as also shown in Fig. 2-13. Therefore, the procedure used to optimize staged combustion and expander

cycle engines will determine the optimum chamber pressure on the appropriate fixed turbopump staging curve. This has to be done within the engine component technology limits, such as pump-impeller tip speed. The optimum shown in Fig. 2-13 is satis factory in that it occurs at a pump-impeller tip speed below the technology limit.

Weight. Rocket-engine component weight trends with chamber pressure are shown for LOX/
hydrocarbon engine candidates in Fig. 2-14 through
2-19. For a fixed thrust, thrust-chamber weight decreases with increasing chamber pressure (Fig. 2 14) because the thrust-chamber size decreases. On the other hand, turbopump weight increases with chamber pressure (Fig. 2-15) because horsepower is proportional to pressure rise, which, in turn, is roughly proportional to chamber pressure. Ducting and pressurization system weights also increase with chamber pressure (Fig. 2-16) because increased internal pressures increase the wall thickness of ducts and pressure vessels. Other components show little impact of chamber pressure (Fig. 2-17). As the end result of these trends, engine weights reach minimums at chamber pressures between 2000 and
3000 (Fig. 2-18 and 2-19). This is typical for pump-fed liquid-propellant rocket engines.

As shown in Fig. 2-18, staged-combustion-cycle engines are considerably heavier than gas-generator cycle engines, because staged turbines are in series with the thrust chamber, whereas gas-generator turbines are in parallel. The series arrangement produces much higher pump pressure rises for the staged combustion cycle, which, in turn, results in heavier turbopumps (Fig. 2-15), heavier ducts (Fig. 2 16), and heavier valves, preburners, and manifolds
(Fig. 2-17). The only major component that is not significantly affected by this cycle difference is the thrust chamber (Fig. 2-18).

44 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

2.5 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Once the overall engine concept has been defined, the design process can begin. Several factors must be kept in mind. Design quality must be ensured, and a procedure to maintain it throughout the design process must be established. The tasks used to conduct the systems analysis and generate the design layout must occur in the proper sequence and must complement one another. Finally, thorough stress analyses and material selections must be made throughout the design process in order to be able to meet  the s t r ingent  rel iabi l i ty  and we igh t requirements.

The Importance of Design Quality

Even today, many people regard the design of technical objects as not much more than the act of putting pencil lines on large pieces of paper. The general concept of design is much broader. Many a designer may not even occupy a drawing board, since he may be completely devoted to the creation of basic ideas and solutions, to the numerical checking of their validity, or to the planning, direc tion, and integration of a design team. On the other hand, many of the most successful designers always retain their board- - the i r  most valuable tool of creat ionmhowever  advanced their position in the organization may be.

It is commonplace to state that a technical project will stand or fall with the quality of its design. Obviously, no device can be built, tested, or used until and unless it has been specified first how to build, test, and operate it. With this in mind, a completed design can be considered a set of instructions for shop actions to follow. For instance, final drawings are only the end product  of an extensive, diversified effort which preceded their re lease. All this is well known, yet sometimes forgotten in the daily grind of a project. Suffice it to state that the design and the designer are principal links of the chain in a project.

This book attempts to supply  some of the necessary special tools required to arrive at a de tailed "set of instructions" to the shop foreman, from which an engine could be actually built and prepared for test. The following chapters are devoted to the necessary technical detail, based on the latest state of the art in the field of l iquid-propellant  rocket engines.

The numerous areas that the designer should consider early and keep in mind at all times, for overall increase of quality and reliability and for reduction of cost, include the following:

 Experience, reliability, and reputation of sub contractors and their products.

 Adequate receiving inspection.
 Clear and complete instructions for inspection and quality control.
 Full use of the experience of others in plant and out of plant.
 Use of suitable existing designs, from small parts to subsystems.

Systems Analysis and Design Layout

So far, numerous important basic considerations for rocket-engine design have been discussed. The detailed engine-design procedures and the treatment of typical examples as they may occur in practice will now follow. The questions are where to start, how to proceed, and what are the expected results.

46 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

It would be beyond the scope of this book to describe the detailed mechanics of the generation of design drawings, their breakdown, their execution, and the system for their release. The young engineer, who uses this book and already works in industry, knows. The student reader can be assured that the future employer has a manual (usually voluminous)
covering this subject exhaustively, and slanted to his specific needs. The following are specific design techniques as they are used in liquid-propellant en gine design. Many of these techniques will be applied in subsequent chapters, in connection with the discussion and demonstrat ion of various component designs.

The activities discussed below are not clearly separated phases, following one another in a rigid sequence. Rather, they overlap, frequently occur in parallel, and are tightly interwoven. One of the first drawings the liquid-rocket designer will most likely prepare is a schematic diagram of the engine system. A typical example (Fig. 2-20) shows how the principal components are linked together. The schematic may be accompanied by a sequence diagram, showing the operation of each component  in relation to the other as a function of time (Fig. 2-21).

Concurrently, analyses will have been conducted to establish preliminary engine-performance para meters and operating characteristics, as well as individual component configurations and operating principles. Figure 3-1 shows a typical example of a performance diagram. Engine and component start ing and operating characteristics can be analytically predicted with a high degree of accuracy by computers. Thus, important knowledge required for optimum design is obtained long before the part is actually built and tested. Savings in time and cost are substantial. These analyses and computer programs will draw heavily upon experience with earlier systems and on advanced design studies.

Once the prototype schematic diagram is considered completed, and performance parameters have been established by the analysis, the first actual
"engine picture" will be drawn. This very likely will be a general, in-scale preliminary layout of the engine system and components. Figure 3-2 shows a typical example of a preliminary layout.

Through cont inued analyses, calculations, consultations, and joint reviews by all participants, the layout will gradually take final shape. In this process, nothing should be left to chance. Consul tations with specialists in their fields and rigorous calculations, double-checked for accuracy and presented in a readily understood form, will con tribute materially. Layout drawings should be made accurately and to true scale. In this manner, all components of the engine system will have been designed and optimized for one another, rather than
"hung on a mounting frame in Christmas-tree fashion."

ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 47

Before working drawings are made from the layouts, they should again be reviewed and revised as necessary,  taking into considerat ion all design aspects, the basic considerations, and the reliability assurance aspectsthat were discussed here.

Stress Analysis

Stringent reliability and weight requirements call for rigorous and complete stress analyses during the mechanical design of engine components.  Stress analyses predict the manner in which a mechanical part will likely fail under  anticipated working conditions. They also generate means to prevent failure. The goal is to design a part with sufficient, but not excessive, strength in every detail.

In conjunction with the engine design layouts, the approximate shape of the parts will be established, based on functional requirements and on similar satisfactory designs of the past.

First, a preliminary design sketch is made. Subsequently, probable working loads, environmental effects, deflections, stresses, and final dimensions will be determined, step by step, together with the selection of materials. The following steps are typical for stress analyses:

determined:

A part will have a proper  margin of safety if it is designed with a design limit load larger than the maximum expected working load. The design limit load in turn should be smaller than the calculated damaging loads because of the uncertainty and inac curacy involved in stress analyses. Damaging loads include endurance  limit load, yield load, and ultimate load. The more accurate the analysis, the

 Evaluate the various possible modes of part limit loads, and the damaging loads (yield and failure from stress and strain induced within the ultimate loads), plus proof-testing loads applied to part by the working loads and from other effects, component design, can be defined as follows:

 Select the materials and establish their me chanical properties under anticipated working conditions. Applying a likely theory of failure, arrive at the final dimensions of the part.

 Apply experimental stress analyses to refine the above procedure. Redesign the part if necessary. In certain cases, such as with highly stressed lightweight members, further stress-analysis refine ment must be obtained. The greater the refinement w h e r e ~
desired, the more nearly the methods of stress analysis must indicate the true strength of the member. This requires consideration of complex states of stress, residual stresses, stress concentrations, dynamic effects, inelastic effects, and other influences which determine the true stresses within the member. Here follows discussion of the four steps of stress analysis just enumerated.

Working Loads and Environmental Effects. In stress analyses for mechanical design, working loads and environmental effects should be consid ered jointly. Stresses and strains induced in mechan ical parts by external forces, which we will call
"loads," are affected significantly by environmental effects such as temperature,  chemical reactions, corrosion, etc. Furthermore, the mechanical proper ties of most materials are affected by temperature. Sometimes, thermal stresses are induced as a result of temperature gradients within the part. Chemical reactions or corrosion can change the mechanical properties of the material, as well as the size and shape of the part. For the analysis of working loads and environmental effects, the following must be

 Design limit load; select the largest of the following:

1.2 x load (A)
1.2 x load (B)
1.1 x load (C)
1.0 x load (D)

(2-4)

Load (A) = Working load under normal steady operating conditions.

Load (B) = Working load under normal transient operating conditions, such as during normal engine start and stop.

Load (C) = Working load under occasional transient operat ing conditions, such as load during irregular starts.

Load (D) = Mandatory malfunction load that must be taken into account. For example, in a clustered en gine configuration, certain mount members may carry the greatest load when one engine ceases to fire while the others are still op erating (engine-out capability). In cer ta in  ins tances  it is mandatory  that an individual rocket engine continue to op erate when a given component fails. If this causes significant

Yield load: the load that will induce a stress equal to the yield strength of the material used under rated ambient  conditions. Yield load = 1.1 design limit load (2-5)

Ultimate load: the load that will induce a stress equal  to the ultimate s t rength of the material used under rated ambient conditions. Ultimate load = 1.5 x design limit load (2-6)

 Proof-test load: the load applied to test the part during the acceptance inspection. Its value can be adjusted for material propert ies  if the rated ambient conditions cannot be duplicated for the test.

Proof-test load = 1.0 x design-limit load (2-7)

When a part is subjected to an indefinite number of cycles during service life, such as in rotating machinery,  the endurance limit of a material should be appl ied instead of the ult imate strength. The endurance limit is the stress which can be repeated an infinite number  of times without  causing failure of the material from progressive fracture or fatigue. The endurance  limit of metals, depend ing  largely on range of stress variation, runs as low as 20-60% of ul t imate strength in tension. An additional design margin of safety should also be allowed for dynamic impact  loads. When the shape  of a part changes abruptly, as with a groove, a notch, a hole, or small section joining a large one, the value of unit stress at points close to the abrupt change  or discontinuity increases steeply. Stress increase generally ranges from 100 to 300% of the mean stress in the section.

Evaluation o f  fa i lure  modes.  There are three basic types of failure mode:  elastic deflection, p e r m a n e n t  plast ic  de fo rma t ion ,  and fracture. Although not a material failure, elastic deflection may cause a part to perform improperly, resulting in malfunction of a component  or system. The other two--plas t ic  deformation and fracture--are material failures influenced by material properties, load and



ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 49

environmental conditions, and by the shape of the part.

Each of the three failure modes is characterized by certain criteria. For elastic deflection, strain; for plastic deformation and fracture, stress. In the process of stress analyses, following load deter mination, the possible modes of failure of the part can be established in relation to the criteria induced by the loads. Failure cause can thus be determined, and the failure prevented through design changes. Some of the possible combinations of failure modes and criteria are listed in Table 2-8 together with suggested design remedies.

Selection o f  Materials  and  Dimensions.  For the process of finalizing the dimensions of a part to endure all working loads and environmental conditions without failure, the strength or ability of the selected material to withstand these loads must be known. Material properties are determined through tests of specimens. In these tests, all conceivable loads, such as tension, compression, torsion, and shear, are applied often with simul taneous application of temperature, vibration, or chemical environment. The results are compiled in graphs and tables. From these tables, materials with properties most suitable for a particular application can be selected.

Exper imenta l  Stress  Analyses .  A rocket-en gine part may be of such shape, or may be loaded in such a way, that design based on theoretical analysis alone proves difficult and unreliable. Then experimental stress analyses can supplement the theoretical methods. Many recent advances in stress analysis can be attributed to the development of effective experimental methods. Measurements of strains and stresses will be made while applying loads simulating as closely as possible the ones expected in actual use. These loads can be applied to full-size prototype parts, to scale models made from the real material or from special plastic material, or to portions of full-scale parts. Not infrequently, applied loads are intentionally increased beyond rated levels, until failure of the part occurs. These "tests to failure"
can establish the actual margin of safety achieved in the design. The tools used in experimental stress analysis include electrical, mechanical, and optical strain gages and photoelastic plastic models, lacquers, and paints.

Selection of materials for liquid-propellant rocket engines is complicated by the extreme environ mental conditions these materials must withstand.

ENGINE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN ANALYSES 51

The low temperatures encountered when in contact with cryogenic liquids introduce severe toughness and ductility problems with metals and non-metals alike. On the other hand, metals which contact the hot exhaust gases must be capable of resisting creep and stress rupture at elevated temperatures. Table 2-9
summarizes some examples of materials and their usage.

Both hydrogen and oxygen can precipitate catastrophic failures of many materials. Hydrogen environment embrittlement (HEE) will occur when a susceptible metal undergoes strain in the presence of gaseous hydrogen.  Most metals suffer greatest susceptibility near ambient temperature; below 200F most metals become immune to HEE. However, consideration must be given to start-up and shut down conditions because even a short-term exposure to warm hydrogen could cause embri t t lement . Metals which are most susceptible to HEE include martensit ic steels, nickel and nickel alloys, and titanium alloys.

Contact of many metals and nonmetals  with oxygen can result in spontaneous ignition. Metals which cannot be used with liquid or gaseous oxygen include titanium and magnesium. Caution must be exercised when using aluminum in high-pressure oxygen (LOX or GOX), particularly in applications when rubbing or particle impingement  may occur. Most nonmetallics are not compatible with oxygen systems. Fluorocarbons such as Teflon and Kel-F exhibit limited compatibil i ty but must be batch tested before use.

Corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
must be considered when  selecting materials for liquid-propellant rocket engines. Many propellants and exhaust gases are corrosive to metals, therefore compatibilities must be determined on an individual, case-by-case basis. Also, metals must withstand severe ambient environments during storage. Alloy steels, magnesium alloys, and high-strength alum inum alloys are generally unsuitable unless they are protected from the environment. Likewise, SCC must be considered when selecting metals for engine ap plication. Alloys with low resistance to SCC include alloy steels heat-treated to high strength, precip i tat ion-hardening stainless steels in high-strength conditions, and high-strength aluminum alloys in the-T6 temper.

Finally, the behavior of metals under the vacuum conditions in space must be considered. Metals with low vapor pressure, such as cadmium, will vaporize and could redeposit on other surfaces. Also, metal whiskers can grow on many metals, causing "shorting"
of electronic components and switches.

The materials most commonly  used in liquid propellant  rocket engines,  and their abilities to withstand the aforementioned environmental condi tions, are described in more detail in Appendix C.

Introduction to Sample Calculations

3.1 APPROACH

A primary goal of this b o o k - - t o  familiarize the reader with the detailed techniques used by industry in l iquid-propel lant  rocket  engine systems and component  design--has  engendered a set of realistic sample calculations. To promote an understanding of the interrela t ionship among  major subsys tems, principal calculations have been made for the en gines of a hypothetical  multistage space vehicle. These calculations and their associated designs were especially prepared for this book and are not related to existing or planned engines. Because the various subsystems of liquid-propellant rocket engines will be discussed in subsequen t  chapters,  most  of the supporting sample calculations throughout the book, will be for the engines of the assumed vehicle. For simplicity of reference, the space vehicle will be called Alpha. It will be composed of four stages: A-l, A-2, A-3, and A-4. Table 3-1 lists the major parameters of the Alpha.

The Alpha vehicle combines realistic designs, even though not necessarily optimized. For instance, a different propellant combination has been chosen for each stage to permit sample calculations and designs for a number  of typical propellant combina tions, feed systems, and thrust levels. To permit multiple use of parts, fewer combinations would be chosen. In fact, the student and the teacher using this book may find it interesting and instructive to modify the designs chosen. For instance, the student may wish to determine what  engine-design parameters would result if Stages A-2 and A-3 were to use the same propel lan t  combinat ion;  or what  design parameters would be obtained if Stages A-3 and A-4
were combined into one stage, capable of restart and throttling to 30% nominal thrust.

It is not our intent to fix a specific mission for Alpha. However, a "primary mission" for it could be the landing of an unmanned  scientific payload on the Moon to gather samples and return them to Earth. The staging sequence might then be as follows:

Stage A-l: Boost to 250,000-ft altitude. Stage A-2: Boost to 300-n.mi altitude and inject into Earth parking orbit. Stage A-3: Accelerate to escape velocity and inject into a translunar trajectory. Stage A-4: First s ta r t - -dece le ra t ion  for lunar orbit and soft Moon landing of sci entific payload; second s tar t - -Moon takeoff  for return to Earth. In addition to its main power  plant, Stage A-4 will require very low-thrust attitude control jets.

Even if designed for a given "primary mission," a vehicle combinat ion retains a certain degree  of

aConsisting of stages 3 and 4 and of the mission payload flexibility. Within the limits of existing propellant tank configurations, the following principal possibil ities of modification exist:

 Omission of the upper two stages for Earth-or bital tankers,  shuttle vehicles, space-stat ion assembly, and supply ships.

 Omission of Stage A-4 for unmanned deep-space probe assignments, with no return intended.

 Off-nominal tanking of one or more stages. This modification may yield some overall perfor mance gains for special missions. Most emphatically, it is not our intent to say that the stated modifications can be made a few days before launch. Rather, the stages and certain of their subsystems m in particular, the engines - -  should be regarded as building blocks. Their availability can permit meeting a new requirement, for example, within a year, as compared to several years when
"starting from scratch." In such ways, substantial gains have been obtained in practice. The earlier Thor, Redstone, and Atlas Mercury boosters are well-known cases.

Brief mention should be made here of experi mental engine systems, sometimes referred to as
"breadboard" engines. Because of time and funding limitations, the design and development  of liquid propellant rocket engines for a given mission rarely permit the investigation of novel ideas and princi ples. New ideas must then be tried independently, detached from rigid schedules. Here, the test effort can be conducted with full awareness that many of the principles under investigation will not "make the grade." However, although those that succeed can be appl ied to advanced  operat ional  systems, the marginal ones are just as valuable, because they were prevented from finding their way into operational engines. If experimental ly  verified advances are selected for operational use with strong emphasis on vehicle application, true progress will have been

The reader will now become acquainted with some of the characteristics of the engines which have been selected for the different stages of the Alpha vehicle. The summarizing descriptions can serve as a guide and reference throughout the book.

3.2 A-1 STAGE ENGINE

Four engines, each with 750,000-1b thrust, were se lected for a combined thrust of 3-million lb, as a compromise between the number of engine systems, and thus complexity, on the one hand, and flexibility, on the other. Flexibility can be gained in different ways, such as including engine-out capabilities using

smaller systems or designs already in existence and implementing various guidance (gimballing) and packaging considerations.

The propellant combination of liquid oxygen
(LOX) and kerosene-type RP-1 fuel was selected for the A-1 engine, principally because high perfor mance will not be as critical for booster first stages as for upper  stages. Moreover, both propellants are abundantly available and comparatively inexpensive;
the fluids and their combust ion products are
"docile"; their corrosivity is nil. Both fluids are rela tively dense. Liquid-propellant rocket engine systems using these propellants are well developed and re liable, and thus many "off the shelf" components and designs are available for them.

General Engine-System Description

The A-1 engine is a single-start, fixed-thrust, gim balled, bipropellant system. The fuel, RP-1, is also used as the turbopump lubricant and as the engine control-system actuating fluid. The major compo nents of the A-1 engine are a regeneratively-fuel cooled, double-pass, tubular-wall thrust chamber with bolt-on injector; a direct-drive turbopump consisting of two centrifugal pumps and a single-stage, two-wheel turbine; an uncooled gas generator with a dual-ball valve; butterfly main valves; and the required con trois. The gas generator uses the same propellant combination as the thrust chamber. Table 3-2 pre sents all necessary operating parameters on which engine component designs will be based for the A-1
engine system.

Figure 3-1 shows the A-1 engine schematic, which identifies clearly all major engine components and their interconnecting plumbing. For the various phases of engine design and development, it has been found useful to work from an "engine-perfor mance diagram," a combination of the basic engine schematic and the principal performance para meters. The A-1 engine diagram is shown in Fig. 3-1.
(We suggest that the readers prepare their own performance diagrams for the other three stages.)

For compactness and simplicity of mounting, the turbopump is attached directly to the thrust chamber. All other components either are mounted on these two assemblies or are located in the plumbing system between them. This arrangement permits engine gimballing without pump-discharged, high-pressure propellant-duct flexure. Instead, thrust-vector control is achieved by gimballing the entire engine. The engine weighs approximately 7500 lb dry, 7900 lb wet, and 7830 lb at burnout. The preliminary design lay out of the A-1 engine system and its overall dimen sions are presented in Fig. 3-2.

System Operation

For starting, the A-1 engine employs a "main-tank head start" approach, combined with a pressure ladder sequence. Propellants are used under vehicle tank-head pressures to initiate gas-generator op eration. As the turbopump starts to accelerate, main propel lant  pressures "bootstrap" the system to mainstage level.

Starting sequence. As shown in Figs. 2-20 and
2-21 (pages 45 and 46), launch preparations com pleted and the main propellant tanks pressurized, the gas-generator's dual spark plugs are activated upon a given signal, and the engine four-way control valve is energized to open. The closing side is vented, and fuel-pump outlet pressure (50 psia from tank head) is admitted to the opening side of the main oxidizer and the gas-generator valve actuators. The gas generator valves open and admit both propellants to the gas-generator combustor, where they are ignited by the spark plugs. At this point, the main oxidizer valve remains closed; the valve spring prevents it from opening until later in the sequence, when substantially higher actuating fuel pressures are developed by the pump.

The initial, low power level of the gas generator is sufficient to start and accelerate the turbopump. This acceleration, in turn, increases the propellant pres sures available to the gas generator, which is con nected upstream of the still-closed main fuel and oxidizer valves. As a result, the gas-generator turbine system "bootstraps" itself.

At a predetermined fuel-pump outlet pressure
(valve-spring rate selection), the main oxidizer valve opens. During the oxidizer-valve stroke, an integral and mechanically linked igniter fuel-sequence valve is actuated. The sequence valve then admits pres surized fuel to a hypergol igniter cartridge, rupturing its diaphragms. Hypergol (such as triethylaluminum)
enters the combustion-chamber igniter elements and ignites with the oxidizer (which is just being admitted by the main oxidizer valve). The fuel following the hypergol sustains the igniter flame.

The chamber pressure which results from igniter combustion is sufficient to actuate the ignition monitor valve. This valve admits fuel pressure to the actuator that opens the main fuel valve, the last step in the sequence .  As the main fuel enters the combustion chamber, the chamber pressure and thrust climb to the rated level.

Cutoff sequence. As shown in Figs. 2-20 and 2 21, a cutoff signal de-energizes, and thus closes the engine four-way control valve. The opening pressures of all valves vent; the valves close. Turbine power and main-chamber pressure decay. While the main propellant tanks vent, all valves are held in the closed position by springs. Note that the gas generator valve and the main oxidizer valve are closed by admitting actuation pressure to their closing port, but the main fuel valve is closed by spring force only. Experience has shown that cutoff precision is largely influenced by turbopump decay characteristics and by cessation of the propellant flow that has the smallest duct volume below the v a l v e -  in this case, the oxidizer (with no cooling jacket). The fast-closing valves need some timing, however, to control pressures caused by wat erhammer effects.

3.3 A-2 STAGE ENGINE

For the same reasons as with the first stage, the A-2
will have clustered (four) engines, delivering vacuum thrust of 600,000 lb (150,000 lb per engine). Because

have been selected as propellants.

Over the years, the production and handling of the cryogenics liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen have become routine; and the price has come down considerably. Both elements are abundantly avail able. Their combustion p r o d u c t -  water v a p o r -  is the most harmless of all propellant exhausts, solid or liquid. Telemetry engineers like it because of its low attenuation of RF signals, an important aspect for vehicle guidance and telemetry. Most important, the yield in specific impulse of this combination ap proaches theoretical maximum for chemical reac tions. Only certain fluorine/hydrogen combinations are slightly higher (approximately 4%). (The extreme toxicity of fluorine and fluorine compounds, both as liquids and as components of combustion products, makes fluorine less attractive for operational use.) By building the A-1 and A-2 stages a little larger, the same payload that fluorine offers can be obtained.

Moreover, all the advantages of LOX/LH2 are re tained, including the extensive past experience with them.

Even so, hydrogen does have its drawbacks, the principal one being its low density, resulting in rather bulky tanks, which make it an unattractive candidate for first-stage/booster applications in most cases. For a typical oxygen-to-hydrogen mixture ratio of 5:1, the corresponding volume ratio is inversed: 1:5. This disadvantage, however, will be offset for upper stages by the high-energy yield (Is). The improved state of the art of ultralightweight vehicle and tank construc tions will further increase the superiority of hydrogen for upper stages.

Low density also creates a high boiloff rate, un less tanks and lines are properly insulated. Because of the low density and the resulting large surface area of the containers, the heat input per unit of hydrogen mass is high. Furthermore, the temperature of liquid hydrogen is sufficiently low to liquefy air on tank surfaces. This liquefaction sharply increases heat transfer rates, resulting in extreme boiloff rates. Tank and-line insulation, therefore, is vital. Although the techniques of rocket-vehicle insulation are highly de veloped, the necessary insulation does impose some weight penalties.

Overall, however, hydrogen produces a substan tial net performance gain for upper stages.

General Engine-System Description The A-2 engine is a single-start, fixed-thrust, gim balled, bipropellant system. The thrust chamber fea tures a combination of fuel regenerative cooling and film cooling with turbine exhaust gas. The chamber assembly is fed by two independent, direct-drive centrifugal turbopumps. For the fuel, an alternative axial pump may be chosen. Each operates at opti mum speed. Hot gases are tapped off the main com bustion chamber to power the turbines. A hot-gas orifice in the tapoff duct controls the engine thrust level. The turbines, gas-coupled in parallel, exhaust to the thrust chamber, being injected in the 30:l expansion-area-ratio plane. Thus, the gases provide film cooling for the nozzle portion and from there to the 40:l-area-ratio plane. The remainder of the chamber, upstream of the 30:1 plane, is regenerative ly cooled (1 1/2 pass). Helium gas actuates the con trois. No lubricants and no fluids that could freeze at low temperatures are used. Hot gases generated by a solid-propellant turbine spinner start the engine. Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) , hypergolic with LH2, ignites the combustion chamber. The turbine spinner and igniter fluid are both insulated and temperature conditioned electrically from a ground source until first-stage takeoff. Gaseous hydrogen bled from the thrust-chamber coolant passage pressurizes the main fuel tank. A small portion of liquid oxygen, bled from the oxidizer-pump discharge and heated in a heat exchanger, pressurizes the main oxidizer tank.

Table 3-3 lists the A-2 engine operating parame ters. The engine schematic diagram appears in Fig. 3 3. Note that engine parameters are based on v a c u u m condi t ionsubecause  A-2 starts and operates in a vacuum for its entire duration. In the case of the A-2
Stage, the starting altitude of 250,000 ft can be considered absolute vacuum, for all practical pur poses.

Gimballing the entire engine applies TVC. The engine weighs approximately 2181 lb dry, 2317 lb wet, and 2292 lb at burnout. The overall dimensions and the preliminary design layout of the A-2 engine are shown in Fig. 3-4.

System Operation The A-2 engine (Fig. 3-3 and 3-5) employs a "turbine spin start" for very fast buildup (less than 2 s from start signal to main stage). Starting power is furnished by a turbine spinner. Chamber tapoff gases then bootstrap the turbine.

Starting Sequence As part of the separation and staging sequence, a vehicle programmer furnishes a start signal (to the engine) that ignites the turbine spinner, which supplies gases at 2000"F to the turbines and combus tion chamber. This signal also energizes the solenoid of the engine control valve that vents the closing side of both main propel lant-valve actuators and

pressurizes the opening side of the fuel-valve actuator with helium gas. Simultaneously, the hypergol sequence valve (mechanically linked to the main fuel valve), is opened and the actuator of the (normally open) fuel-bleed valve is pressurized closed. The fuel flows through the chamber cooling jacket under increasing pump-discharge pressure and injects into the combustion chamber. Ignition is achieved by the hypergolic reaction between hydrogen and the slug of chlorine trifluoride forced into the chamber by increased oxidizer-pump discharge pressure.

When the main fuel valve reaches the 90%-open position, ports open that are integral with the actu ating piston and permit helium gas to flow through the hypergol-monitor valve and to pressurize the open side of the main oxidizer-valve actuator. The main oxidizer valve opens, admitting oxidizer to the chamber where pressure builds up rapidly. Chamber tapoff gases bootstrap the turbines to mainstage operation. The spinner burns for about 1.2 s. After the main stage level is achieved, the propel-lant-uti lization servo system begins to function.

Cutoff Sequence

The cutoff signal, received from the vehicle programmer, de-energizes the engine-control valve causing it to close. This closure vents the open side and pressurizes the closing side of the main propel lant-valve actuators. By proper orificing of the he lium lines, the main oxidizer valve is made to close faster than the main fuel valve, to ensure a fuel-rich cutoff. The valve closure causes engine thrust to de cay. The fuel bleed valve opens after venting of the helium pressure in its actuator.

3.4 A-3 STAGE ENGINE

Three engines of 16,000-1b thrust each power the A-3
Stage. They employ liquid fluorine and liquid hy drogen as propellants to gain the very high perfor mance required of upper stages. To date, there have been almost no applications of fluorine as a propel lant except on an experimental basis. Fluorine has vigorous and reliable hypergolic ignition and super ior specific impulse with most fuels. The high density of liquid fluorine, combined with high performance with liquid hydrogen, results in maximum payloads. It

General Engine-System Description

The A-3 engine is a multiple-start, gimballed, bipro pellant system. The thrust chamber uses a combina tion of fuel-film (LH2) and radiation cooling. The propellants are fed directly from pressurized pro pellant tanks, through main propellant valves, to thrust-chamber inlets. The propellant tanks and their gas pressurization system are considered part of the engine propellant-feed system. Gaseous helium, supplied from a high-pressure helium bottle located inside the main fuel tank, pressurizes the main oxi dizer tank. The main fuel tank is pressurized by gaseous hydrogen, supplied from a liquid-hydrogen bottle pressurized by helium; it is located inside the main fuel tank. Both pressurants are heated in heat exchangers, located at the thrust-chamber nozzle extensions, before being expanded through pressure regulators and transferred to the propellant tanks. Helium gas operates the main valves and the gimbal actuators and purges the propellant manifolds during the hypergolic start.

Table 3-4 lists A-3 engine operating parameters for vacuum conditions. Figure 3-6 shows the propul sion system schematic diagram.

The highly reactive and toxic nature of fluorine forces simplicity and a minimum number of com ponents in design of the entire propulsion system. Welded joints are used extensively. No rotating seals are employed; sliding seals, the metal-bellows type.

A preliminary design layout of the A-3 propul sion system and its dimensions are depicted in Fig. 3 7. The fuel tank is pressure- rather than mechanically stabilized. The thrust loads are transmitted to the payload through the fuel tank. Both tanks are in sulated, along with the ducts between tanks and en gine systems. Gimballing the thrust chambers applies TVC. Each basic engine weighs approximately 330 lb dry and 365 lb at burnout. Each has a cylindrical space envelope of 5 ft 4 in. in diam by 7 ft 6 in. in length. The propulsion system (including the three engines and the tankage) weighs approximately 5130
lb dry, 37,900 lb wet, and 5530 lb at burnout.

System Operation

The A-3 propulsion system is designed for automatic start on receiving a signal from the guidance system. A similar signal starts automatic engine shutdown. One or more restarts can be made by merely send ing additional start/shutdown signals to the propul sion system. Figure 3-8 shows the operational se quence of the A-3 engine stage. In conjunction with Fig. 3-6, this figure illustrates the startup and shutdown of the system.

3.5 A-4 STAGE ENGINE

The A-4 stage employs two engines, each of 7500-1b thrust, to achieve a desired thrust of 15,000 lb. It is as

sumed that the mission assigned to this fourth (and last) stage of the space vehicle may require prolonged cruising periods before ignition and possibly even longer waiting periods before re-igni tion. Although it would be desirable to utilize the high-energy propellants of the second and third stages, the fact that they are cryogenics poses some problems. Cryogenic propellants could probably be used with refined insulation techniques, but they were not selected because the increase in complexity
(resulting from the insulation techniques) was deemed inappropriate for a vehicle of this size. Solid propellants were also ruled out because of the requirement for repeated starts and throttling.

Storable hypergolics possess certain character istics that contribute to high reliability--such as simplicity of ignition and ease of propellant main tenance (because the propellants can be contained in closed vessels over reasonable temperature ranges for considerable periods of time without developing excessively high pressures or undergoing unac ceptable changes in composition). Applicable stor ables with high performance include chlorine trifluo ride (CIF3)/hydrazine (N2H4) and nitrogen tetroxide
(N204)/N2H 4. As a monopropellant, hydrazine is prone to explosive thermal decomposition, but this condition can be remedied by certain additives. The CIF3/N2H 4 produces slightly higher performance

Teflon and Teflon 100X can be used as seal ma terial in the A-4 engine system. Although KeI-F is a satisfactory material for use with N2H4, it degrades after short-term service in N204. Most series 300 stain less steels, aluminum alloys, nickel, and nickel-base brazing alloys can be used as construction materials.

General Engine System

The A-4 engine is a multiple-start, variable-thrust, gimballed, bipropellant system. The thrust-chamber assembly employs ablative and radiation cooling and undergoes hypergolic ignition. This engine sys tem links two thrust chambers to one propellant-feed system and one set of propellant controls. The propellants are fed by pressurants directly from the propellant tanks through the main propellant valves to thrust-chamber inlets. Gaseous helium supplied from high-pressure bottles pressurizes both tanks. The pressurant is heated in heat exchangers, located at the thrust-chamber nozzle extensions before ex pansion through a pressure regulator and transferred to the propellant tanks. Helium gas also operates the main valves and the gimbal actuators.

Table 3-5 gives A-4 engine operating parameters at vacuum condition. Figure 3-9 shows an engine and propulsion system schematic diagram.

Fig. 3-11 A-4 Stage engine operational sequence.

The engine gimbal blocks are fastened to thrust mounts attached to the aft end of the oxidizer tank. The fuel tank is attached forward of the oxidizer tank to form an integral vehicle structure. As in the A-3
system, the thrust loads are transmitted to the pay load through the pressure-stabilized tank assembly. The propellant ducts between fuel tank and engine systems are routed outboard and covered by fairings for protection against aerodynamic heating and for lower air resistance during first-stage boost.

Both throttling and propellant-utilization control are achieved by varying the degree of opening of both propellant valves. The positions of valves are controlled by the vehicle guidance system in con junction with a vehicle propellant-quantity measuring system. Gimballing the thrust chambers applies TVC. The basic single engine weighs approximately 150 lb dry and 170 lb at burnout. It has a cylindrical space envelope of 3 ft 6 in. in diam by 5 ft 9 in. in length. The complete propulsion system (including the two engines and the tanks) weighs approximately 725 lb dry, 19,649 lb wet, and 795 lb at burnout. Figure 3-10

shows the preliminary design layout of the A-4
propulsion system.

Note that for the A-3 and A-4 engines, a slightly smaller nozzle expansion area ratio has been speci fied than for the A-2. Although all three upper stages operate in vacuum and can use the largest practical expansion area ratio for best performance, other considerations influence the ratio actually chosen.

System Operation

The propulsion system has been designed to start automatically upon a signal from the guidance sys tem. During main-stage operation, engine's thrust level and mixture ratio will be controlled continu ously through the engine-control package by the guidance and propellant-utilization systems. A guid ance signal shuts the engine down. The propulsion system can restart an indefinite number of times. It can be operated at any level between 10% and full thrust. Figure 3-11 shows the operational sequence of the A-4 Stage engine.



Chapter 4

Des ign  of  Thrust Chambers  and Other Combust ion  Devices

While each of the proud designers of the various subsystems of a rocket engine considers his product as "the heart of the engine," the thrust-chamber assembly undeniably embodies the essence of rocket propulsion: the acceleration and ejection of matter, the reaction to which imparts propulsive force to the vehicle. The designer aims to achieve this with a device of maximum performance, stability, and dura bility and minimum size, weight, and cost.

The design of a thrust chamber presents one of the more complex tasks in the field of liquid-propel lant rocket engineering, primarily because the basic processes, especially the combustion within the thrust chamber, are imperfectly understood. This makes analyses difficult and imprecise. Thus, during most engine-development programs, a major effort must be expended on design and development of the thrust chamber.

4.1 BASIC THRUST-CHAMBER ELEMENTS

The thermodynamic processes governing the gener ation of thrust within a chamber have been treated in Chapter 1. In a liquid-bipropellant rocket engine, the following basic steps characterize the conversion of the energy of propellants into thrust:

1) The liquid propellants, at proper oxidizer/
fuel mixture ratio (O/F), are injected into the com bustion chamber and atomized into droplets.

2) The droplets are subsequently vaporized by heat transfer from the surrounding gas. The size and velocity of the droplets change continuously during their entrainment in the combustion-gas flow.

3) The vaporized propellants are mixed rapidly, further heated, and promptly react, thus continuously increasing gaseous mass flowrate within the corn bustion chamber. This gas-phase reaction is aided by high-speed diffusion of active molecules and atoms. Combustion will essentially be complete up stream of the chamber throat, when all liquid drop lets have been vaporized. Under certain conditions, shock and detonation waves may be generated by local disturbances in the chamber, possibly caused by fluctuations in mixing or propellant flow. These may trigger pressure oscillations that are amplified and maintained by the combustion processes. Such high-amplitude waves--referred to as "combustion instability"--produce high levels of vibration and heat flux that can be very destructive. A major por tion of the design and development effort therefore concerns stable combustion.

4) As the gaseous products of the combustion process pass toward and through the throat, they are accelerated to sonic, and then to supersonic, velocity

Within the diverging nozzle section, and are finally ejected.

The basic elements of a thrust chamber include a combustion chamber, expansion nozzle, injector, ig nition device (for nonhypergolic propellants), pro pellant inlet and distribution manifolds, and appro priate surfaces and structures for component mount ing and for carrying the thrust forces to the vehicle.

Figures 4-1 and 4-2 illustrate a thrust-chamber as sembly that typifies those employed for relatively low chamber pressure (<1000 psia) and liquid oxygen/
RP-1 propellants. This assembly has three major subassemblies: thrust-chamber body (which includes the expansion nozzle), injector, and igniter. In some cases, particularly for larger engines, the nozzle may be a separate piece that attaches to the thrust-cham ber body at some small distance beyond the throat.

The thrust-chamber body subassembly, a venturi shape, consists of a cylindrical section in which the combustion occurs, a section narrowing toward a throat, and a bell-shaped, expanding nozzle section through which the combustion gases are expelled. The wall of this chamber is constructed of nickel tubes running longitudinally, joined by silver brazing, and retained by external tension bands. The tubes, of 0.012-in. wall thickness, have rectangular cross section of varying area, to conform to the thrust chamber shape. This construction permits simple thrust-chamber cooling by flowing fuel through the tubes of the chamber wall. The fuel, under pressure, enters the thrust-chamber body at the fuel-manifold

It then moves down toward the nozzle exit where the fuel-return manifold reverses the flow into the return tubes. The fuel then flows through an injector fuel screen, and into the injector. To meet conditions of high heat flux (e.g., LOX/hydrogen combustion at high chamber pressure), the chamber will usually be constructed from a single solid piece of highly conductive material containing many small slots (coolant-flow passages) within the wall, instead of tubes.

Following are the operating characteristics and principal dimensions of a hypothetical thrust chamber similar to the one shown in Fig. 4-1:

High-strength bolts hold the thrust-chamber in jector (Fig. 4-2)ma round plate honeycombed with circular and radial inner passages~ which lead to drilled injection orifices--in position at the fuel manifold, below the liquid-oxygen dome. The seals between the injector and thrust-chamber bodies are of the O-ring type, made of material selected for compatibility with the fuel. A mount in the center of the injector permits installation of a pyrotechnic ig niter. The injector has 20 circular concentric copper rings that contain the injection orifices. Fuel and oxidizer are kept separate by an elaborate distri bution system feeding alternate rings. Fuel flows through the outermost ring, through each alternate inner ring, and through a central fuel disk separately fed from an igniter fuel valve through an ignition fuel-inlet port. Liquid oxygen is supplied to the re maining rings. The injection orifices are angled so that the propellant streams impinge upon each other in the thrust chamber, in a like-on-like pattern (i.e., LOX on LOX and fuel on fuel). The primary orifices are arranged in pairs, with 0.416 in. between center lines and a 40-deg included impingement angle, for both propellants.

The liquid-oxygen dome provides the inlet for the liquid oxygen. It also serves as the thrust-cham ber-to-vehicle attachment interface. The electrically fired pyrotechnic igniter is mounted at the center of the injector.

Injector design, particularly selection of the number, size, and location of orifices, will be cru cially important to the performance and stability
(and often thrust-chamber-wall heat flux) of the en gine. In addition to the like-impinging doublet ele ments described above, the injector may also em ploy unlike impingement and multiple (more than two) stream impingements. Finally, liquid/gas pro pellant combinations will usually employ coaxial injection elements in which the gaseous fuel (e.g., hydrogen or methane) in the annulus atomizes the liquid (e.g., LOX) in the central stream.

4.2 THRUST-CHAMBER PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS

The significance of the parameters that express or influence the efficiency of thrust-chamber operation has been discussed in section 1.3 of Chapter 1. Before discussing the details of actual thrust-chamber design, the parameters will be summarized here and their use illustrated for design calculations, by applying them to the engine systems of the Alpha vehicle discussed in Chapter 3.

The Is figure indicates the overall quality of the thrust-chamber design, showing the level of thrust generated per "running propellant expenditure."

Characterist ic  Velocity  c* ( f t /s)

From Eq. 1-32a:

c* = f(7, R, (Tc)ns) (4-1)

Assuming that the propellant and mixture-ratio selections have been made, it can be expected that the gas properties (T,R) will fall into a known band. From there on, c* almost entirely depends on the temperature of the gases. Obviously, this temperature has a theoretical maximum for a selected propellant combination. How close to this maximum the cham ber will operate depends on influences discussed for mixture ratio in Chapter 2. Figures 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, and
4-6 illustrate this. The c* peaks at combustion temperatures somewhat lower than maximum. Other considerations, such as bulk densities, which affect vehicle tank sizes, may cause further adjustments of the mixture ratio to gain optimum overall vehicle performance. Within these boundaries, the quality of the combustion process greatly depends on the design efficiency of the thrust-chamber assembly, in particular, the injector.

Thrust  Coeff ic ient  Cf ( d i m e n s i o n l e s s )

From Eq. 1-33a:

Ce = R'7, e, P,) (4-2)

Assume that the performance efficiency of energy generation through the combustion process, the effects of which have just been summarized for c*, has been determined. Then, with a given gas prop erty 7, the performance efficiency of the remaining thrust-generating functions of the thrust chamber, essentially those of the divergent nozzle, will depend on the nozzle geometry (mainly 8, which determines the pressure ratio pe/(pc)ns and the ambient pres sure (Pa).

Per formance  Calculat ion

In design practice, the calculation of thrust-chamber performance is based on theoretical propellant combustion data and the application of certain correction factors, as explained in Chapter 1. The theoretical propellant combustion data are derived from thermochemical computations which equate the heat of reaction of the propellant combination to the rise in enthalpy of the combustion gases. Typical propellant combustion data at frozen composition are presented in Fig. 4-3 through 4-6. For given propellant combinations and chamber-nozzle stagna tion pressures (Pc)ns, the values of the combustion gas temperature (Tc)ns, molecular weight M, and spe cific heat ratio T are plotted against the O/F mixture ratio rw. Performance correction factors are deter mined by the theoretical assumptions and from test data, as well as from the chosen design config urations. Typical performance calculation methods have been demonstrated earlier by sample calcu lation (1-3). The following sample calculations il lustrate more specific approaches. Although the fro zen composition curves in Fig. 4.3 to 4.6 are used in these examples, the corresponding equilibrium com position curves are now generally employed.

This value for c* can also be derived from Fig. 4-3. For a good combustion chamber and injector design, the c* correction factor for LO2/RP-1 and frozen composition will be about 0.975.

Design c* = 5810 x 0.975 = 5660 ft/s

For 7 = 1.213 and e = 40, a theoretical vacuum Cf value of 1.876 can be derived from Fig. 1-17. Cfcan also be calculated using equations (1-33a) and (1-20). With effective nozzle-contour design, an overall Cf correction factor value of 1.01 can be used for LO2/LH2 frozen-composition data:

4.3 THRUST-CHAMBER CONFIGURATION LAYOUT

After major thrust-chamber operating parameters such as type of propellant, thrust level, chamber pressure, Cf c*, and Is have been established from engine system requirements and performance calcu lations, one of the fundamental  dimensions of the thrust chamber,  the throat area, can be readily derived (Eq. 1-33). The throat area is usually the starting point of a thrust-chamber configuration lay out. The combustion chamber  and nozzle section are commonly  designed as an integral thrust chamber body. For light weight and ease of manu facture, a thrust chamber will have the general shape of a pressure vessel with wall surfaces of rotation and smooth contours.

C o m b u s t i o n - C h a m b e r  V o l u m e where Vc=chamber  volume, ft~; Wtc=propellant mass flowrate, lb/s; V = average specific volume, ft~/lb;
and ts=propellant  stay-time, s.

A useful parameter relative to chamber volume and residence time is the "characteristic length" (L*, pronounced "L-star")--the chamber volume (in cubic inches) divided by the nozzle sonic throat area (in square inches):

L* _ Vc _ Wtcvts (4-4)
At At

The L* concept is much easier to visualize than the more elusive "combustion residence time," expressed in small fractions of a second. Since the value of A, is in nearly direct proport ion to the product  of Xig,c and V, L" is essentially a function of ts. The effect of L" on c" in an experimental combustion chamber  is shown in Fig.4-7. The c" value increases with L" to an asymp totic maximum. Increasing L" beyond a certain point tends to decrease overall engine system performance because of the following:

 Larger L* results in higher thrust-chamber vol ume and weight.

 Larger L* creates more surface area in need of cooling and may increase thermal losses.

 Larger L* increases the frictional losses in the combustion chamber, reducing nozzle stagnation pressure and resultant thrust.

The customary method of establishing the L* of a new thrust-chamber design largely relies on past ex perience with similar propellants and engine size. Various computer  programs for combustion model ing have provided assistance and guidelines to verify the size selection. Most of these models are based on estimated or assumed propellant drop size; they

The combustion chamber serves as an envelope to retain the propellants for a sufficient period ("stay time") to ensure complete mixing and combustion. The required stay time, or combustion residence time, is a function of many parameters. The rate of combustion is determined by the propellant com bination, the injected conditions of the propellants
(liquid, gas, gel), combustor geometry (contraction ratio, Mach number, turbulence level), and injector design. Rate-limiting factors are vaporization rates for liquid propellants (or surface-regression rates for injected solids), mixing time, and the (seldom limiting) kinetic rates of the reactions. Larger en gines, with their typically larger injection elements, will produce larger drop sizes, extending the time re quired for combustion completion. Combustor vol ume thus has a definite effect on combustion effi ciency.

72 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES include expressions for the rate of vaporization in the combustion environment and predict the rate and degree of combustion completeness. Some of these models have expressions for prediction of mixing effects, but the predictions will be much less reliable than the vaporization/combustion values.

Under a given set of operating conditions, such as type of propellant, mixture ratio, chamber pres sure, injector design, and chamber  geometry, the value of the minimum required L* can only be evaluated by actual firings of experimental  thrust chambers. L* values of about 15 to 120 in. for corres ponding propellant stay times of 0.002 to 0.040 s have been used in various thrust-chamber designs. Typical L* values for various propellants are shown in Table
4-1. With throat area and minimum required L*

While spherical and near-spherical chambers were used in early European designs, the cylindrical cham ber has been employed  most frequently in the United States. Compared to a cylindrical chamber of the same volume,  a spherical or near-spherical chamber offers the advantage of less cooling surface and weight. A sphere has the best surface-to-volume ratio of all the geometric choices, and for the same material strength and chamber pressure, the min imum wall thickness required for pressure loads is about half that of a cylinder. However, the spherical chamber  is more difficult to manufacture and has provided poorer performance in other respects.

Selecting the proportions and size of a new thrust-chamber assembly for specified thrust and chamber  pressure usually appears  to be a rather established, the chamber volume can be calculated arbitrary process. The operating regime (sea level, by Eq. (4-4). vacuum), chamber pressure, and thrust level provide

Combustion-Chamber Shape

As can be seen from Eq. (4-3), the stay time is theoretically independent  of combust ion-chamber geometry. On this purely mathematical basis, for a given required volume, the chamber can have any the desired nozzle area ratio and thrust coefficient for the approximate nozzle, which sets the throat area for the selected engine. The largest remaining gray area thus becomes combustion-chamber sizing. The total combustion process, from injection of the reac tants until completion of the chemical reactions and conversion of the products into hot gases, requires fi shape. In actual design, however, the choice of corn- nite amounts of time and volume, as expressed by bustion chamber  configuration is limited. A long the characteristic length L*. The value of this factor chamber with a small cross section entails high is significantly greater than the linear length between nonisentropic pressure losses, as explained in Chap- injector face and the throat plane. The contraction ter 1. Long chambers also dictate a longer thrust- ratio, which is defined as the major cross-sectional chamber envelope and impose space limitations on area of the combustor (typically in the cylindrical the injector design to accommodate  the desired portion near the injector face)d iv ided  by the throat number of injection elements. With a short chamber area, is basically related to the mean Mach number of large cross section, the propellant atomization and of the combustion gas. vaporization zone occupies a relatively large portion Typically, large engines are constructed with a of the chamber volume, while the mixing and com- low contraction ratio and a comparatively long bustion zone becomes too short for efficient com- length; and smaller chambers employ a large con bustion. Other factors, such as heat transfer, corn- traction ratio with a shorter length, while still bustion stability, weight, and ease of manufacturing, providing sufficient L* for adequate vaporization and must also be considered in determining the final combustion dwell-time. A look at some extreme ex combustion-chamber configuration, amples gives insight into the reasons for this tenden Three geometrical shapes that have been used in combustion-chamber design are shown in Fig. 4-8.

cy. In general, the combustion process is not scale able. Thus, if it is decided to scale down the F-1
engine from 1,500,000 lb of thrust to 100 lb while maintaining the same length and contraction ratio, the 39-in.-long combustor, which is about 40 in. in diam. in the F-l, would be less than 1/8 in. in diam. in the l O0-1b engine. The converse approach, scaling a 100-1b-thrust engine to the F-1 thrust level, would result in an equally grotesque configuration. A small, l O0-1b-thrust attitude-controll engine typically has a combustor about 1 in. in diam. and about 4 in. or less in length. Increasing the chamber area to the F-1
thrust level would produce a diameter of about 10 ft;
convergence to the throat diameter  in 4 in. of chamber length would be nearly impossible.

As a good place to start, the process of sizing a new thrust chamber  examines the dimensions of previously successful designs in the same size class and plotting such data in a rational manner. As shown above, the throat size of a new engine can be generated with a fair degree of confidence, so it makes sense to plot the data from historical sources in relation to throat diameter.

The total surface area is a design factor for both structural strength and weight as well as for the total amount  of heat rejected to the structure. The suggested design approach tends to keep the proportions of the combustor neither too long and thin nor too short and fat, but does not force it to spherical proportions. Other design fac tors in chamber construction and injector placement tend to favor a more cylindrical chamber. Keeping the combustor somewhat  smaller in diameter and a little longer helps provide turbulence for mixing and reaction; also, the smaller diameters are more con ducive to combustion stability.

Other factors, such as packaging and cost-vs complexity trades, enter  into the final sizing of a rocket engine. A sophisticated injection pattern can provide the required level of performance in a shorter, more compact  combustor  than a coarse, simplified pattern. In some engine configurations, cooling limitations can dictate a shorter combustion chamber, in spite of potential loss of performance. A limited-volume packaging problem can also force less chamber size, with a calculated performance tradeoff. In the other direction, engines using cool ing enthalpy as the energy source for pumping work
(expander or topping cycles) may require greater chamber length to provide the needed heat input to the working fluid.

The basic elements of a cylindrical thrust-cham ber are identified in Fig. 4-11. In design practice, it has been arbitrarily defined that the combustion chamber volume includes the space between the injector face I-I and the nozzle throat plane II-II. The approximate volume of the combustion chamber can be expressed by the following equation:

Vc = At Lcec + ~.~/~- cot 0(e~/' - 1) (4-5)

The total surface area of the combustion-chamber walls, excluding the injector face, can be approx imated by the following expression:

Total area = 2Lc ~x/~-~ecAG + csc 0(ec - a)At (4-6)

As a practical matter, both chamber volume and surface area can be more easily and accurately deter mined by a numerical-integration computer program that can include effects of wall radius and approach angles and also provide information on local gas velocities, etc.

Nozzle Expansion Area Ratio

With all other parameters fixed, particularly chamber pressure, there is only one optimum nozzle expan sion area ratio for a given altitude. Except for systems that start in vacuum, ambient pressure must be considered. This is especially true for boosters that start at or near sea-level, for which ambient pressure will not be constant. It is therefore impor tant to know the trajectory of the vehicle to be pro pelled or, more specifically, its altitude-vs-time characteristics. With this information, the designer is in a position to make a first optimizing selection of a nozzle expansion area ratio for best results through out the entire trajectory. The optimization for ambient pressure then is essentially an averaging process.

A first-stage booster engine presents an extreme case of such compromise in nozzle expansion ratio. A nozzle optimized for the pressure ratio at sea-level ambient pressure will soon be underexpanded and wasteful of potential thrust as the vehicle gains altitude. For this reason, booster-engine expansion ratios are typically based on the expected limit of attached nozzle flow. A classic bell nozzle operates with full exit-plane flow at an expanded pressure significantly below ambient pressure. This is defi nitely not an optimized operating point at this altitude for this nozzle area ratio, since a large por tion of the expansion wall area is at a static pressure below ambient and is contributing negative thrust. As the vehicle gains altitude, however, the thrust coefficient improves and is soon higher than it would be for an expansion ratio sized for the sea-level pres sure ratio; there is usually significant gain in overall delivered specific impulse for the mission.

This overexpansion presents various mechanical and structural problems caused by the loads on sec tions of the wall below ambient pressure. An even worse structural problem can exist at a lower pressure than this design point (such as during pressure rise in start-up), when the nozzle flow can alternately attach and detach from the wall. This condition is typically a cyclic phenomenon and generally couples with a structural resonant distortion mode of the nozzle skirt. For these reasons, the nozzle structure should be as rigid as possible within the weight constraints, and extended operation at these transient pressure ratio points must be avoided. In some cases, tempo rary restraining structures are provided during start transients; they disconnect after start to minimize

system flight-weight. A typical mainstage exit static pressure being used for current booster design is 6
psia, and the expansion ratio is selected on this basis.

The limit on booster expansion ratio because of these factors is the reason that high chamber pres sure is desirable for booster engines. The chamber pressure and resultant expansion-ratio limit have large impact on the maximum specific impulse available.

Other considerations can cause the designer to deviate from the "paper optimum" for the nozzle expansion area ratio. Some of the most common considerations are weight, size, ease of manufacturing, handling, and cooling (heat-transfer) requirements.

Nozzle  Shape

Most rocket nozzles are of the converging-diverging De Laval type. Since the flow velocity of the gases in the converging section of rocket nozzle is relatively low, any smooth and well-rounded convergent nozzle section will have very low energy losses. By contrast, the contour of the diverging nozzle section is very important to performance, because of the very high flow velocities involved. The selection of an optimum nozzle shape for a given expansion area ratio is gen erally influenced by the following design con siderations and goals:

 Uniform, parallel, axial gas flow at the nozzle exit for maximum momentum vector.

 Minimum separa t ion  and turbulence  losses within the nozzle.

 Shortest possible nozzle length for minimum space envelope, weight, wall friction losses, and cooling requirements.

 Ease of manufacturing.

Any abrupt change or discontinuity in the nozzle wall contour should be avoided to prevent  the possibility of shock waves or turbulence losses. Theo retically, the nozzle throat is simply the unique plane of minimum cross-sectional area. In practice, a well rounded throat section is employed. Only the nozzle exit plane has a sharp edge, because a rounded one would permit over-expansion and flow separation.

Conica l  noz z l e .  In early rocket-engine applica tions, the conical nozzle, which proved satisfactory in most respects, was used almost exclusively. A conical nozzle allows ease of manufacture and flexibility in

The configuration of a typical conical nozzle is shown in Fig. 4-12. The nozzle throat section has the contour of a circular arc with a radius, R, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 times the throat radius Rt. Thehalf  angle of the nozzle convergent cone section can range from 20 to 45 deg. The divergent cone half angle 0c varies from approximately 12 to 18 deg. The length of the conical nozzle section can be expressed by the following equation:

R,(x/7-e - 1) + R(sec ct - 1)
Ln = (4-7)

tan a

The conical nozzle with a 15-deg divergent half-angle has become almost a standard because it is a good compromise on the basis of weight, length, and performance.

Since certain performance losses occur in a conical nozzle as a result of the nonaxial component of the exhaust gas velocity, a correction factor,  ,  is applied in the calculation of the exit-gas momentum. This factor (thrust efficiency) is the ratio between the exit-gas momentum of the conical nozzle and that of an ideal nozzle with uniform, parallel, axial gas-flow. The value of ~. can be expressed by the following equation:

X = V2 (1 + cos ct) (4-8)

where 0t = half-angle of the conical nozzle. For an ideal nozzle, k is unity. For a conical nozzle with cz = 15 deg and X. = 0.983, the exit-gas velocity will be 98.3% of the ideal nozzle-exit velocity calculated by Eq. (1-18). The vacuum-thrus t coefficient of a nozzle is directly proportional to the thrust or to the nozzle-exit gas velocity. Therefore, the theoretical vacuum thrust coefficient (neglecting friction and other flow losses) of a conical nozzle with 15-deg half-angle will be 98.3% of the ideal nozzle thrust coefficient calculated by Eq. (1-33a).

Bell  n o z z l e .  To gain higher performance and shorter length, engineers developed the bell-shaped nozzle. It employs a fast-expansion (radial-flow)
section in the initial divergent region, which leads to a uniform, axially directed flow at the nozzle exit. The wall contour is changed gradually enough to prevent oblique shocks.

Figure 4-13 shows the contour of a bell nozzle. A circular arc of selected radius R1 is chosen for the nozzle contour MT upstream of the throat. Contour TNE is the diverging portion of the nozzle. The initial expansion occurs along contour TN; contour NE turns the flow over to a direction nearer to axial. For design convenience, the contour TN is also a circular arc, with a smaller radius R2.

Using transonic-flow analysis, a constant-Mach number line TO can be defined at the throat. Given the flow condition along TO and the solid boundary TN, a kernel flow field TNKO can be generated by the method of characteristics. The kernel of the rocket nozzle contour is defined as that portion of the supersonic flow field determined entirely by throat

The location of the end-point E along contour NE is defined by the given nozzle expansion area ratio and nozzle length (distance between throat and exit plane). Then the right characteristic line NK can be determined by satisfying the following conditions concurrently:

1) A control surface PE can be generated be tween the point E and a selected point P along the line NK.

2) Mass flow across PE equals the mass flow across NP.

3) Maximum thrust by the nozzle is attained.

By selecting points P', P", etc. along line NK, a series of control surfaces P'E', P"E", etc. can be generated to define points E', E", etc. along the contour NE. Calculations for the nozzle contour can be effectively performed by a computer.

An equivalent 15-deg-half-angle conical nozzle is commonly used as a standard to specify bell nozzles. For instance, the length of an 80% bell nozzle
(distance between throat and exit plane) is 80% of that of a 15-deg-half-angle conical nozzle having the same throat area, radius below the throat, and area expansion ratio.

Figure 4-14 shows the thrust efficiency, T, versus fractional nozzle length, Lf, for conical and bell nozzles.

Bell-nozzle lengths beyond approximately 80%
do not significantly contribute to performance, espe cially when weight penalties are considered. How ever, bell nozzle lengths up to 100% can be optimum for applications stressing very high performance.

V. R. Rao. The design configuration of a parabolic approx imation bell nozzle is shown in Fig. 4-15. The nozzle contour immediately upstream of the throat T is a circular arc with a radius of 1.5 Rt. The divergent section nozzle contour is made up of a circular en trance section with a radius of 0.382 Rt from the

Design of a specific nozzle requires the following data: throat diameter Dt, in.; axial length of the nozzle from throat to exit plane, Ln, in.

The wall angles On and 0e are shown in Fig. 4-16

Annular  nozz le s .  For ideal expansion, the thrust generated by a thrust chamber depends only upon the mass-flow conditions (velocity and di rection) at the nozzle exit. In some nozzle designs,

such as annular nozzles, the gas at the throat does not necessarily flow parallel to the axis, but the exit flow is similar to that of a conical or bell nozzle and thus produces the same thrust results.

There are two basic types of annular nozzles: ra dial-inflow (spike nozzle) and radial-outflow [Expan sion-Deflection (E-D), Reverse-Flow (R-F), and Hori zontal-Flow (H-F)]. They are shown in Fig. 4-17, together with conventional conical and bell nozzles.

The nozzle expansion area ratio e for an annular nozzle is defined by Eq. (4-9), as follows:

Projected area of the contoured nozzle wall _ ~ (4-9)

e = Throat area - At where the projected area of the contoured nozzle wall equals nozzle-exit-plane area Ae less the center-body projected area Ap. Another convenient design para meter for annular nozzles is the annular diameter ratio Dp/Dt, where Dt is the throat diameter of an equivalent circular throat and Dp is the centerbody diameter. The parameter Dp/Dt is an index of t h e annular-nozzle-design geometry as compared to a conventional nozzle. The contour-calculating meth ods for annular nozzles are similar to those for bell nozzles.

In a conical or bell nozzle, the gases may expand to pressures well below the ambient (sea level or low altitude operation) before flow separation from the nozzle wall occurs. As explained in Chapter 1, for nozzles with large area ratios this over-expansion reduces thrust at low altitudes. Annular nozzles, be cause of their special characteristics, are not subject to these losses. As shown in Fig. 4-18 for an E-D nozzle (and equally applicable to other annular nozzles), the back pressure Pb at the back face of the centerbody plays an important role in regulating the nozzle flow. The value of Pb is a function of the ambient pressure and generally is lower than am

Downstream of the throat, the expansion of the gases around the centerbody shoulder C will continue unaffected until this base pressure is reached. After the initial gas expansion through the constant-Mach line CD, the downstream flow of gases is controlled by two boundary conditions: 1) The nozzle wall contour DE, which turns the gases to near-axial flow, and 2) the base pressure Pb, which influences the free-stream surface of the inner jet boundary.

Because of the curved wall contour, the gases are deflected, which leads to some compression and local increases in wall pressure. A typical nozzle-wall pressure distribution for low-altitude operation is shown in Fig. 4-18. This compressive turning at the nozzle wall, which is also typical of the spike nozzle, improves nozzle performance at low altitude. Be cause of the selfadjusting nature of the inner jet boundary, there is no flow separation from the nozzle wall, as in the case of a conventional nozzle.

In high-altitude operation, the base pressure Pb becomes so low that the nozzle flow converges behind the centerbody, as shown in Fig. 4-19. Since the flow at the closure point must be axial, a shock wave may occur, depending on the flow conditions. However, the expansion of the gases may continue unaffected up to the end of the nozzle. Nozzle-wall pressure distribution under this condition is also shown in Fig. 4-19.

An improved spike-nozzle concept , the aero dynamic spike nozzle has a truncated annular spike
(radial-inflow type) that utilizes a small amount of secondary flow introduced into the nozzle base re gion. Performance of the aerodynamic spike nozzle reflects various geometric parameters, the amount of secondary flow, the manner in which this secondary flow is introduced, and the relative energy between the primary and secondary streams. To describe the flow field and the interrelated effect of truncating the spike nozzle, the base pressure and the base-pressure increase achieved through the secondary-flow addi tion require a lengthy, detailed discussion; only the basic operation can be presented here.

The primary flow (high-pressure gases), which produces the major portion of the engine thrust, is

Fig. 4-19 E-D nozzle at high altitude operation. exhausted from an annular-type combustion cham ber and expands against the metal surface of the center truncated-spike nozzle (Fig. 4-20). The char acteristics of the primary flow field upstream of the base, shown as region 1 in Fig. 4-20, are determined by the annular throat geometry, the nozzle wall contour, and the ambient pressure. The annular pri mary flow continues to expand beyond the nozzle surface and encloses a subsonic, recirculating flow field in the base region (region 2). The pressure acting on the nozzle base contributes additional thrust to the nozzle.

Introducing a small amount of secondary flow into the base (added to the recirculating flow) further increases the base pressure. As the secondary flow is increased, the overall nozzle efficiency (considering the additional flow) increases because of this in crease in base pressure. There is a limit to this gain in efficiency, and an optimum secondary flow exists for each configuration.

The outer surface of the annular primary flow is a free-jet boundary, influenced by ambient pressure. This influence endows this type of nozzle with altitude compensation. In operation at high-pressure ratios
(i.e., altitude conditions) the outer free-jet boundary of the primary flow expands outward, governed by the Prandtl-Meyer turning angle at the throat. At low pressure ratios (i.e., sea-level operation) the relatively higher ambient pressure compresses the outer free jet boundary of the primary flow field. This com pression increases the static pressure on the nozzle wall and partially offsets the negative effect of the higher ambient pressure on the back side of the nozzle. The base pressure also is increased with the higher ambient, because the compressed primary flow field, which influences the base pressure, has higher static pressure. This combination of flow-field effects imparts the altitude compensation inherent to the aerodynamic spike nozzle.

The Cf curve of the aerodynamic spike follows ideal nozzle performance (altitude compensation), rather than dropping off rapidly like bell design at low Pc/Pa (i. e., sea-level) operating points. All nozzles have a higher Cf at a high Pc/Pa

The development of the annular-nozzle concept may influence the design of rocket vehicles, espe cially in boattail-structure and staging optimization.

The advantages and disadvantages of annular nozzles may be summarized as follows:

Advantages

1) Shortened nozzle length for the same perfor mance, or increased performance (higher expansion area ratios) for a given length.

2) Improved performance at sea level or low altitudes. (Annular nozzles with high ex pansion area ratios can be used for a single stage sea-level to vacuum mission.)

3) The relatively stagnant region in the center of the nozzle can possibly be used for installation of gas generators, turbopumps, tanks, and auxiliary equipment  and for turbine gas discharges.

4) A segmented-combust ion-chamber  design can be used, easing development effort (indi vidual segments can be built and tested during the early phases) and improving combustion stability.

Disadvantages

1) Relatively high cooling requirements, be cause of higher heat fluxes and greater surface areas to be cooled.

2) Heavier structural construction in some applications.

3) Manufacturing difficulties.

Now design an "80% bell" nozzle configuration using the parabolic approximation procedure.  The nozzle contour downstream of the throat will be a circular arc of radius 0.382 Rt, or 4.75 in. By definition, the nozzle length Ln will be 80% of the length of an equivalent  15-deg-half-angle conical nozzle. Sub stitute into Eq. (4-7):

More-accurate calculations of the diver gent nozzle contour c a n  be made with a computer program using the method of characteristics.

Since the calculations for the thrus t -chamber configuration are based on the calculated design Cf value, which has to be verified by subsequent  testing, a slight change  of chamber  pressure  is usually al lowed to compensate  for Cf deviations in order to meet  the required thrust.

4.4 THRUST-CHAMBER COOLING

Cooling Techniques, and Selection

Because of high combustion temperatures (4000 to
>6000F) and high heat-transfer rates from the hot gases to the chamber wall (0.5 to over 100 Btu/in.2-s), thrust-chamber cooling will be a major design con sideration. For short-duration operation (up to a few seconds) uncooled chambers may sometimes be used; the heat will be absorbed by a heavy chamber wall acting as a heat sink, until the wall temperature approaches the failure level; but for most long duration applications a steady-state chamber cooling system must be employed. One or a combination of the following chamber-cooling techniques will typically be used:

1. Regenerative cooling. Regenerative cooling, the most widely applied method, utilizes one or possibly both of the propellants fed through passages in the thrust-chamber wall for cooling, before being injected into the combustion chamber. (See section 4.1 and Fig. 4-1.)

2. Dump cooling. With this principle, a small percentage of the propellant, such as the hy drogen in a LO2/LH2 engine, is fed through passages in the thrust chamber wall for cool ing and is subsequently dumped overboard through openings at the rear end of the nozzle skirt. Because of inherent problems, such as performance losses, this method has only limited application.

3. Film cooling. Here, exposed chamber-wall surfaces are protected from excessive heat by a thin film of coolant or propellant intro duced through orifices around the injector periphery or through manifolded orifices in the chamber wall near the injector and sometimes in several more planes toward the throat. The method has been used, particularly for high heat fluxes, either alone or in combination with regenerative cooling.

4. Transpiration cooling. Transpiration cool ing introduces a coolant (either gaseous or liquid propellant) through porous chamber walls at a rate sufficient to maintain the desired temperature of the combustion-gas side chamber wall. This method is essen tially a special type of film cooling.

5. Ablat ive cooling. In this process, com bustion-gas-side wall material is sacrificed by melting, vaporization, and chemical changes to dissipate heat. As a result, relatively cool gases flow over the wall surface, thus lowering the boundary-layer temperature and assist ing the cooling process. In addition, the ablative material is usually a good thermal insulator, keeping to a minimum the heat transmitted to the outer structure. Ablative cooling has been used in numerous designs, initially mainly for solid-propellant systems, but later, equally successfully, for short-dura tion and/or low-P c liquid systems.

6. Radiation cooling. With this method, heat is radiated away from the surface of the outer thrust-chamber wall. It has been successfully applied to very small, high-temperature material combustion chambers and to low heat-flux regions, such as nozzle extensions.

Selection of the best cooling method for a given thrust chamber depends on many considerations. There are no simple-and-fast rules. However, the main factors that influence the selected design approaches will be the following:

1. Propellants .  The properties of the com bustion products, such as temperature, spe cific heat, specific weight, viscosity, etc., have a direct bearing on the heat-transfer rate and thus affect chamber cooling requirements and methods. The properties and flowrates of the propellants determine whether they are suitable or sufficient for regenerative, transpiration, dump, or film cooling. Con sequently, the propellants involved will be a primary consideration in the design of a chamber cooling system.

2. Chamber pressure. Higher chamber pres sures are linked with higher combustion-gas mass flowrates per unit area of chamber cross section and therefore with higher heat transfer rates. Regenerative- and film-cooling methods are usually combined to meet the stringent requirements of high-chamber pressure applications.

3. Propellant-feed system. The type of propel lant feed used in an engine system deter mines its pressure budget. In a turbopump fed engine, more pressure drop is usually available for chamber cooling. The avail ability of this pressure drop permits the use of regenerative cooling, which requires sufficient pressure to force the coolant through the cooling passages before entering the injector. A pressure-fed engine usually has more stringent pressure limitations and operates at relatively lower chamber pres sures. This suggests the application of film, ablative, or radiation cooling or combin ations of these techniques.

4. Thrus t -chamber  conf igurat ion.  The ge ometric shape of the chamber affects local combustion-gas mass flowrates and wall surface areas to be cooled. This influences the choice of cooling method.

5. Thrust-chamber construction material. The properties of the thrust-chamber materials will profoundly affect the cooling-system design. Strength at elevated temperature and thermal conductivity will determine the suit ability of a given material for regenerative cooling. For film-cooled chambers, higher



THRUST CHAMBERS AND OTHER C O M B U S T I O N  DEVICES 85

allowable material working-temperatures are desired, for lower film-coolant flowrates. The app l ica t ion  of radiat ion cool ing  to a chamber depends largely on the availability of high-temperature (3000"F and up) mate rials. The success of ablative cooling de pends entirely on the availability of suitable materials. where

(Tc)ns = Nozzle s tagna t ion  t empera tu re  (or chamber total temperature), "R

Mx = Local Mach number r = Local recovery factor

R = Effective recovery factor (from 0.90 to
0.98)

In practice, the design of the thrust-chamber cooling system is a major link in the complete engine design. It cannot be treated independently, without consideration of other engine system aspects. For instance, optimization of the chamber pressure of a high-performance engine may be largely limited by the capacity and efficiency of the chamber cooling system. In turn, chamber pressure affects other design parameters, such as the nozzle expan sion ratio, propellant  feed pressure, and weight. Because of the complex interrelations between these factors, the complete analysis of chamber-cooling systems is a specialized field, requiring thorough knowledge of heat transfer, fluid mechanics, thermo dynamics, materials, and structures. The engine system designer should therefore enlist the services of competent specialists in these fields.

Gas-Side Heat  Trans fer

The local recovery factor represents the ratio of the frictional temperature increase to the increase caused by adiabatic compression. It may be determined exper imenta l ly  or est imated from the following simplified correlations based on the Prandtl number:

r = (Pr)0.5 Laminar flow r = (Pr)0.33 Turbulent flow

Determination of the gas-side heat transfer coef ficient hg presents a rather complex problem. Com parisons of analytical results with experimental heat transfer data obtained on rocket thrust chambers have often shown disagreement. The differences are largely attributed to the initial assumptions for ana lytical calculations. The boundary layer that controls the heat-transfer rate to the wall will be greatly affected by the turbulent combustion process and the local gas composition and temperature. Also, each injector configuration produces different combustion

A primary step in the design of a thrust-chamber characteristics (turbulence and localized gas proper cooling system analizes heat transfer from the ties). This results in deviations from calculations combustion gases to the chamber walls (gas-side heat based on the assumption of homogeneous  product transfer), which occurs by forced convection. Before gases. However, it has been established by exper the gases can transfer heat to the wall, the heat iment that the heat-transfer coefficient is predom energy must pass through a layer of stagnant gas inantly influenced by the mass velocity or the mass along the wall, the boundary layer. The basic cor- flowrate per unit area of the gas, subject to the ex relation for this complicated convective heat transfer ponent  0.8. In comparison, all other factors are can be expressed by the following equation: relatively minor. A rough approximation of hg can thus be expressed by the following equation:
q = hg(Taw - Twg) (4-10)

Equations (4-13), (4-14), (4-15), and (4-16) can be used to calculate approximate hg values along the thrust-chamber walls. However, the calculated values should be expected to be lower than the actual ones if the following conditions exist:

1) Substantial fraction of the combustion gases are strong radiators.

2) Substantial dissociation, with subsequent recombination near the wall.

3) Strong, high-frequency, flow instabilities.

2) The combustion gases may deposit solids on the chamber walls, that act as insulators.

3) Boundary-layer cooling may be used.

With certain propellant combinations, the combus tion products  contain small amounts  of solid particles. These solids tend to deposit on the cham ber walls and form a rather effective insulating layer. Quantitative evaluations of the insulation effec tiveness of such layers, which are necessary for correct heat-transfer calculations, have been made experimentally.

In the case of the LO2/RP-1 combinat ion (at chamber pressures below about 1500 psi), carbon solids are deposited on the chamber walls. After a firing, the carbon gives the interior of the thrust chamber the appearance of being freshly painted black. The outer surface of the carbon appears sooty and can easily be removed by light rubbing. Underneath the exterior soot layer may be a harder, graphite-like layer that can also be removed but is more tenacious. This carbon deposit significantly increases the gas-side thermal resistance. The temperature of the carbon deposit at the hot-gas-side interface approaches  the gas temperature as the carbon thickness increases.

Values of the thermal resistance of the carbon deposit at the indicated test conditions, based on experimental results obtained with a LO2/RP-1 thrust chamber, are shown in Fig. 4-29. For calculations of gas-side heat transfer with the solid deposit on the chamber walls, the following equations can be used:

q = hgc(Taw - Twg) (4-17)

First, consider Eq. (4-13). The combustion reactions are assumed to be h o m o g e n e o u s  and complete . From Fig. 4-3 the following values can be derived for the chamber product gases, for LO2/RP-1 at (Pc)ns =

The design (Tc)ns = theoretical (Tc)ns x (c* cor rection factor)2 = 6460R x (0.975) 2 = 6140"R. (See Eq.

Regenerative cooling, which sees increasing appli cation in high-pressure, high-heat-flux thrust cham bers, has several advantages  over other  cooling techniques,  and some disadvantages.  Advantages include no performance loss (thermal energy ab sorbed by the coolant is returned to the injector), essentially no change in wall contour as a function of time, indefinite firing duration, and relatively light weight  construction. Disadvantages include limited throttling with most coolants, reduced reliability with some coolants (e.g., hydrazine), high pressure drops required at high-heat-flux levels, and thrust levels, mixture ratios, or nozzle area ratios possibly limited by maximum allowable coolant-temperature.

Design of a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber involves considerat ion of gas-side heat flux, wall

Fig. 4-30 Heat transfer schemat ic  for regenerat ive  coo l ing . structural requirements, coolant-side heat transfer, and the effects of temperature increases on coolant properties.

Heat transfer in a regeneratively cooled chamber can be described as the heat flow between two moving fluids, through a multilayer partition. Figure
4-30 shows this process schematically. The general steady-state correlation of heat transfer from the combustion gases through the layers, which include the metal chamber walls, to the coolant can be expressed by the following equations:

Taw = Adiabatic wall temp. of the gas, "R T~g = Gas-side wall temperature, "R Tx~: - Coolant-side wall temperature, "R Tco = Coolant bulk temperature, "R

H = Overall heat-transfer coefficient, Btu/in.2- s-'F

The bulk temperature of the coolant increases from the point of entry until it leaves the cooling passages, as a function of the heat absorbed and of the coolant flowrate. Proper balance of these para meters, to maintain the chamber walls at temper atures below those at which failure might occur because of melting or stress, becomes one of the major requirements for the design of regeneratively cooled thrust chambers. For metals commonly used in thrust-chamber walls, such as stainless steel, nickel, NARIoy-Z, and nickel-base superalloys, the limiting hot-gas-side wall temperature ranges from 900 to
1800"F. The resultant differences between com bustion-gas temperature and wall temperature range from 2500 to 6000F.

Assume a station in the thrust chamber with gas temperature Taw and coolant bulk temperature Tco. Referring to Eq. 4-21, it will be seen that the heat flux q, which must be the same through all layers, is a function of the temperatures and of overall heat transfer coefficient H. The value of H is composed of the individual coefficients for the boundary layers and the chamber metal wall (Eq. 4-22). The smaller H is, the smaller q. However, it is one of the major design goals to keep coefficient hgc low, but heat transfer coefficient hc and conductivity t/k high, in relation to hgc. Since the temperature differentials are inversely proportional to the heat-transfer coeffi cients of the heat-flow paths, the temperature drop will then be steepest between hot gas and inner chamber wall. The effect is analogous to voltage drops along resistors in electrical circuits.

The heat absorbed by the propellant used for regenerative cooling raises the temperature of the propellant, and thus the energy level, before it is injected into the combustion chamber. However, the effect on overall engine performance is slight, the gain usually being less than 1%. On the other hand, regenerative cooling, with attendant pressure losses requiring additional turbopump power or higher gas p r e s s u r i z a t i o n  levels ,  i m p o s e s  an overa l l performance penalty.

Gas-side heat transfer was discussed in a pre ceding section of this chapter. It is a function of combustion-gas properties, chamber pressure, and chamber geometry and is transmitted in three modes which, in order of decreasing importance, are forced convection, chemical recombination, and radiation from the gas to the wall.

Coolant-Side Heat Transfer

The coolant-side heat-transfer coefficient hc is in fluenced by many factors. At the high heat fluxes and temperatures encountered in thrust-chamber operation, the propellants used for cooling may become corrosive, may decompose, or may deposit impurities upon the heated surface, thereby reducing cooling effectiveness. It is impossible to calculate the hc values under these conditions without experi mental data.

The characteristics of coolant-side heat transfer depend largely on the coolant pressure and coolant side wall temperature. Figure 4-31 plots heat flux vs.



90 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES wall temperature for a constant coolant pressure, bulk temperature, and flow velocity. Curve A indicates the behavior of heat transfer at coolant pressures below critical. Line segment A1-A2 represents normal forced-convection heat transfer without boiling when the wal!  temperature is below the saturation tem perature of the coolant corresponding to the fluid pressure. As the wall temperature at A2 exceeds the saturation temperature by a certain margin (50 to
100F), bubbles will form within the coolant layer close to the wall. The bubbles grow continuously out into the colder liquid stream until condensation at the vapor-to-liquid surface begins to exceed the rate of vaporization at the base of the vapor bubble, whereupon the bubbles start to collapse. This pro cess, which occurs at high frequencies, is called
"nucleate boiling." It substantially increases the heat transfer coefficient, resulting in little increase in wall temperature for a wide range of heat flux. The heat transfer with nucleate boiling is represented by line A2-A3. At A3, further increase in the heat flux abruptly leads to such a dense bubble population that the bubbles combine into a vapor film with an attendant large decrease in heat-transfer coefficient. The region of heat transfer with film boiling is represented by line A3-A 4. The resulting increase in wall temperature is so high that failure of the wall material often occurs. The heat flux at A 3 is defined as the upper limit of nucleate boiling of the coolant qul, which therefore should be used as the design limit for a regenerative cooling system.

Curve B indicates the heat-transfer behavior of a coolant above critical pressure. Since no boiling can occur, the wall temperature continually increases with increasing heat flux. Line A1-B 2 represents the heat transfer region, when the wall temperature is below the coolant critical temperature. The heat-transfer coefficient remains essentially constant. As the wall temperature reaches the critical temperature B2 and higher, a gradual transition to a stable supercritical vapor-film boundary layer begins; this results in somewhat lower heat-transfer coefficients. Line B2 B 3 represents the heat transfer in this region. Wall failure temperatures are usually reached at lower temperatures when the coolant is above the critical pressure than when it is below it. Where possible, a coolant operating pressure between 0.3 to 0.7 of critical pressure should be used to take advantage of the high heat-transfer coefficients available with nucleate boiling. In most systems, however , particularly those fed from a turbopump, the coolant pressure is supercritical. For the nonboiling sub critical temper-ature regions of both subcritical and supercritical coolant pressures (A1-A2 and A1-B2 in Fig. 4-31), the relationship between wall temperature and heat flux, which depends on the heat transfer coefficient hc, can be predicted with sufficient accuracy for design purposes with the help of the Sieder-Tate equation (Eq. 4-23) for turbulent heat transfer to liquids flowing in channels:

The allowed value of gas heat-transfer rate Q for the total chamber wall should be kept below Qc by a safe margin (Q < Qc). However, there is no such limitation when hydrogen is used as a coolant. Hy drogen has excellent heat-transfer characteristics, with a reasonably high heat-transfer coefficient even in the supercritical pressure and temperature region. Usually liquid hydrogen enters the chamber coolant passage under supercritical pressure and reaches supercritical temperature a short distance from the inlet.

The coolant passage areas at various points along the chamber walls are designed to maintain the proper coolant velocity, dictated by the heat-transfer coefficients determined by the heat-transfer calcu lation. There are several basic design approaches for regenerat ive-c-oled thrust chambers.  Axial-flow



cooling lackets, made up of tubes, are used in the design of some large thrust chambers (3000 lb of thrust and up); coaxial shells separated by helical ribs or wires generally typify smaller-thrust-chamber designs. An increasingly used regenerative cooling method for high-pressure, high-heat-flux engines employs rectangular slots or channels machined cir cumferentially into the chamber wall. Figure 4-1
shows a large, regeneratively cooled, tubular-wall thrust chamber. Figure 4-32 represents a typical coaxial shell design for a smaller thrust chamber. In this design, the coolant passage is defined as the rectangular area between inner and outer shells and two adjacent ribs, which are wrapped  helically around the inner shell or liner. Figure 4-33 shows the combust ion chamber of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, which has 390 coolant slots in the copper alloy (NARIoy-Z) liner; the slots are closed out with a thin layer of electrodeposited copper (as a hydrogen barrier) and then e lec t rodeposi ted  nickel (for

Wall Des ign  Considerat ions

The three most important parameters involved in the design of a regeneratively cooled chamber wall are the wall material thermal conductivity, the maximum allowable operat ing temperature,  and the wall thickness between the hot gas and the coolant. High conductivity is desirable because it reduces the wall temperature drop for a given heat flux. If the coolant undergoes nucleate boiling or is subject to decom positon, however, high wall conductivity may not be advantageous, because of the resulting lower gas-side wall temperatures and higher heat fluxes. Wall thickness is established by structural requirements to accommodate pressure and thermal stresses as well as by fabrication feasibility limits. Further, the wall material can significantly affect coolant pressure drop requirements,  particularly at high chamber pressures.

Tubular-Wall Thrust Chamber  Des ign

In the design of tubular-wall thrust chambers, the number of coolant tubes required is a function of the chamber geometry, the coolant weight flowrate per unit tube area, the maximum allowable tube wall stress, and fabrication considerations. The critical cooling region near the throat, where the heat flux is highest, determines the number of tubes required for a given coolant flowrate. For lower stress, tube cross sections of circular shape are preferred, but other

Fig. 4-33 SSME main  combus t ion  chamber . shapes  are often used to meet  certain flow-area requirements .  The stress analysis of the tubes is based upon  three primary considerations: the hoop stress caused by coolant pressure, the thermal stress caused  by tempera ture  gradients  across the tube section and the wall, and the bending stress caused by distortion induced by the pressure differential be tween  adjacent tubes (if any) or by other effects such as discontinuities. The tube design stress is based  on the combined  stress from these three considerat ions.  In most  designs,  the max imum combined stress occurs at the throat region.

Coaxial-Shell Thrust Chamber Des ign

In a coaxial shell-type thrust chamber,  as shown in Fig. 4-32, the outer shell is subjected only to the hoop stress induced by the coolant pressure. The inner shell, however ,  undergoes  a combinat ion of com pressive stress, caused  by the pressure differential be tween the coolant and combustion gases, and the thermal stress caused  by the tempera ture  gradient across the wall. The maximum stress occurs at the inner-wall surface of the inner shell and can be calculated from this equation:

Sample Calculation 4-4

Determine the cooling passage and the tube design at the throat for the thrust chambers of the A-1 and A-2 Stage engines.

So lu t ion

(a)  A-1 Stage Engine

The fuel RP-1 will be the coolant. Since the cooling requirement is most stringent at the throat, the tube design for this station will serve as the starting point for the entire chamber. For its high strength, Alloy X-750 will be the tube material. Based on experi mental test results that showed  good solid-carbon deposits, design values not exceeding 1460"R may be pe rmi t t ed  for gas-s ide tube -wa l l  t e m p e r a t u r e . Specifically, the throat region will be given a Twg value of 1188R. Using the results of Sample Calcu lation 4-3, the value of the adiabatic wall temperature Taw can be calculated by multiplying (Tc)ns by the estimated stagnation recovery factor of 0.923, or Taw
= 6140 x 0.923 - 5667"R. From the same calculation, the overall gas-side thermal  conduc tance  at the throat region will be hgc = 0.00067 Btu/in.2-s- 'F. Substituting into Eq. (4-10), yields the heat flux at the throat:

q = (5667-1188) x 0.00067 = 3.00 Btu/in.2-s

Material-property data list the following average values for Alloy X-750 at 1000-1200"R: coefficient of thermal expansion, a = 8 x 10-6 in./in.-'F; modulus of elasticity, E = 28 x 106 psi; thermal conductivity, k =
3.19 x 10-4 Btu/in.2-'F/in; Poisson's ratio v, = 0.35.

A circular-tube configuration will be used with an internal diameter  d and a wall thickness of 0.020 in. The assumpt ion for thickness must  be verified by heat-transfer and stress calculations. From Eq. (4-19), the coolant-side wall temperature will be

Twc = Twg- qt 3.00 x 0.02 ...
= 1188 - 3.19 x 10 4 - 1000"R

The design will employ a double-pass;  i.e., the coolant passes down through alternating tubes and up through adjacent tubes. For an "up" tube, assume a coolant bulk temperature  Tco = 600"R at the throat
(the more severe case, since the coolant has passed the throat region before, on the way down).  This tempera ture  is well be low critical and can be expec ted  to remain so for the remainder  of the passage. Total temperature  increase for a typical thrus t -chamber  design is about  100-400"F be tween cooling jacket inlet and outlet. The heat-transfer coefficient required to permit the calculated heat flux for the temperature differential assumed can now be calculated from Eq. (4-20):

q 3.00
hc = Twc - Tco = 1000-600

- 0.0075 Btu/in.2-s-'F

Equat ion (4-23) shows the relat ionship be tween required hc and correct tube diameter, with exper imental data for RP-1 (Cl = 0.0214):

Nu = 0 . 0 2 1 4 R e  a p r  4 ( k )

or, substituting corresponding terms"

k = 0 . 0 2 1 4  o

The following additional relationships exist:

From Sample Calculation 4-2, Dt - 24.9 in. The factor

And substitute Eq. (d) into Eq. (b):

62.4d_2.25 = a-(0.8d + 24.93)
(d + 0.04)

d = 0.85 in.

Substitute (d) into Eq. (b): N = 94.5. Since a two-pass design needs a whole, even tube number,  a design value of N = 94 will be substituted into Eq. (b), yielding d = 0.855 in.

To define a new tube design, repeated calcula tions, with varied assumptions, will be required. An exper ienced designer will require fewer approaches, part icular ly if test results of prior, comparab le designs are available. Even for complicated condi ions, however ,  great  amoun t s  of data can be generated in a relatively short time on a computer. Proceed as follows. From Table 3-2:

And 7 = 1.222 from Sample Calculation 4-2; use Table

Material property data list an Fty of 82,000 for Alloy X-750 at 1000"R, which leads to the following value:

Maximum allowable MA =
8 2 , 0 0 0 -  52,500

15,000

= 1.97 in.-lb/in.

From experience,  it can be assumed that the bending moment  caused by discontinuity in this case will be less than 1.97 in./lb/in. Thus the assumed
0.020-in. thickness for the tube wall is sufficient. Summarizing the tube configuration at the throat: d =
0.855 in., t = 0.020 in., N = 94.

(b)  A-2 Stage Engine

The fuel, hydrogen, will be the coolant , and again Alloy X-750 will be the tube material. To avoid the
"hot shortness" (low-ductility) properties of Alloy X 750 in the range 1200-1400"F, the mean temperature of the tube wall must be kept under 1000"F (1460"R). The adiabatic wall temperature Taw of the gas can be calculated using an assumed stagnation recovery factor of 0.92: Taw - (Tc)ns x 0.92 = 5740 x 0.92 =
5270"R. From Sample Calculation 4-3, the overall gas side conductance at the throat region hgc = 0.00520
Btu/in2-s- 'F. Substituting into Eq. (4-19) yields the heat flux at the throat:

q = (5270-1600) x 0.00520 = 3670 x 0.00520
= 1 9 . 1 0  Btu/in.2-s

A value of 1600"R will be used for the gas-side wall temperature Twg at the throat region. The following data apply to Alloy X-750 at 1600R (1140"F): a = 8.2 x
10-6 in/in.-'F; E = 24 xl06 psi; k = 3.86 x 10-4 Btu/in.2 s-'F/in.; v = 0.35.

A circular-tube configuration will be used with an internal diameter d and a wall thickness of 0.008 in. From Eq. (4-19) coolant-side wall temperature will be

Twc = 1600 - 19.10 x 0.008
3 . 8 6 x  10 -4 = 1 6 0 0 - 3 9 6 = 1 2 0 4   R

A mean value will describe the wall temperature.

1600 + 1204
Twc= = 1 4 0 2   R < 1 4 6 0   R

Assuming a coolant bulk temperature Tco - 135 R at the throat, Eq. (4-20) then yields

19.10 = 0.0179 Btu/in.2/s/ F hc = 1204 - 135

Substituting into Eq. (4-25) gives

From Fig. 4-25, Dt -- 11.2 in. The following relation ships exist:

A 1 1/2-pass design will be used (i.e., the coolant enters the fuel manifold at the e. = 8 nozzle plane, flows to e = 30 and back, and then passes through the throat  and combus t ion  c h a m b e r  zone  before  it enters the injector). From Table 3-3: wt = 54.5 lb/s. Coolant weight  flowrate per  unit area will be:

3.91d-2.25 = (d + 0.016) ; d  = 0.185 in.

Substituting into Eq. (b) gives

N g(0.8 x 0.185 + 11.213)
(0.185 + 0.016) = 178

Maximum tensile stress can now be checked at the inner-wall surface using Eq. (4-27). At the throat, estimated Pco = 1200 psia; pg = Pt = (Pc)ns [2/(T+I) ~'

From experience, it can be assumed that the bending moment  caused by discontinuity will be less than
0.131 in.-lb/in. Thus the selection of 0.008-in. tube thickness is valid. Summarizing the tube configura tion at the throat: d = 0.185 in., t -- 0.008 in., N = 178.

As a general design aid, Fig. 4-36 and 4-37 present construct ion details for a typical regenerat ively cooled,  tube-wall  thrust  chamber.  The chamber shown is very similar to the one presented in Fig. 4-1
and 4-2. Figure 4-36 shows clearly how the tube shape changes along the longitudinal axis.

In a typical manufac tur ing  process,  tubes of uniform circular cross-section are first cut to length and then swaged or tapered. The tubes are filled with wax, and then bent (preshaped) in a special fixture to the thrust-chamber contour. After wax removal, each tube is placed in a die of varying cross-sectional area. Hydraulic pressure applied to the inside of the tube forces it to align with the die and to assume final shape. A tr imming process usually follows. In preparation for assembly into a chamber,  the tubes are arranged on a brazing fixture (core). Proper brazing requires great care to assure even distribution of the gaps between tubes.

Channel-Wall Design

The preferred cooling technique for high-pressure
(2000 psi or greater) thrust chambers, in which heat flux may be very high, flows the coolant through rectangular slots, or channels,  machined  into the chamber liner. The machined channels are closed out and the liner is enclosed in a structural support shell (Fig. 4-38). Examples of such chambers  are those used in the O2/H 2 SSME, in which cryogenic hydrogen is the coolant  (Fig. 4-33) and in the NTO/MMH XLR-132 engine, in which supercritical



THRUST CHAMBERS AND OTHER COMBUSTION DEVICES 97

NTO is the coolant (Fig. 4-39). In both chambers, the inner wall containing the coolant channels is NARloy-Z, a copper-silver-zirconium alloy with sig nificantly greater strength than pure copper but with only slightly lower thermal conductivity. For structural strength the channels are closed out by a thin layer of electrodeposited copper followed by electrodeposited nickel.

Channel-wall cooling has two major advantages for high-heat-flux applications. One is the increased wall mass available, which permits "smoothing" of any localized, extremely-high-heat-flux regions, thereby permitting the wall to survive such occur rences. The second advantage is the ability to use high-conductivity material for wall construction, such as copper, copper alloys, and nickel.

Design of a channel-wall thrust chamber begins with a contour analysis. Key parameters required for this analysis include the combustor injector-to-throat length, combustor length and diameter before start of convergence, convergence angle, and the throat radii, upstream and downstream.

A boundary-layer program is used to estimate the gas-side film coefficient profile along the combustor and nozzle. The local Stanton Number is obtained by using a semi-empirical correlation between the Stanton Number and the energy-boundary-layer thickness and between the skin-friction coefficient and the momentum-boundary-layer thickness. The convective film coefficient is then given by hg = #VCpSt (4-33)

where p = gas density, lb/in.3; V = velocity, in./s; Cp - heat capacity, Btu/lb-F; and St = Stanton Number =
hg/pVCp.

The injector-end heat-transfer coefficient can be estimated by scaling experimental data (for example, from the SSME 40K subscale chamber), using flowrate and property corrections based on the standard Nusselt Number correlation, as follows:

The injector-end heat-transfer coefficient is blended into the axial profile derived from the boundary-layer program (Fig. 4-40), and the coolant channel flow-area and wall-thickness requirements are then determined.

Various computer programs have been written to analyze the temperature distribution in a channel wall configuration. In one such program, "REGEN", a two-dimensional analysis is employed in conjunction with the one-dimensional compressible-flow equa tions. The procedure accounts for variable coolant side wall temperature in calculating coolant-side film coefficients. Figure 4-41 shows a sample printout of the REGEN program.

98 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES of the channel (center of the land and center of the channel). Maximum temperatures (547 and 552"F)
are at the center of the land and center of the channel, respectively.

For regions in which the coolant passages curve, a cooling e n h a n c e m e n t  factor accounts  for secondary-flow eddies that develop in the stream. The straight-path film coefficient is multiplied by this factor to give the local value. The coolant curvature enhancement  factor, which is also applicable to tubes, is shown as a function of turning angle in Fig.
4-42.

An optimized, regeneratively-cooled thruster may combine the coolant-channel and tube-wall concepts. In the SSME, for example, the channel-wall com bustor has demonstrated ability to withstand throat heat-flux levels on the order of 100 Btu/in.2-s. At a nozzle expansion ratio of 5, the chamber is attached to a tubular thin-wall nozzle, which is much more weight efficient than a channel-wall configuration at the lower heat flux.

Dump Cooling

Dump cooling may prove particularly effective in hydrogen-fueled, low-pressure systems (pc<100 psia)
or in nozzle extensions of high-pressure hydrogen systems. A small amount of the total hydrogen flow is diverted from the main fuel-feed line, passed through cooling passages, and ejected. The heat transfer mechanism is similar to that of regenerative cooling. The coolant, however, becomes superheated as it flows toward the nozzle exit, where it is expanded overboard at reasonably high temperatures and velocities, thus contributing some thrust. Application of dump cooling is often limited, however, by various technical difficulties, such as discharge nozzle design at low coolant flowrates.

The type of coolant path for a dump-cooled thrust chamber will be selected to assure maximum overall engine system performance. Two possible paths are shown in Fig. 4-43:

Because the hydrogen coolant gas can be dis charged at relatively high temperatures (1000"R and up), overall engine system performance may not be affected appreciably by the dump-coolant flow.

Film Cooling

1) Axial flow: a one-pass longitudinal passage, using double-wall (Fig. 4-43a) or tube-wall design (Fig. 4-43c). Both are open-ended, with provision for expansion of the dumped superheated hydrogen gas at the nozzle exit.

2) Circumferential flow: a double-wall design with a spiral flow path for the coolant and provision for expans ion  of the dumped

Porous wall materials, or slots and holes provided in thrust-chamber walls, can serve to introduce a coolant, a process commonly referred to as film cooling. Because of interaction between coolant film and combustion gases, as a result of heat and mass transfer, the effective thickness of the coolant film decreases in the direction of flow. In most cases, therefore, additional coolant is injected at one or more downstream chamber stations. Figure 4-44

An important advantage of film cooling is the fact that it reduces heat transfer through the wall. Consequently, thermal stresses become less critical. This is an important consideration, because thermal stresses may establish the feasibility limits of conventional regenerative cooling.

Liquid-Fi lm C o o l i n g

It has been shown experimentally that, simply to reduce heat transfer to the wall, film cooling is more effective with the coolant injected as a liquid than as a gas. Liquid coolant film behaves essentially as an isothermal heat sink as it evaporates and diffuses into the free stream. However, this process results in two phase flow, consisting of an annular liquid coolant film and a combustion-gas core. This effect intro duces coolant losses, which reduce the theoretical cooling potential. Disturbances in the form of capillary waves appear  on the surface of the liquid film adjacent to the combustion gases and accelerate coolant loss. The following theoretically derived equat ion can be used for design calculations of liquid-film-cooled thrust chambers:

In practice the theoretically de termined  film coolant flowrate would be inadequate because of losses. A film-cooling efficiency tic must  be intro duced to correct for this. Liquid-film cooling effi ciency values range from about 30 to 70%, depending on injection geometry and flow conditions. They are determined experimentally in hot firings of a specific design or test model.

Hydrocarbon fuels have been found to be very effective liquid-film coolants, owing to their action as both film and barrier cooling-agents. As mentioned earlier, these fuels deposit carbon on the wall, which serves as an effective insulator. At chamber  pres sures of 2000 psi or higher, however, carbon depo sition is significantly less than at lower pressures.

With the increasing use of hydrogen, gaseous-film cooling has become important because,  even if hydrogen is injected as a liquid for film-cooling purposes, the film between the combustion gases and



100 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES the chamber wall is heated to temperatures above critical within a very short distance, after which the film behaves as a gas. For design calculations of gaseous-film-cooled thrust chambers, the following theoretically derived equation can be used:

s_F Gc = Film-coolant weight flowrate per unit area of cooled chamber wall surface, lb/in.2-s Cpvc = Average specific heat at constant pressure of the gaseous film coolant, Btu/lb-'F Tic = Film-cooling efficiency

Equation (4-36) assumes that a balance exists between heat input and coolant temperature-rise. The heat input is based upon the gas-side heat transfer coefficient hg and the difference between the adiabatic gas temperature at the wall and the coolant film temperature. The heat absorbed is proportional to the heat capacity of the coolant film from initial to final temperature values. Once equilibrium is reached, no heat is transferred to the wall (adiabatic condition) and the chamber-wall surface will have achieved the film-coolant temperature correspond ing to the various axial locations. Accordingly, the wall-surface temperature will range axially from the value of initial coolant temperature to a maximum allowable design wall temperature, at which point the next film-coolant injection station must be provided. It is the specific aim of film-cooled-thrust-chamber design to accomplish cooling with an opt imum number of coolant-injection stations.

Figure 4-45 shows an experimental hydrogen film-cooled thrust chamber. Cooling is provided by four film-coolant injector rings upstream and one downstream of the throat. Axial coolant injection, in the direction of combust ion-gas  flow, greatly improves film-cooling efficiency, whereas normal

To calculate the heat flux for a regenerative cooling system with added film cooling, a corrected value of Taw must be used in Eq. (4-10) or (4-17). This corrected adiabatic wall t empera ture  can be determined experimentally under the specific thrust chamber operational and film-cooling conditions. It has been found that there is practically no difference in the gas-side heat-transfer coefficient with and without film cooling. Thus, the normal gas-side heat transfer coefficient hg can be used in Eq. (4-10), Note that if a hydrocarbon fuel is used as the film coolant, carbon deposi t ion must be taken into account (Eq. 4-17).

Mixture-Ratio Bias

Film cooling achieves its effect by lowering the temperature of the gas in contact with the chamber wall, thus reducing the heat flux into it. Another means of lowering the peripheral gas temperature modifies the propellant mixture ratio in this region, regardless of what  other  cooling technique is employed. Biasing the mixture ratio in the outer region of the injector to produce lower-temperature combustion (usually achieved by making this region more fuel-rich than the core flow) can yield substantial decreases in heat flux. This has been demonstrated, for example, in experimental firings of LOX/RP-1 at high chamber pressure (2000 psi) in a
3.5-in. workhorse combustor. A high-performance injector (95% c* efficiency), with a pattern of intersecting oxidizer and fuel circumferential fans, exhibited high-heat-flux levels in its original config injection results in the escape, without any benefit, of uration, which had a slightly-oxidizer-rich periphery large portions of the coolant into the combustion-gas (compared to the nominal 2.8 mixture ratio).

The effect of this minor modification was dramatic (Fig.
4-46). Heat flux in the cylindrical chamber section was reduced about 70% and heat flux at the throat was reduced about 30%, with no measurable performance degradation. Note, however, that a change of this magnitude is not typical; mixture-ratio bias usually has a much smaller effect on heat flux.

In both cases, the permeable chamber inner-liner is enclosed by an outer shell (similar to Fig. 4-32), forming a jacket from which the coolant emerges. For adequate design, the total coolant-flow requirement  and coolant weight flowrate per unit area of cooled chamber wall must be determined and then imple mented  by a practical method.  Transpirat ion coolant-flow requirements determined from theo retical equations are significantly lower than those for film cooling because of more efficient coolant distribution.

Equation (4-37) predicts coolant flows slightly lower than those required experimentally. It is recom mended that an efficiency factor of approximately

The porous material used for the transpiration cooled chamber walls must be selected and dimen sioned for correct hydraulic resistance to obtain the required coolant flowrate per unit surface area. It must also be able to withstand the stresses caused by the pressure differential be tween coolant and combustion gases, as well as thermal stresses. These requirements  impose certain limitations on the selection of materials and on construction methods. The mechanical design of the coolant distribution system, therefore,  is an important  factor for successful application of transpiration cooling.

Ablative Cooling

Ablatively-cooled thrust chambers offer many ad vantages for booster and upper-stage applications. They can be designed to meet cumulative firing durations from a few seconds to many minutes. Most designs are limited to chamber pressures of 300 psia or less. When assisted by film cooling or by throat inserts made of refractory materials, however, they have proven successful in firings up to a chamber pressure of 1000 psia. In general, ablative chamber construction can be rugged, keep exterior wall tem peratures to a minimum, and have relatively low cost.

Pyrolysis of resins contained in the chamber-wall material does the cooling. The thrust-chamber construction will vary with mission requirements. As shown in Fig. 4-48, the chamber and nozzle employ an ablative liner, a thin layer of insulation, and a high-strength outer shell. The ablative liner is

The quartz/phenolic resin and tungs ten-molybdenum alloy have given the best results. Although pyrolytic graphite has a much lower density than the tungsten alloy and therefore has a substantial weight advantage, it is vulnerable to fracture from thermal shock, making design and installation critical. The throat insert is usually installed with heavy graphite backups for better structural strength. Insert and backups are bonded to the thrust chamber's main ablative liner with epoxy adhesives. These adhesives have performed satis factorily up to 500F. Certain ceramic materials, such as silicon carbide, have also been used successfully as throat inserts in space engines.

The char-rate analysis is based on the formation of a char layer that progresses from the heated surface toward the supporting wall. Formation of a hard carbonaceous surface of increasing thickness is vital during pyrolysis of the resin because this surface resists thermal and mechanical  ablat ion and chemical attack. At the charring interface, which slowly travels away from the hot chamber gases, a large amount of heat energy is absorbed by pyrolysis, i.e., by the melting and vaporization of the bonding material. As gaseous pyrolysis products flow through and out of this char layer, they control the heat flux

to the walls by endothermic decompositions and by migration into the boundary layer.

The ablation processes produce no gross di mensional changes; but mechanical erosion some times occurs in the throat region, caused by the high prevailing shear-stresses. Chamber pressures below
150 psia usually cause less throat erosion.

The adaptation of ablative thrust-chamber tech nology to the special field of space engines has advanced during recent years. Approaches typical of this type of engine are discussed in Chapter 11.

Radiat ion  C o o l i n g

Cooling by radiation heat transfer will usually be practical for thrust-chamber nozzle extensions, where pressure stresses are lowest. Radiation cooling of very small, pyrolytic-graphite combustion chambers and throats has also been demonstrated. Assuming negligible temperature drop through the wall, the steady-state heat transfer for a radiation-cooled wall, as shown schematically in Fig. 4-50, can be expressed by the following equation:

The design approach determines a Twg value that will satisfy Eq. (4-40) within the structural strength of the wall material under operational conditions. Only materials which possess short-time strength in the temperature range of 2600-3500"R have been success fully applied to radiation cooling. Pyrolytic graphite, a molybdenum alloy containing 0.5% titanium, and a
90% tantalum-10% tungsten alloy appear  to have sufficient short-time strength for use at 3500"R. Because of the low emissivity of molybdenum and also for resistance against oxidation, a coating of MoSi2 must be applied to both sides of the metal. Withstanding temperature higher than the working range of bare metals may necessitate the use of insulating coatings of ceramic materials on the gas side wall surface.

Twg = 2660"R

Heat Flux = 7.1 x 10-5 (4900-2660) = 0.159 Btu/in.2-s

Heat-Sink Cooling

Because a heat-sink combustor  does not reach steady-state conditions, transient conduction rela tions must be solved for the temperature distribution in the wall as a function of time. A changing temperature gradient exists across the wall during the firing. The following factors apply to heat-sink cooling:

1) Operating times should be short to minimize the amount of heat absorbed by the wall.

2) Values should be high for wall-material specific heat (to increase heat-absorption capacity) and conductivity (to minimize temperature gradients and thermal stresses within the wall).

3) A liner (ceramic, refractory metal, insulating paint, or an ablative) between the wall and the combustion gases should be considered to reduce heat flux.

Thin ceramic coatings (such as ZrO2 or AI20 3) can provide substantial wall protection at high heat fluxes; at low heat fluxes, however, a thicker coating will be needed to reduce heat flux appreciably to the chamber wall. Three factors limit coating thickness:

1) Excessive coating thickness may result in high temperature and possibly surface melt ing of the coating.

2) Maximum coating temperature (and there fore maximum coating thickness) will also be limited by thermal gradients and stresses that threaten coating integrity.

3) Improper  adherence between coating and wall or differential thermal expansion at the wall-coating interface may cause spalling. This may be alleviated by use of graduated coatings to match the coefficients of thermal expansion.

A refractory metal liner (such as molybdenum)
may be employed to take advantage of contact resistance (a function of liner temperature and of surface roughness and hardness). The liner can be allowed to heat to high temperatures because it is not a structural member.

Film cooling on a heat-sink chamber can reduce heat flux to the wall. If the external wall temperature is sufficiently high (e.g., about 2500"F for a graphite chamber), radiation cooling may begin to have an effect.

Combined Cooling Methods

Various techniques of thrust-chamber cooling can be used in combination to provide efficient overall cooling. Combinations such as the following have been successfully employed: regenerative and film cooling, radiation and film cooling, mixture-ratio biasing and regenerative cooling, ablative and film cooling, and heat-sink and mixture-ratio biasing.

4.5 INJECTOR DESIGN

The injector, as the name implies, injects the propellants into the combustion chamber in the right proportions and the right conditions to yield an efficient, stable combustion process. Placed at the forward, or upper, end of the combustor (Fig. 4-1 and
4-2), the injector also performs the structural task of closing off the top of the combustion chamber against the high pressure and temperature it contains. The injector has been compared to the carburetor of an automobile engine; since it provides the fuel and oxidizer at the proper  rates and in the correct proportions, this may be an appropriate comparison. However, the injector, located directly over the high pressure combustion, performs many other functions related to the combustion and cooling processes and is much more important to the function of the rocket engine than the carburetor is for an automobile engine.

No other component  of a rocket engine has as great an impact upon engine performance as the injector. The measure of delivered performance
(specific impulse) is the number of pounds of thrust provided per pound of propellant consumed per second (see section 1.2). Each percentage-point loss in injector combust ion efficiency (c*, Eq. 1-32)
means a loss of the same magnitude in overall I s propulsive efficiency.

In various and different applications, well-de signed injectors may have a fairly wide spread in combustion efficiency, and it is not uncommon for an injector with c* efficiency as low as 92% to be considered acceptable. Small engines designed for special purposes, such as attitude control, may be optimized for response and light weight at the expense  of combustion efficiency, and may be deemed very satisfactory even if efficiency falls below
90%. Since these systems burn only a small portion of the vehicle's propellant loading, their response in making precise small corrections is more important than their steady-state combustion efficiency. In general, however, recently well-designed injection systems have demonstrated c* efficiencies so close to 100% of theoretical that the ability to measure this parameter is the limiting factor in its determination. Examples are the SSME (99.7%) and the upper-stage XLR-132 engine (99%).

High levels of combustion efficiency derive from uniform distribution of the desired mixture ratio and fine atomization of the liquid propellants. Local mixing within the injection-element spray pattern must take place at virtually a microscopic level to ensure combustion efficiencies approaching 100%.



THRUST CHAMBERS AND OTHER COMBUSTION DEVICES 105

Combustion stability is also a very important re quirement for a satisfactory injector design. High performance can become secondary if the injector is easily triggered into destructive instability. At times, it may seem that the design requirements for stability are counter to those for performance, since many of the injector key parameters for high performance appear also to reduce the stability margin. Stable operation will depend in good part on the injection element type selected and the provision for damping any oscillatory phenomena. Injection flow resistance is an example of an aid in designing for stability; this is one reason for the typical use of 15-20% of chamber pressure as an appropriate level of injector pressure drop.

Injector Design Issues

Injector design, like many engineering tasks, entails many compromises. For any new engine application, there are almost always several different approaches that could produce a satisfactory injector design, and perhaps more than one approach which would provide an outstanding injector design. The proper design starting point considers the particular application, engine size, propellant combination, and design priorities. Of course, the initial approach in vokes complete optimization of all features: light weight, high performance, low cost, reliability, etc.;
but that soon emphasizes priority for the really important design parameters.

Two greatly different real engines will serve to illustrate how priorities are realistically established.

The SSME requirements called for a highly sophisticated, high-performance booster/core engine using liquid-oxygen/liquid-hydrogen propellants. It was to be reusable over multiple missions in manned spacecraft, a use that dictates a higher reliability than any other application. High sophistication and very high performance did not mean inexpensive or particularly light weight. The SSME actually has three injectors: the usual main-engine injector and one injector each for the fuel and oxidizer turbine-drive preburners. Each had to be highly developed for its specific task.

In contrast, at the other end of the spectrum, a
"divert" engine for a small kinetic-energy weapon
("smart bullet"), called for light weight, small size, and extremely rapid response. This engine had a firing life of only a few seconds, but had to reach thrust in a handful of milliseconds. The injector was given an unlike-impinging, 36-element pattern supplied by a manifold with short direct passages from a valve integrated into the injector body. The injector face had a diameter of only 1 inch. The engine thrust-to-weight ratio set a record high, and steady-state performance proved very good, consid ering the rapid response and very small combustion chamber.

Basic injector design will combine prior ex perience and innovation in terms of the identified problems. Type of propellants and injection con dition most strongly influence selection of the injection element.  For liquid oxygen and the fuel a lightweight gas, such as hydrogen, a coaxial element will be the primary candidate. For hypergolic liquids and rapid response in a small chamber, an unlike impinging pattern will be the logical starting point.

For a large booster with LOX/RP-1 propellants, combustion stability becomes a major issue, and the density of liquid-phase injection generally rules out the use of a coaxial pattern. The element of choice in this case would probably be a like-impinging type, such as a like-doublet. The possibly better mixing from an unlike-impinging element would be out weighed by the probability of sensitivity to insta bilities. The number of like-doublet elements used would depend on the engine size and would involve a tradeoff between fabrication costs and stability concerns, on the one hand, favoring fewer elements, and the performance requirements on the other, dictating more numerous elements. The placement of elements will be important in providing good mix ing interaction between elements, uniform mass distribution, and possibly tailoring the mixture-ratio distribution to minimize combustor wall-heating.

Mass distribution, another important design parameter for successful injector/combustor in teraction, can be difficult to achieve in truly uniform fashion across the injector face. The mechanical space requirements  for the perimeter  of the manifolds push the outer row of elements inward, away from the wall. In addition, the use of acoustic cavities around the injector perimeter further forces the outer row away from the wall. The result usually will be a mass-deficient zone around the injector perimeter. The initial gas generated, centered inward, will tend to fill the chamber area, causing an outward "radial wind" that carries a portion of the reacting gases against the wall. With most liquid propellant combinations, the oxidizer vaporizes more rapidly than the fuel. The oxidizer-rich hot gases thus scrub the upper section of the chamber severely, increasing local heating and, in extreme cases, burning the inner surface of the chamber. Good injector design includes a computation of the effective mass distribution and an assessment of design adequacy in this regard.

Mixture-ratio distribution also plays an important part from the standpoint of both performance and chamber compatibility. With combustion chambers made of metals (copper, nickel, steel) that are fuels, it is important to avoid scrubbing of the chamber wall by high-temperature oxidizing streams. Most injec tion patterns are designed to avoid this possibility, and generally to provide an excess of fuel in these areas. Formal film cooling or boundary-layer cooling systems frequently employ fuel streams that directly impinge against the wall at a shallow angle, to spread a protective evaporating layer on the wall surface. Other systems use "barrier zone" elements, either fuel-rich or totally fuel, in the region adjacent to the wall. All these methods involve a performance penalty, since the coolant fuel mainly will be unavailable for effective combustion. It will not be completely lost from the propulsive flow, however, because it will be heated and expanded as part of the working fluid; but this is less effective than burning it in a well-mixed fashion. The performance loss for

Combustion Stability

Combustion stability is covered in section 4.8, but the interaction be tween stability and injector con figuration is an important consideration in injector design. As mentioned,  high performance can become secondary if the system can easily be triggered into a destructive instability, and many of the injector parameters  that provide high per formance appear to reduce the stability margin. All systems which release large amounts of energy have the potential for destructive oscillations, particularly if there is regenerative feedback (gain) between the combust ion phenomena  and the rate of energy release. This is particularly true of the combustion process, because temperature and pressure variations can directly impact the rates of vaporization and reaction. Stable operation can be achieved by either damping or detuning these processes. The injection b)

Typical of these devices are acoustic restrictions, to avoid nonuniform distribution of cavities and baffles. Figure 4-51 shows an example of mass and mixture ratio across the injector face. an injector with baffles. These reduce the effective This, in turn, dictates a large manifold volume, but local size of the combustion area by compartmenting other factors limit the practical size, notably, locating the injector face, thus raising the resonant  the physical space for the intertwined flow passages frequencies to higher, more easily damped, values, of the two propellants and establishing the so-called The baffles operate in a high-heat-load environment, "dribble volume."

With efficient distribution requiring greater flow area and resulting volume, and cutoff requirements pulling the opposi te  way, there must be an engineering compromise. The most effective sizing tool has been a rational guideline for injection flow velocity. A rule of thumb which has served well in numerous design programs gives each manifold run four times the flow area of the total group of injection orifices that are fed by it. Consequently, a linear manifold feeding a row of injection orifices should be tapered, with the area decreasing as each additional orifice is fed. An alternative, which produces virtually the same result, is called the "1%
rule." This rule can be applied to any branch of a flow system and does not require knowledge of the injection orifice area: velocity head (dynamic com ponent of the total pressure) shall not exceed 1% of the local system pressure. For example, the velocity head in a feed line with a working pressure of 3000
psi should not exceed 30 psia. Velocity head in psi is readily computed from Eq. 4-41:

2.238x~ 2
-- (4-41) Hvel --  p A  2

where w = weight flowrate, lb/s; p = density, lb/ft3; and A = flow cross-sectional area, in. 2. That guideline will generally keep manifold velocity-induced distribution variations below 5% in average flow (the "noise level"
for most applications). In engines needing response more than steady-state performance,  it is often acceptable to drop the manifold area to a two-to-one ratio to keep short-pulse efficiency as high as possible, although system pressure loss and injector flow distribution will be compromised to achieve this response.

Figure 4-52 shows the way manifold velocities im pact element flow distribution. The figure shows a typical ring-shaped manifold with orifices distributed around the perimeter and a single manifold feeder. The picture represents the perimeter unwrapped, with the inlet in the center. The injection orifices directly under the inlet see the inlet velocity-head. This increases the flowrate through these elements, commensurate with the increase in effective pressure drop. As the main flow branches into the legs of each side, there is a "vena contracta" effect, and the local velocity is high, resulting in low static pressure in this portion of the manifolding. These orifices typically provide the lowest flow, since this static pressure drop exceeds the pressure loss around the manifold. Other initial orifices are also reduced in average flow by the static-pressure drop caused by manifold velocity. As flow is bled off around the ring, the cross-velocity drops, and average flowrate per element increases slightly until, at the far side of the manifold, most of the velocity head is recovered as the velocity goes to zero; these orifices flow higher than average.

Figure 4-52 assumes orifices at right angles to the flow, without significant irregularities, or burrs. An entrance burr might act either as a scoop, to increase

In that case, the flow is increased by the scoop effect and pressure recovery. The reverse effect is also true; angling the orifices away reduces the flowrate. Most of these effects can be reduced to acceptable levels by reducing the manifold velocity to the guideline values. With good design practice, the impact of manifold flows on injector flow distributions can be relatively minor.

Manifold Types

Figures 4-53, 4-54, and 4-55 show some of the more common manifold configurations used in rocket engine design. The classic liquid/liquid propellant injector for a booster engine typically employs a
"ring groove"-face manifold with a "LOX dome."
Figure 4-53 illustrates the injector body of such an engine (LOX dome covering not shown). In this system, the manifold passages are typically lathe turned as circular grooves in the face of the injector body. The injection orifices are drilled into the ring shaped bands, which are inserted into the open face of these grooves and are attached by brazing, welding, or other means to close out and seal the face. With fuel-cooled chambers, the fuel flow is typically conducted to the outer perimeter of the injector body and ducted into the fuel rings by radial passages (drilled, milled, cast, etc.). The intersection of these radial passages with the rings are called "dog legs." The alternate oxidizer rings from the LOX dome usually feed through axial passages (between the radial fuel passages) that carry the oxidizer down to the oxidizer rings (these axial passages are fre quently referred to as "downcomers").

The central oxidizer tube of each element carries the oxidizer "down" through the fuel manifold. Fuel surrounds this post and enters into the individual element through a fuel sleeve. The injector face is supported against the manifold pressure by these element assemblies. In the J-2
configuration shown, the face plate was a trans pirat ion-cooled,  porous,  stainless steel plate, mechanically attached to the LOX post structure by a mechanical flare joint. More recent engines typically use a mechanically threaded face-nut system.

With smaller injector assemblies, such as the gas generator injector shown in Fig. 4-55, the injector manifolding can be machined directly into a homogeneous injector body. Drilled radial passages directly feed fuel; oxidizer injection orifices are drilled directly into a LOX-dome-equivalent cavity.

As mentioned, the manifold systems for small pulsing engines require very restrictive manifolding to avoid dribble volume. Such manifolding is usually a complex arrangement  of intersecting drilled passages, to provide minimum volume with adequate flow area. This method also provides extremely good pressure integrity, which is valuable, since some

Injection Elements

The configuration of an injector is frequently de scribed as being a pattern of specific injection el ements. The most common types of injection el ements are nonimpinging, unlike-impinging, and like impinging (Fig. 4-57).

Nonimpinging Elements

C o a x i a l  The most common type of non impinging element, the coaxial configuration, char acter izes the SSME injector and other  oxy gen/hydrogen engines. The coaxial, or concentric, injection element usually has a slow-moving central stream of liquid oxidizer surrounded by a high velocity concentric sheet of gaseous fuel. Initially developed at NASA during early experiments with LOX/hydrogen, it has a well-earned reputation as a h igh-per formance ,  stable injection e lement  for gaseous fuel and liquid oxidizer. The liquid oxidizer is deliberately injected at low velocity, with the usual inject ion p r e s s u r e - d r o p  a c c o m p l i s h e d  by an upstream metering orifice in each element,  and diffused to a reduced velocity in the tubular LOX post. On the other hand, the fuel injection pressure is turned into high injection velocity in the annular gap around the LOX post. Mixing, atomization of the liquid, and mass distribution are provided by the

Typical in this application are liquid velocities of less than 100 ft/s and gaseous fuel velocities of over 1000 ft/s. The fuel surrounding the oxidizer tends to shield the combustion process, which enjoys a favorable combustor-wall  heating environment, and also appears to benefit combus tion stability. The coaxial element is less well suited to liquid fuels, or even very dense gaseous fuels, since the velocity relationships required to make it work well are difficult to obtain.

S b o w e r b e a d .  Directly axial, or near-axial, non impinging streams of ei ther liquid or gaseous propellants are generally referred to as "shower heads." This type of element  provides very little effective atomization or mixing, and is seldom used for primary injection. It is most frequently used for fuel-film-cooling streams at the chamber wall.

Fan f o r m e r s .  Liquid-injection geometry that provide sprays in "cones" or "fans" are frequently used in various types of combustions systems. Such injection methods are the primary techniques in air breathing systems with liquid fuels. Generally, these units use internal geometry employing either swirl or impingement to provide a stream which diverges in a predetermined pattern as a finely atomized spray. However, these systems have not been popular with rocket-injector designers, probably because of face cooling problems and high total-mass-flow densities associated with rocket combustors. Limited attempts to use this type of element have not been particularly successful.

Slots  a n d  shee ts .  Narrow, two-dimensional slots have often been suggested to increase the surface area of propellant streams, but they have seldom been successful. Flow from slots usually has proven quite erratic, tending to ligament into large and irregular masses. Sheet flow of liquids generally requires swirl or impingement to provide the desired dispersal.

Unlike-Impinging Elements

Unl i ke  d o u b l e t s .  A straightforward way of mixing two different fluid streams directs one against the other; this in essence describes the basic unlike impinging doublet. The impact produces a fan shaped spray made up of a mixture of the two impinging fluids. With no combustion or other chemical reactions, the combined streams form a largely two-dimensional spray in a plane basically at right angles to the plane which includes the center lines of the impinging streams. From the impinge ment angles of the two streams the spray spreads at a resultant angle ("beta angle," computed from sum of m o m e n t u m  vectors) based  on the combined momentums (Fig. 4-58):

THRUST CHAMBERS AND OTHER COMBUSTION DEVICES 111

turbulence level. Mixing in the spray fan is not perfectly distributed, being adversely affected by any momentum and/or stream-diameter mismatch of the impinging fluids. Stream misimpingement, resulting from the fact that the stream centerlines rarely intersect at the theoretical impingement  point, distorts the shape of the spray fan and produces mixing imperfections. Other effects arise when combus t ion  processes are super imposed  upon impinging-stream hydrodynamics. One such phe nomenon,  that affects the performance of highly reactive, unlike-impinging reactants--"blow apart," or reactive-stream separation, or reactive demixing--oc curs because hypergolic propellants usually have extremely short ignition delay and thus start gen erating gases before completion of the mechanical impact of the two streams. These gases add forces to the hydrodynamic ones and tend to separate the surfaces of the reactants. At high chamber pressures, there is evidence that liquid propel lants  not normally considered hypergolic (such as liquid oxy gen/kerosene) may also exhibit this phenomenon.

This problem may be propellant.

These fans also travel in a direction de may have either two fuel streams impinging on a termined by the resultant of the momentum vectors central oxidizer stream (fuel-oxidizer-fuel) or the of the incoming streams before the impingement reverse (oxidizer-fuel-oxidizer).

However, there is no mixing greater, so the O-F-O system provides a closer match within this fan, since only one reactant is present in of stream sizes and consequently better mixing, each.

Determination of the proper  metering area of the LOX post in a coaxial injector is more complex than in the single-orifice case. Typically, the design velocity for the central LOX stream is low (between
50 and 100 ft/s) and the velocity head falls well below the desired degree of pressure isolation. An up stream orifice can regulate the flow and give the pressure drop required for stability. The head-loss computations give an accurate estimate of the system flow resistance.

Combustion modeling using computer programs to predict atomization and vaporization helps select the most appropriate orifice sizes. Some computer programs provide guidelines for the degree of fixture to clean the injector assembly. Liquid or gaseous backpressure seems to be equally satisfactory for resistance calibration, although gaseous backpres sure gives a truer simulation of hot-fire conditions.

Cold-flow mixing tests. Numerous techniques have been employed to predict injector performance from nonreactive flow data. Liquid/liquid patterns can be evaluated fairly well by using two nonsoluble liquids as propellant simulants and collecting the spray in a grid system. The flow from each position in the grid is collected and the mass ratio at that place determined. These tests are relatively inex pensive and the information is valuable in design. Gas/liquid nonreactive mixing tests are much more difficult to do and are subject to greater unknowns, but they may still provide useful data.

Frequently, injector modifications can be made to the hardware under test to evaluate these effects. Injection orifices can be plugged or enlarged, and orifices can be added for film cooling, for example. Obtaining valid experimental  data in these tests requires appropriate instrumentation. The injector designer must take these requirements into consid eration in providing suitable ports for pressure, temperature, and vibration measurements.

Analytical Models

Many analytical models have been written and used for prediction of in jector /chamber  performance. They are primarily vaporization and spray-path mixing models and depend on many empirically modeled mechanisms and on user skill to provide meaningful predictions. Computer models are also employed to quantify empirically the design features known to impact combustion stability, such as orifice size, chamber  diameter,  and chamber  pressure. These parameters are fit to various expressions that provide a factor that reflects the divergence of these characteristics of a proposed design from previous successful practice. The model outputs provide gen eral guidelines and an indication of pretest pre diction of combustion stability.

Considerable effort is being e x p e n d e d  on computat ional  fluid dynamic (CFD) models, but none has yet been developed to the state of a truly useful injector-design tool. Rational, simple, two dimensional  flow regimes, such as airfoils and expansion nozzles, are fairly well simulated by CFD techniques, but results for rocket-engine combustors have been limited to reasonably accurate predictions of local flow fields and local droplet behavior. The mult idimensional  mechanisms of an impinging stream injector are still not well enough understood to model effectively a major portion of the injec t ion/combustion phenomena,  even if the required computational power were economically available. These mechanisms, combined with the turbulence and other forces acting in the combustion chamber, put CFD techniques out of the realm of practical uti lization for injector design for the present. The potential exists for improved analytical tools in this area, however, and continued effort is justified.

(fuel); the propel lant  densities are 71.38 lb/ft3
(oxidized and 0.72 lb/ft3 (fuel; gaseous hydrogen at

of the initiators into the sol id-propel lant  gas generators.

Design of solid-propellant gas generators re quires the application of basic principles of internal ballistics. Propellant is contained within the case in the form of one or more geometric units, called propellant grains. The rate at which a grain produces gas is a function of the propellant formulation, the amount  of surface area burning, the operating pressure at the burning surface, and the bulk temperature of the propellant. Exposed surfaces of solid propellant burn in a direction normal to the surface at a rate dependen t  on gas-generator chamber pressure and propellant temperature. The correlation can be expressed as follows:

Pc )n R = k l  i"006 (4-45)

where R = linear burning rate of the propellant, in./s;
k l = constant representing the linear burning rate of a given propellant, at a given temperature and at a chamber pressure of 1000 psia; Pc -- chamber pres sure, psia; and n = constant indicating sensitivity o the propellant burning rate to changes in pressure at a given propellant temperature.

The weight flowrate of gas produced by a solid propellant gas generator can be calculated as follows:

wg = AbRp (4-46)

where * g  = weight flowrate produced by the gas generator, lb/s; Ab = burning-rate area, in.2; and p =
propel lant  density, lb/in.3. A constant-flow gas generator requires a propellant design that provides constant burning area as the propellant is consumed.

Solid-propellant gas generators often have sonic outlet orifices to decouple chamber pressure from the downstream pressure, which may be changing during the start sequence. In such a choked-flow gas generator, the gas flowrate, chamber pressure, and orifice throat area are related by Eq. (1-32). The chamber  pressure  is given by the following expression:

1

Pc=k2 A ),n where k2 = constant, characteristic for a given propellant at a given temperature; Ao = gas-generator orifice area, in.2; Ab = burning area, in.2; and n  constant.

Liquid-Monopropellant Gas Generators

Monopropellants such as hydrogen peroxide (H20 2)
and hydrazine (N2H4) have been used as gas generants in many applications. They permit a simple generator system and do not require mixture ratio adjustments. These systems are relatively easy to control and the gases are generated at predictable temperatures. Unless the monopropellant  is also employed as one of the engine's main propellants, however, the generator system introduces a third propellant, often requiring special handling and tank age.

Figure 4-63 shows a schematic of a typical monopropellant gas generator using 90% hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic screen pack (bed) consists of alternate layers of stainless steel mesh and silver plated-brass-wire screens secured by perforated end plates or grids, which are applied with a preload of approximately 800-1000 Ib/in.2 of bed cross-sectional area. The length of the catalytic bed generally ranges from 2 to 3 in. The allowable design throughput, that is, propellant flowrate per unit cross-sectional area of catalytic bed, is about 0.4 lb/in.2-s. The propellant pressure drop across the bed can be approximated by the following:

CiG~ .95
APt, = 0.'---V-- + C2t (4-48)

Liquid-Bipropellant Gas Generators

Bipropellant gas-generator systems are used in most current large engines because they utilize the same propellants and generally provide the most flexible high-performance system. This category also in c ludes  gas -gene ra to r  sys tems referred to as
"preburners," which have a slightly different appli cation in staged-combustion-cycle engines. Bipro pellant gas generators act in the same fashion as the injector/combustor components of the main engine. They differ primarily in the selected mixture ratio to provide the desired gas temperature and chemical properties. Primarily these components provide the motive gases for turbine-driven machinery in the engine  (mainly the propel lant  pumps) .  This application requires a discharge temperature that the turbine blades can accommodate .  General ly, delivered temperatures have been held below 1800F;
current practice is closer to 1140"F. The highest allowable temperature is desirable, since this maxi mizes delivered power for the propellant weight flow diver ted from the pr imary  propuls ive  effort. However, temperatures that are too high have an adverse effect on the life of the turbine components.

Lower gas temperatures are usually produced by fuel-rich operation,  which provides a reducing a tmosphere  for the downst ream structural com ponents. Low temperatures can also be produced by oxidizer-rich operating conditions, but the oxidizing chamber. The resulting system pressures bootstrap to high levels to accomplish this, as in the SSME, in which the combust ion-chamber  pressure of about
3000 psi requires an ups t ream pump-discharge pressure of almost 8000 psi.

Figure 4-64 and Table 4-3 describe a typical liquid-bipropellant gas generator used on existing booster engines. It was designed to produce hot gases from the primary engine propellants (LO2/RP 1) to drive the turbine of a pump-fed system. The control system consists of two normally-closed linked poppet valves which control the flow of propellants to the gas-generator injector. The valve assembly includes an oxidizer strainer, oxidizer poppet,  fuel poppet,  timing orifice, actuating piston, and valve main-body. The valve assembly is actuated by gas pressure, which forces the piston down on the fuel

The valve design, through a combination of manifold volumes and LOX-poppet adjustments, effects a slight oxidizer lead to prevent detonations and a fuel-rich cutoff to avoid possible turbine burning. The propellants flow through the poppets to the injector and into the gas generator combustor and are mixed and reacted within the inner chamber and combustor body. Two pyrotechnic igniters start the propellants. A gas duct with two opposing flanges is located at the end of the combustor body. These flanges connect with the solid-propellant gas generator's turbine spinner and the turbine-inlet duct.

Figure 4-65, a cross section through the SSME powerhead assembly, shows the two preburners used in this system. A separate injector/combustor section drives the fuel turbine, and another drives the LOX-turbopump system. Engine operating points are set and controlled primarily by changing the operating conditions of these two combustor/turbine systems. This section view also shows how the discharge of these turbines is introduced as the fuel for the primary combustion chamber.

The basic design parameters for bipropellant gas generators are virtually the same as for thrust chamber- injector/combustor  designs. The total effective throat area of the turbine-inlet nozzle system can be considered the equivalent of the throat of a thrust chamber. This can be used to calculate the combustion chamber's characteristic length (L*). In general, the effective L* of a gas generator will be about twice that of an equivalent thrust chamber and the effective contraction ratio will usually also be greater. This is based on the lower vaporization rates of liquid propellants at lower temperatures and the sensitivity of the turbine structure to relatively small levels of temperature striations ("streaks").

The primary sizing of gas generators is directed by the size of the turbine, which is dictated by the

Maximum available energy will be extracted from the generated gases when they expand isentropically through a supersonic nozzle to the available exit pressure. This available energy is given by Eq. (6-14),
(6-15), and (6-16).

Because of the relatively low product-gas temperatures, gas-generator chamber designs do not usually employ cooling provisions. Exceptions are systems designed for repeated operation, in which temperature cycling might cause unacceptable levels of cracking. Even such long-life requirements call for careful study of cost trades before incorporation of active cooling systems.

Thrust-Chamber Gas-Tapoff Systems

In these systems, combustion-product gases are bled from the main thrust chamber and ducted to the turbine, where they are used as the working fluid. This arrangement eliminates the need for a separate gas generator and contributes significantly to engine system simplicity and reliability. Figure 4-66 shows a schematic of a tapoff system.

In a separate gas-generator system, gases are produced and "tailor-made" for turbine-power purposes, with the benefit of relatively high liquid supply pressures. In a tapoff system, the bulk of the extremely hot gases of the main chamber would not

120 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES be suitable as turbine-drive fluid because of the limitations of the turbine construction materials. It has been successfully demonstrated, however, that by withdrawing chamber gases from the boundary zones only, and by proper shaping and location of the bleed ports, the desired turbine-inlet temperature
(usually less than 1700"F) can be reliably and repeatably produced for a given thrust chamber and injector design.

The bleed gases thus withdrawn have been found to possess thermodynamic properties comparable to the products of a liquid-bipropellant gas generator utilizing the same propellants. Obviously, a tapoff turbine must be designed to operate at an inlet pressure lower than the thrust-chamber pressure. Furthermore, a tapoff engine system will require a simple starting device, such as a gas spinner. With the aid of a hot-gas-regulating valve placed at the turbine inlet, hydrogen-tapoff engine systems have been successfully throttled to thrust ratios of 10:1 or better.

4.7 IGNITION DEVICES

Release of chemical energy stored in liquid pro pellants can be initiated by a number of methods;
and they have been used for both thrust chambers and gas generators. Selection of an ignition system depends on the nature and phase of the propellants
(bipropel lants  or monopropel lan ts ) ,  need for altitude start, need for restart, system safety, com patibility of the ignition method with overall engine design, and weight and space considerations.

All ignition methods, particularly those for bipropellant  systems, have one overriding re quirement in common: rapid reliable ignition of incoming propellants before accumulation of re active material. Propellants entering the combustion chamber not promptly ignited can cause explosive mixtures to form and detonate.  Assurance of satisfactory ignition depends on proper selection of the ignition method, quality of design, and integrity of the ignition-system hardware.

Igniters

Igniters are defined as devices, or assemblies, that release heat and thereby initiate reaction of the main propellants. Igniters derive power from an outside source or from a limited quantity of internally stored energy. Because of the necessity of having an ignition source available at the time of main propellant introduction, systems can be designed to provide pilot flows of main propellants to be ignited before opening the main valves. Once ignited, main propellants remain ignited, so it is not necessary to maintain an ignition source, although some ignition systems do maintain such a source throughout mainstage operation.

Pyrotechnic igniters. Pyrotechnic igniters are electrically initiated s low-burning pyrotechnic torches. They are designed with solid-propellant technology and typically incorporate one or more solid-propellant charges. Burn duration is in the range of 2 to 10 s, depending on engine re quirements. Pyrotechnic igniters can be mounted to the thrust-chamber injector at the injector face (Fig.
4-2), or through the injector from the manifold side. Flame-spreading designs enhance heat distribution and ensure early ignition of incoming propellants. Injector-mounted igniters with radial flame output
(Fig. 4-67) provide a sheet of flame immediately downstream of, and parallel to, the injector face. These designs were in common use in the 1950s. A more recent igniter design, for an upper  stage LOX/H 2 engine, is axially mounted through the in jector, with a flame tube and a deflector that splits the flow and imparts a radial component to the combustion products expelled from the igniter.

Pyrotechnic igniters for gas-generator propellant ignition have been mounted in gas-generator bosses as screw-in plugs (Fig. 4-68). The igniter propellant, typically an end-burning charge, produces a flow of hot gas and incandescent particles that are expelled into the combustor  parallel to, and slightly downstream of, the GG injector. Figure 4-68 shows a pyrotechnic igniter used for GG ignition for a
1,500,000-1b thrust LOX/RP-1 engine. The same design was used to ignite turbine exhaust gases where they enter the thrust-chamber assembly. It had the following characteristics: no-fire voltage, 250 Vac;
firing voltage, 500 Vac, 60 Hz; pyrotechnic, perchlo r a t e / a luminum/boron /epoxy- rubber ;  flame tem perature, approximately 4000"F; output flow rate, 0.25
gm/s; and operating duration, 8 s.

Pyrotechnic igniters are initiated by electric recent engine systems, for reasons such as these:
squibs that light the igniter propellant. Early py rotechnic igniters fired directly from 28-Vdc power sources, but more recent igniters are designed to fire from 500-Vac power supplies. High-voltage designs provide good protection against inadvertent firing, including accidental application of electric power such as direct hookup to 220-Vac power. A number of electrical firing concepts represent options in designing to required reliability and safety. Exploding-bridgewire or laser initiators provide very safe pyrotechnic devices. Igniters can also be designed to ignite from other "hot" components, such as a solid-propellant gas generator used to start the turbopumps.

(N2H4-H20)  and 80% hydrogen peroxide (H202). Thin tubes supported by a wooden stick were inserted into the thrust chamber from below. Upon an
"ignition" signal, a ground-mounted supply unit, in cluding remotely operated valves, fed the two components to the injection region, where they burned with a spontaneously igniting hot flame. This method may also have been used temporarily on other systems. However, its clumsiness, the frequent clogging of feed lines, -and the need to eject a considerable amount of inert solid material made it undesirable. Also, adaptation to repeated starts would be complex and would require vehicle mounting, thus adding inert flight weight.

An improved technique for using the hypergolic effect for main propellant ignition employs a hypergolic slug. In this design, a small amount of fluid, hypergolic with one of the main propellants, is stored in a cylindrical cartridge that has burst diaphragms at both ends. The cartridge, in turn, is loaded into a housing forming part of a bypass line paralleling a high-pressure main-propellant-feed line
(Fig. 4-69). A fluid chosen to be hypergolic with the oxidizer but neutral to the fuel would be installed in the fuel system, and vice versa. The former is the more common; a fuel-bypass line feeds an injection element in the center of the injector, or a set of elements distributed over the injector face, including at least one element in each compartment in compartmented injector designs. When the pump starts and outlet pressures rise, the oxidizer valve is opened. As pressures rise further, burst diaphragms in the hypergolic-fluid cartridge rupture and the fluid meets with oxidizer in the chamber, igniting sponta neously. The fuel following the slug sustains the igni tion flame. The main fuel valve is then opened and all parameters reach mainstage level. Since the igniter elements carry fuel fed from the main propellant source after ignition, they continue to participate in the combustion, undistinguished from the remainder of the main injector.

Triethylaluminum, a room-temperature storable liquid, hypergolic with liquid oxygen, offers excellent ignition-delay characteristics. However, a major combustion product is aluminum oxide, a tenacious solid that can clog small feed passages and orifices.

Triethylboron, another room-temperature-storable liquid hypergolic with oxygen, produces a softer, less tenacious residue than triethylaluminum. However, triethylboron has demonstrated long ignition delays when injected into very cold oxygen. Mixtures of 10 15% by weight of triethylaluminum in triethylboron provide satis-factory ignition-delay characteristics with liquid oxygen, while producing an acceptable residue.

The quantity of hypergol required for start is based on the feed-system design and the start se quence. Just a fraction of a cubic inch of hypergol will cause ignition at each location. Typically, however, a branched feed system will be employed;
and several cubic inches of fluid will be required to ensure that hypergol precedes fuel in all igniter element feed passages. Hypergol volumes vary from
4 cu. in., used in small vernier engines, to 35 cu. in., used for a multicompartment injector in a 1,500,000 1b-thrust LOX/RP-1 engine.

Organometal l ic-hypergol  slug inject ion-- the standard technique for ignition of main propellants in LOX/RP-1 engines--has been used in the Atlas, Delta, H-l, F-l, and Thor propulsion systems with an outstanding reliability record. The hypergol-slug system has not found application for gas-generator ignition, because it generates solid particles and requires an oxidizer lead; these conditions are not compatible with most turbine-drive designs.

Reactive-oxidizer hypergols, such as gaseous fluorine and chlorine trifluoride, have proven useful for ignition in research and development com bustors, but they have not been used in production systems because of the extreme reactivity and toxicity of the materials and the corrosive potential of the combustion products.

Hypergol igniters embody reactive materials that are not delivered in the engine system. Organo metallic liquids are pyrophoric as well as hypergolic with oxygen. Most, if not all, hypergols are toxic. Field processing of hypergol-filled cartridges requires controlled storage and very careful handling proce dures. When selecting a slug-hypergol ignition system, the designer must consider safety require ments and provide facilities and procedures for producing, testing, packaging, shipping, handling, and installing the igniters.

Spark plugs. Spark plugs and their supporting electronics have been developed to high levels of reliability for liquid-propellant rocket engines. Spark ignition systems are well-suited for applications requiring repeat starts without servicing between starts. The plugs can be used in direct spark applications or to ignite propellants in a precom bustor or torch device. The latter concept has been preferred, to ensure propellant ignition at controlled, low-flowrate conditions, to allow starting the igniter before introduction of main propellants, and to provide a controlled environment for the plug, following ignition, to protect the plug tips. Direct spark systems, in which sparkplugs directly ignite gas generator (GG) or main-injector propellants, are not usable for all applications and require careful design to ensure acceptable ignition without potentially damaging pressure-spikes.



THRUST CHAMBERS AND OTHER COMBUSTION DEVICES 123

Three types of spark-ignition systems and three types of sparkplugs have been used for rocket-engine ignition. High-tension and low-tension capacitive discharge and inductive discharge ignition-exciters have been designed, fabricated, and tested. Sparkplugs have been designed with air, surface, and shunted-surface gaps. The most robust, flexible electronic systems incorporate high-tension, capac itive discharge exciters mated to recessed surface-gap plugs. A properly designed capacitor-discharge ignition system can deliver sparks into a chilled combustor at chamber pressures in excess of 300
psia. Such a system, designed for a 200,000-1b-thrust LOX/H2 engine, was used in a spark-torch igniter for main propellant ignition and in a direct-spark application for gas-generator-propellant ignition. The ignition exciter delivered 320 millijoules per spark, with approximately 100 millijoules per spark at the plug tip (Fig. 4-70). The exciter provided a maxi mum ionization voltage greater than 27 kV and pro duced approximately 50 sparks per second. Oper ated from 28 Vdc, it was active for less than 10 s during the engine-start sequence. Ignition-exciter and plug high-voltage electrical components were

A more recent ignition system, for a 470,000-1b thrust LOX/H2 engine, features an integrated exciter and plug assembly, eliminating the need for a high voltage cable. This igniter assembly (Fig. 4-71) incor porates an inductive exciter delivering approximately
10.5 millijoules per spark at the plug tip. The igniter produces approximately 75 sparks per second. Dual, redundant igniters serve each of three ignition functions, all spark-torch applications. Although the integral-plug exciter offers benefits in size and weight, shielding radio-frequency energy, and providing a controlled environment for high-voltage electronics, the system has only limited spark energy and thus may not be suitable for systems requiring high power sparks and high-pressure-quench resistance.

The designer should provide dual, redundant plugs in all high-reliability spark applications to preclude system failure resulting from failure of a single electrical component in the ignition exciter, cable, or plug.

Spark-torch igniters. Limitations of direct spark systems in providing a widespread ignition source (spark plasma), in withstanding spark quenching GG pressure environments, and in sur viving main combustor operating conditions led to development of spark-torch ignition systems, or augmented-spark-ignition (ASI) systems, in which small amounts of engine propellant are fed into an igniter combustor and ignited by electric sparks. The flame output is ducted to the required area and, in turn, ignites main propellants. Torch igniters may vary in size from about 1/4- to 1-in. diameter.

The igniter is built into the injector or is as sembled onto the injector end of the thrust-chamber assembly, as required, to provide an ignition source at the desired place. Mounting of torch igniters on

Figure 4-72 shows the principle of an augmented spark-igniter design in an igniter featuring a like-on like oxidizer doublet impinging at the combustor axis. Fuel is injected through multiple, tangentially aligned orifices for igniter combustion and for cooling the combustor wall. The swirling fuel also imparts rotation to the exhaust, and the output is a swirling hot-core gas stream. Redundant sparkplugs placed upstream of the fuel-injection orifices, in a propellant-recirculation zone, enable rapid ignition and ensure a survivable environment for the plug tips. The combustion chamber may include a convergent, throatless nozzle or a straight, cylindrical output tube, depending on design constraints for the injector packaging and on the dispersion angle desired for the exhaust stream. High-thermal-con ductivity materials, such as copper alloys, are typically used in fabrication of the igniter injector. The nozzle-tube assembly is manufactured from stainless steel or comparable low-thermal-con ductivity material. The igniter (Fig. 4-72), originally designed to operate with LOX and RP-1, has also seen extensive service with LOX/H2 propellants.

The torch igniter can deliver a very large number of starts, including ignition at high altitude. It can operate over wide ranges of propellant-inlet con ditions, mixture ratios, and flowrates. Following ignition of igniter propellants, the spark system is turned off and the torch continues to operate during the start transients and throughout mainstage. This ensures an ignition source when required, minimizes the igniter's valve-sequence requirements,  and prevents main-chamber propellants and combustion products from backing into the igniter nozzle and igniter-feed system. Igniter propellant flowrates of about 0.1- 0.3% of the main propellant flow have proven sufficient for large LOX/H2 engines.

Spark-torch igniters can also be designed in miniature configurations for small engines. Small, hot-core, spark-torch igniters have been designed and tested that use outlet flame tubes less than 0.5 in. in diam and operate at flowrates of 0.05-0.15 lb/s.

Combustion-wave igniters. Large segmented engines and multicompartmented injectors with numerous individual compartments may require near-simultaneous ignition at many locations. Use of a large number of single-point ignition sources becomes expensive and requires a substantial amount of igniter hardware. A combustion-wave igniter with branched outputs provides multipoint ignition sources from a single precombustor.

This ignition concept (Fig. 4-73) uses a com bustion wave passing through unburned, manifolded, premixed propellants to ignite bipropellant pilot elements at, or near, the injector face. An electric spark initiates combustion in the premix chamber. The resultant flame, or deflagration wave, propagates in the direction of flow. It produces compression and shock, and eventually a detonation wave develops in the unburned mixture that propagates through the manifold to the pilot locations. Com bustion-wave characteristics are dependent on the propellant combination, propellant mixture ratio, premix temperature and pressure, and the manifold's internal geometry. Branched manifolds direct the combustion wave to the required pilot-ignition locations.

The ignition system consists of a precombustor with propellant-feed system, sparkplug electronics, branched distribution manifold, pilot flow-injection elements, and related propellant-control valves. Pilot-flow elements are integrated into the main injector design at the required locations. Propellant flow is established in the igniter precombustor and manifold. At about the time the igniter "primes" with gaseous propellants, pilot flow is established at the main injector pilots. The spark system is initiated and the igniter oxidizer valve is sequenced closed. Combustion is established in the precombustor and

ballistic missile, which employed 80% hydrogen peroxide with either potassium permanganate or sodium permanganate as catalysts.

Because they need relatively elaborate timing, valving, and interlocking devices, liquid catalysts were soon found to be cumbersome and undesirable. Development of solid catalysts was undertaken. They have been used in the Redstone rocket steam-plant and in the AR airplane super-performance rockets, which decompose hydrogen peroxide fed through a solid catalyst bed consisting of impregnated wire screens. Since the specific impulse of decomposed hydrogen peroxide alone is low (below 200 s, depending on concentration and design parameters), RP-1 fuel is injected below the decomposition chamber. Because of the high temperature of the decomposition gases (1400F), the RP-1 ignites and burns spontaneously with the free oxygen of the de composed H202 (Fig. 4-75). In this manner, the solid catalyst indirectly serves as an ignition system. While the specific impulse with an RP-1 afterburner is still moderate (approximately 245 s for the AR), such a system offers versatility, storability, and simplicity, including the capability of throttling to low levels and restartability.

More recently, it has been successfully demon strated that catalytic ignition offers an alternative to augmented spark ignition for hydrogen/oxygen systems. The concept is basically simple, requiring only the feeding of a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen through a properly designed catalyst bed. Catalysts for hydrogen-oxygen mixtures include iridium, palladium, and platinum. Component ig niters have been designed and tested, and catalytic igniters have been used to start large thrust cham bers. However, highly reliable and durable catalytic

Ignition Detection

The potentially catastrophic consequences of ig nition failure have prompted extensive investigations of means to detect reliably the presence or absence of ignition in liquid-propellant rocket engines. Ignition is a discrete event. The only verification required is that safe, damage-free ignition has been achieved. Ideally, the ignition-detection system should be capable of instantaneous, 100%-reliable ignition detection--detection so rapid that, proper ignition not achieved, the engine can be shut down safely. With such a system, the start sequence can proceed only after receipt of an "ignition OK" signal. In practice, however, ignition reliability typically exceeds the reliability of the ignition-detection system. The resultant decrease in reliability caused by combining a high-reliability ignition system with a less-reliable detection system is only acceptable for high-reliability, "ground-level" ignitions, in which an erroneous engine shutdown can be tolerated. Such systems have proven valuable for development and acceptance testing.

Ignition-detection systems are not tied into engine-start logic for upper-stage or space-based applications, where an erroneous engine shutdown would cause loss of mission. When ignition-detection systems cannot be included in operational engine sequencing, they can be used in preflight ground-test safety systems, and the "ignition OK" signal can be monitored during flight to further build a reliability database.

In one form or another, the engine designer must provide means for ignition detection. A survey follows of several which have found operational application.

V i s u a l  d e t e c t i o n .  For the V-2 and the early U. S. Redstone missiles, visual observation by the test conductor was the ignition detector. Man was the interlocking device and would initiate the next sequence step only if, in his judgment, ignition was adequate. This simple procedure was satisfactory because these early systems employed a prestage, during which the main propellants were admitted at low tank-head pressures. The resulting relatively-low flowrates were then increased by starting the turbopump after receipt of a "Prestage OK" signal.

With the increasing size of modern rocket en gines, visual observation became unreliable. The type of installation of these systems in static-firing stands and on launch pads made direct observation difficult. Furthermore, improved igniters, developed to keep the ignition flame concentrated where it should be, i.e., at the injector face, resulted in little or no visible fire emerging at the chamber exit. With the disappearance of the prestage step, the visual problem increased, because the large amount of oxidizer present in full-flow ignitions shrouds the ignition flame. Means had to be found to detect ignition by other methods.

Proper selection of wire gage, material, and distance from the chamber exit and/or center, will give some quantitative judgment. The wire can be ground-mounted or chamber-mounted. It must be isolated and should have spring loading, like fuses, to ensure positive separation.

Wire links have a number of shortcomings. The fused-wire ends may touch other metal parts and thus reconnect the circuit before the relay drops out. Suitable circuitry and mounting must therefore be applied. If a pyrotechnic igniter is used, the wire can be broken by inert particles or even by a dud igniter coming out of the chamber, giving an incorrect
"ignition OK" signal. This has been overcome by providing redundancy, with several wires in parallel, all of which must be broken before the sequence can proceed. In another design, the wire is mounted as a loop in a groove on a wooden or plastic stick. It is thus suppor ted against all reasonably expected mechanical  damage and adequate  insulation is maintained after fusion.

P r e s s u r e - s e n s i n g  dev i ce s .  Because of the need to mount the fusible wires at the exit of the thrust chamber, they are subject to some of the limitations noted for visual and optical methods. It has, therefore, been attempted to sense the pressure rise in the combustion chamber resulting from the burning igniter flame. Since the pressure rise is small
(a few psi at best), however, reliable discrimination is difficult. Further, the transducers must be able to wi ths tand the much h igher  pressures  dur ing subsequent  mainstage. Pressure-sensing devices, however, do have potential for multistart engines.

Res i s tance  w i res .  Another method designed to overcome the shortcomings of fusible-wire links applies resistance wires. Constructed like a glow plug and connected to a bridge circuit, the resistance wire signals by a distinct change in resistance the presence or absence of ignition. The art is to find the spot in the thrust chamber or gas generator that experiences a clear temperature rise as a function of ignition, yet remains cool enough to prevent fusion of the wire. Resistance-wire sensors are ideally suited for repeatable-start engines. substitutes a pressure-actuated valve for the switch with similar effects. This method does not ensure, however, that the cartridge is properly filled with the right amount of the correct fluid.

Spark igniters are monitored to verify that the plugs are sparking, based on electrical-circuit per formance in the ignition exciter. Ignition-monitor circuits are commonly designed to verify spark rate at the exciter and to indicate the amount of energy being delivered by the exciter. Operation of the plug is dependent  on electrode design, electronic-circuit design, and gas composit ion,  temperature,  and pressure at the tip. High chamber pressure will quench the sparks by preventing arcing at the sparkplug tip. With a properly designed monitor circuit, the health of the electronic subsystem can be checked before engine start, and the spark system can be monitored during start to verify spark quench within a predetermined chamber-pressure range.

A technique that has proven useful for ignition detection monitors the chamber pressure-to-flowrate ratio to determine when ignition occurs. Obviously, this technique is of use only in systems in which flowrates and pressures can be accurately measured during start. The method has been successfully incorporated during static testing and has proved generally useful when the necessary parameters are monitored.

The methods  in the above list, which un doubtedly is not complete, are described as indirect because none of them directly and reliably detects ignition, i.e., the release of adequate heat. This is a drawback and cannot entirely be offset by weighing, certifying, and inspecting.

4.8 COMBUSTION INSTABILITY

"Combustion instability" is defined in terms of the nature of pressure fluctuations in the combustion chamber. Chamber-pressure fluctuations are always present during normal, stable operation of a rocket engine system. They are usually quite random, showing f requency  spectra that are essentially continuous in nature, with few, if any, recognizable peaks. In unstable combustion, however, large concentrations of vibratory energy appear at one or more frequencies in the spectrum and can easily be recognized  against  the normal  r andom-no i se background.

Stability can be affected by the configuration of two categories: the "intrinsic acoustic mode," in the engine-feed systems, injector, and thrust which the propellant-injection flow oscillations are chamber as well as by operating conditions. Hence, negligibly small, and the "injection-coupled acoustic it is important to address the issue of combustion mode," in which the propellant- inject ion flow stability, as well as engine performance, during the oscillations play an essential role. That is, intrinsic early stages of engine design, before any required acoustic stability is determined by coupling between modifications become difficult to implement.

On the other hand, chambers with instability. This effectiveness has been demonstrated small length-to-diameter ratios appear  to be more with various propellant combinations in full-scale sensitive to the transverse modes, relative to the thrust chambers  and small-scale models.

Damping devices will be required if the radial blades begin near the center of the injector inherent damping of the chamber can not overcome and extend radially outward. The baffle hub is the the associated gain of the combustion process,.

Injector Design

Injector design is a most critical factor governing the mechanisms associated with instability. In turn, it offers great potential  for controlling instability triggering processes through variation of parameters. Several injector design parameters can be associated with the combust ion rate and, consequently,  the stability characteristics of the combustor .  For example, there is some indication that longitudinal instability may be p romoted  if the times for

132 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES constant-radius portion of the baffle. As shown in Fig. 4-51, the radial blades may extend outward from the baffle hub. A simple rule may be applied to determine the number of baffles needed to inhibit transverse-wave motion. This rule states that (2n +
1) blades are required to inhibit the nth tangential mode. For a radial mode, n hubs are required to inhibit the nth radial mode. No longitudinal-mode stability enhancement  can be gained by use of baffles. Adequate cooling should be provided to keep the baffles from burnout. The height of the baffles is related to the distance of the flame front from the injector face and to the chamber diameter.

Chamber Divergent Wall Gap

It has been found experimentally that, for liquid liquid injectors, a blank annular portion of the in jection area adjacent to the combustion-chamber wall (Fig. 4-79) improves the ability of the com bustion chamber to recover from triggered insta bilities. It was further determined that, in many cases, filling this wall gap with a contoured filler block drastically improved stability. The exact shape of the contour is critical. Experimental evaluations are re quired to determine the most effective design configuration.

Acoustic Cavities and Liners

Another device effective in eliminating organized combust ion noise has been the acoustic cavity. Arrays of Helmholtz resonators (a particular type of acoustic cavity) were first incorporated into air breathing combustors, such as turbojet engines, to eliminate combustion and turbomachinery noise. These arrays, also known as acoustic liners, extend axially from the injector around the radial periphery of the combustor. Because of high heat-transfer rates, single-cavity rings tuned to specific chamber modes have seen wider use. Unlike baffles, acoustic cavities are not necessarily mode-dependent  devices, but can be tuned to specific frequencies. The cavities typically have a radial or axial orientation (Fig. 4 80). The required resonant frequency and the sound speed in the cavity dictate its physical dimensions. The local sound speed in the cavity, however, is diffi cult to predict and usually requires experimental fine tuning. Quite often, cavity tuning includes more than one frequency. If the combustion process has a wide bandwidth, several acoustic modes may be eliminated with a multiple-tuned cavity configuration. One drawback of using acoustic cavities is that they may be too large physically for some combustors. In this case, a combination of acoustic cavities and baffles may be required to obtain stable combustion.

Stability Rating

It is desirable to establish the combustion-stability characteristics of a particular engine system or combustor without an excessive number of tests. In most cases, it is possible to accomplish this by perturbing and observing the response of a normally stable combustor.  In other cases, combust ion stability may prove sensitive to the injector operating conditions, and so the combustor will be operated over a wide range of conditions to determine its spontaneous stability characteristics.

"Dynamic stability rating" is defined in NASA publication SP-194 as a methodology aimed at de termining the response of a combustor to a transient in system operation. Dynamic stability is demon strated when the combustor  returns to stable, nonoscillatory combustion after such a transient. A transient may consist of some artificial variation in the propellant flows or a pulse directly applied to the combustion process.

Feed-System Disturbances

Two methods have been used to produce a transient in one or both propel lant  flows: cont inuous oscillation generators and single-pulse devices:

Continuous-oscillation generators. This cat egory includes piston-type pulsers and sirens that produce continuous, relatively-low-amplitude pres sure perturbations. Generally, this method has been applied to evaluate low-frequency-stability charac teristics of engine systems.

Single-pulse devices. The single-pulse device generates high-amplitude pulses in the feed system, typically by a gas- or explosive-driven single-pulse piston. Like the continuous oscillation technique, the single-pulse device has been applied to evaluate low frequency feed-system-coupled stability charac teristics.

Combust ion-Chamber Disturbances

The principal methods used directly to perturb the combustion process are directed explosive pulses, nondirected explosive pulses (also known as stability rating "bombs"), and directed nonexplosive gas-flows
(Fig. 4-81). The first two approaches have seen the widest application. i_.__

Criteria have been proposed for the range of pulse overpressures required to demonstrate com bustion-stabili ty characteristics. CPIA Publication
247 recommends stability rating with pulses of 10 100% of chamber pressure. Test experience indicates that instabilities can be successfully induced with overpressures  significantly lower than 100% of chamber  pressure.

Directed pulses. The directed-pulse method of inducing instability, as shown in Fig. 4-81a, mounts a solid-propellant- or high-explosive-loaded shock tube to the combustion chamber in such a way that the shock wave enters the chamber with any desired orientation.

Nondirected explosive pulses. A nondirectional explos ive  pulse (Fig. 4-81b) gives the closest simulation of localized, random detonation that can occur during normal operation because of accumu lation of unburned propellants. A high-explosive charge assembled into a composite  ablative case des igned  to withstand the combus t ion-chamber environment through the period of the start transient and into mainstage forms the pulse device. It is mounted  in the desired place and detonated during chamber  operation. It can be designed to be initiated electrically or by heat that is generated by the combustion process. Electrically-initiated devices can precisely control the pulse-sequence time. This is important  for combustors sensitive to pulsing dur ing engine start or at a particular operating condition. Thorough stability rating may involve use of a variety of charge sizes installed at several radial and longitudinal locations within the chamber.

Figure 4-82 shows a bomb-induced instability during a test of a coaxial injector. Note that the disturbance initially decays before growing to full ampli tude.  Unstable liquid-liquid injectors often exhibit full amplitude at and after the bomb pulse.

Directed nonexplosive gas-flows. In this method
(Fig. 4-81c), a fast-acting valve controls a flow of gas from a regulated high-pressure source. This valve is placed as near to the chamber as possible.

Fig. 4-82 Bomb-induced instability data, coaxial injector. tude d is turbances  or exhibits  a t endency  to spontaneous instability. In such cases, a test program can be deve loped  to demonstra te  the statistical
(spontaneous) stability of the engine or combustor. The test matrix should include a large number  of tests at the widest  possible range of operat ing conditions. Additionally, stability aids such as baffles and cavities may be systematically modified or removed to determine the margin of stability of the unmodif ied combustor .  Pulsed engines are typically rated in this fashion, since, the cost per test being low, a large number of tests can be carried out during development.

A method efficient from the standpoint of the number of tests required involves fuel-temperature ramping, until either the combustor develops a high frequency instability or the facility-limited minimum fuel temperature is reached. This stability-rating technique has been applied to coaxial injectors with gaseous fuels. It exhibits a high degree of repeat ability with respect to the temperature at which the combustor goes unstable. Hardware ranging from research combustors to full-scale thrust chambers has been successfully rated by this technique, which may require modifications of the test facility to control the fuel temperature.

A stability-rating program often will be con ducted with hardware of various size and configu ration. Rather than risk loss of full-scale, flight-type combustors or engine systems in the event of an instability, lower-thrust, subscale combustors can be used during initial testing. Typically, the injector element configuration and the number  of elements per unit area are close to the full-scale design. The combustor  may be cylindrical or two-dimensional
(slab-type). The stability characteristics of a low thrust cylindrical combustor can be used to develop stability correlations and anchor stability analyses, as well as to verify combustion performance. The width of a two-dimensional combustor can be adjusted so that it will support transverse instabilities in a range of frequencies characteristic of the full-scale design.

Instrumentation

High-frequency instrumentation characteristics and locations critically affect prompt combustor  shut down in the event of an instability and the attempt to determine the nature of the instability. Generally, the sensitive bandwidth  of the high-frequency trans ducers and the recording system should permit determination of the frequency and amplitude of oscillation over the first few high-frequency modes.

High-frequency pressure transducers provide definitive evidence of the stability of the combustor. Pressure transducers should be installed to permit identification of at least the first few modes  of acoustic instability in the chamber. Consideration should also be given to the fact that these modes may occur in any orientation. In general, transducers should not be installed diametrically opposite one another, because a pressure nodal line of a standing wave instability could orient itself at the transducer,



134 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES so that little or no pressure oscillation would be measured. High-frequency pressure transducers should also be mounted in the combustor manifolds to permit assessment of feed system coupling.

Accelerometers are useful in providing backup to chamber-pressure transducers. In some cases it may not be possible to install high-frequency pressure transducers on the chamber because of chamber cooling requirements. "Rough-combustion cutoff"
control methods frequently depend on oscillation level and duration measurements by accelerometers. Ideally, accelerometers that can sense all three axes of motion should be installed on the combustor to measure the full response of the hardware to pro pellant flow and combustion disturbances.

Although accelerometers are quite useful for measurement of instability, some care is required in interpreting the indicated results. The sensitivity of accelerometer measurements to the structural dy namics of the combustor system and to mounting locations makes it difficult to establish the level of oscillation that corresponds to an instability. In addition, care must be taken in determining whether the observed spectra are the direct result of an in stability or simply of hardware structural resonances. In some extreme situations, accelerometers may not sense the occurrence of an instability. Most often, however, a large-amplitude instability will be obvious on all accelerometer  channels  at a frequency matching that of the pressure oscillations.

In addit ion to h igh-f requency transducers, thermocouples should, if possible, be installed in the backing volumes of acoustic cavities to permit verification of the assumed cavity temperatures used to size the cavities. This information is useful for retuning (resizing) the cavities to improve stability.



Design of Gas-Pressurized Propellant Feed Systems

Chapter 5

Transfei" of the rocket propellants from the tanks to the thrust chamber at the needed flow rates and pressures, requires a suitable feed system. Its selec tion will depend on the vehicle's accelerations, maneuvers, and weight, the thrust level and duration, vibration levels, the envelope available, the type of propellants, reliability, and cost. There is no simple rule for the choice between a gas-pressurized and a turbopump feed system. Typically, systems with small propellant quantities have gas-pressurized propellant tanks because the weight penalty to design the propellant tanks at a high pressure is not signifi cant compared to the complexity of a turbopump feed system. Alternatively, weight considerations require that large systems utilize low-pressure propellant tanks with the propellant pressure in creased downstream by pumps. With advancements in the state of the art of high-strength propellant tank materials and small, reliable turbopumps, the upper limit of gas-pressurized propellant tanks has been expanded and the lower limit of pump-fed systems has been reduced, resulting in considerable overlap of their applicabilities. It should be noted, however, that even pump-fed systems normally require some type of low-level pressurization of the propellant tanks to minimize pump requirements.

Classified according to source of gas, four major types of pressurized feed systems can be distin guished:

 Stored gas
 Propellant evaporation
 Nonpropellant evaporation
 Chemical reactions

The following factors must be considered when selecting a pressurization gas:

 Mission requirements
 Compatibility of pressurant gases with propel lants and tank materials, considering chemical interactions, temperature, and solubility

 Pressurization-system reliability
 Pressurization-system cost
 Pressurization-system weight and size

5.1 DETERMINATION OF PRESSURANT REQUIREMENTS

The physical and chemical processes which take place during the expulsion of a liquid propellant from a tank by a gas or gas mixture are numerous and difficult to analyze. Even the simplest systems require simultaneous, time-dependent modeling of the fluid flow and heat transfer. Applicable exper imental data for a selected system are often limited. Thus, the basis for the analytical approach is

135

frequently narrow and uncertain. As a result, the initial design calculations of the quantity of pressur ant gas required must be considered approximate until verified experimentally. The refinement of the analytical approach to minimize discrepancies be tween theoretical predictions and actual test results is an art requiring experience and thorough under standing of the physical processes. Basic consid erations and necessary procedures for the calculation of pressurant requirements are described below.

Required  Sys tem Data

Before starting calculations of pressurant require ments, the following operating parameters must be known or assumed:

 Operating temperature ranges of the feed-system components and fluids

 Propellant properties, weights, and correspond ing volumes at the extremes of the operating temperature range and loading accuracy

 Tank volumes: nominal values, tolerances, and variations due to temperature and pressure

 Initial ullage. ("Ullage" means portion of a propellant tank not occupied by liquid.)

 Trapped-propel lant  volumes at the end of expulsion

 Operating propellant-tank pressure: nominal value and variations

 Mission duration and engine firing times

To avoid later marginal conditions, calculations should assume worst-case parameter values.

Factors  I n f l u e n c i n g  Pressurant  R e q u i r e m e n t s

Several important factors that will influence the final state of the pressurant gas, and thus the required quantity, may be summarized as follows:

1) Propellant vaporization. Propellants evap orate to various degrees from the gas-liquid interface within the tank. The amount de pends upon the volatility of the propellant, the temperature of the pressurant gas, the turbulence of the gas, the sloshing of the liquid, the tank's internal structural geometry, and the rate of propellant expulsion. To the degree that vaporization takes place, it lowers the temperature of the ullage gas and adds propellant vapor as a component  of the pressurant gas. Also, as the propellant level recedes, a film of liquid may be left on the tank wall, further contributing to propellant evaporation.



136 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

2) Tank wall temperature. If the pressurant gas is hotter than the propellant-tank walls, it will cool and the wall will heat up. Alternatively, aerodynamic heating of the propellant-tank walls may cause heating of the pressurant gas. It may also heat the propellant and thus in crease vaporization effects and raise NPSH requirements in turbopump-feed systems.

3) Vapor condensation. Certain components of the pressurant gas, such as water vapor, may condense.  Even if the bulk of the gas remains above the dew point for the conden sible component ,  local condensat ion may occur at the tank walls or at the propellant surface.

4) Solubility of the pressurizing gas. If the pres surant gas contains components  soluble in the propellant, these components  may dif fuse into it. Solubility usually will be affected by temperature and pressure.

5) Ullage-gas compression. If, before pressuriza tion of the propellant tank, the ullage space is filled with low-pressure gas, pressurization will cause adiabatic compression. This can raise the ullage-space temperature considerably during the initial few seconds of operation.

6) Chemical reaction. If any components of the pressurant gas are chemically reactive with the propellant, the reaction products may become a component of the gas.

7) Pressurant-gas turbulence.  The heat ex change be tween  the pressurant  gas and propellant can be extremely large if the gas is permitted to agitate the liquid-propellant surface. This effect can be prevented through the use of a diffuser that spreads the gas in a gentle flow at the top and sides of the tank.

D e s i g n  Calcu lat ions  o f  Pres surant R e q u i r e m e n t s

If the system operating duration is relatively short, or if the pressurant  t empera tu re  is close to the propellant and hardware temperatures, heat transfer and pressurant/propellant  mass-transfer effects can be neglected. The required pressurant weight in the propellant tanks can then be calculated, as follows:

where- PTVTZ Wg -- RgTg (5-1)

= maximum propellant tank pressure, lb/ft2

= gas constant of the pressurant, ft-lb/lb-'R
= mean temperature of entering pressurant, "R
= compressibility factor

However, in cases where longer system durations and higher pressurant temperatures are involved, the pressurant requirement can best be determined by the following procedure,  keeping in mind the limitations set forth at the beginning of section 5.1.

Consider first a single-start operation (not re quiring coast periods and restarts) and neglect heat transfer from the tank walls. The total heat transferred from the pressurant gas to the vaporized propellant can then be approximated by Eq. (5-2):

Q = HAt(T, - T) (5-2)

where Q H

= temperature of gas at end of expulsion, R
= temperature of the propellant, "R

Both Tu and Te are treated as constant values at the interface between liquid and gas.

This heat, Q, is assumed to have heated and va porized the propellant according to the following equation:

Q = Wv[Cp,(Tv - T~) + hv + Cpv(Tu - Tv)] (5-3)

where W v

Cpl hv

Cpv Xv

-- total weight of vaporized propellant, lb
= specific heat of liquid propellant, Btu/lb-'R
= heat of vaporizat ion of the propellant,

Btu/lb
= specific heat of propellant vapor, Btu/lb-'R
= vaporization temperature of propellant, R

The value of Wv can now be obtained from Eq. (5-2)
and (5-3) with an assumed value for Tu. The partial volume occupied by the vaporized propellant will be as follows:

Vv WvZRpTu
= PT (5-4)

where Vv = total volume occupied by the vaporized propellant, ft3; Z = compressibility factor evaluated at the total pressure PT and the temperature Tu of the gaseous mixture at the end of expulsion; Rp = gas constant of the propellant vapor, ft-lb/lb-'R.

The propellant-tank volume remaining at the end of expulsion can be assumed to be occupied by the pressurant gas:

vg = VT- Vv (5-5)

where Vg = volume of pressurant gas at the end of ex pulsion, ft3. The weight of pressurant will be calcu


GAS-PRESSURIZED PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 137

lated as follows:

PTVgZ Wg= RgTu- (5-6)

To maintain the heat balance, the value for Q should satisfy the following equation.

Q = WgCpg(Tg-  Tu) (5-7)

where Cpg = specific heat at constant pressure of pressurant gas, Btu/lb-'R. From Eq. (5-7) the required value of Tg for the assumed Tu can thus be cal culated. If, however, Tg is a predetermined fixed value, then the values of Wg, Wv, and T u must satisfy the following as well as other correlated equations:

WgCpg(Tg-  Tu)

= Wv[Cp,(Tv - Te) + hv + Cpv(Tu - Tv)] (5-8)

Thus far, heat transfer from the tank walls has been neglected. However, if there is a considerable temperature differential between pressurant gas, propellants, and tank walls, the total heat transferred between them during the mission must be taken into considerat ion to determine the quant i ty  of vaporized propel lant  at the end of expulsion. Equation (5-3) can be rewritten as  Q  Qw, = Wv[Cpl(Tv - Te) + hv + Cpv(Tu - T,,)] (5-9)

where Qw I = total heat transferred between tank walls and liquid and gaseous propellant during the mission, Btu. The positive
(+) or negative (-) sign indicates whether Qw 1 is from, or to, the tank walls. Furthermore, Eq. (5-7) becomes this:

Q = W g C p g ( T g -  Tu)  Qw2 (5-10)

where Qw2 = total heat transferred between pressur ant gas and tank walls during a mission, Btu. Again the positive or negative sign indicates whether heat is from, or to, the tank walls.

Combining Eq. (5-9) and (5-10), the heat balance considering heat transfer from the tank walls can be written as follows:

[WgCpg(Tg-" Tu)]  Qw2 = Wv[Cp,(Tv - T,)

+ hv + Cpv(T, -- Tv)]-  ( 4- Qw,) (5-~ ~)

If the vehicle mission includes several powered-flight and coast periods, the calculation of the heat transfer across the gas-liquid interface should take the total mission time into consideration. Then Eq. (5-2) can be rewritten as follows:

Q = HAtm(Tm -- Te) (5-12)

where tm = total mission time including powered flight and coast periods, s, and Tm = mean temperature of pressurant gases during the entire mission, R. This is a function of many factors such as length of coast periods and heat transfer between gas and tank wall.

Other effects such as vapor  condensat ion, solubility of the pressurant gas in the propellant, and chemical reactions of the pressurant gas with the propellant can be included; but, because of the complexity of the processes, it is usually necessary to make gross assumptions or use experimental data. Vapor condensa t ion  depends  on gas-circulation patterns and contact with cooler surfaces. Solubility depends upon how vibration affects diffusion into the propellant. Chemical reactions depend on the fluids involved.

It is important to be conservative in determining the required pressurant. Inadequate pressurant will prematurely end the mission. If a cold gas is used, there may be significant cost and schedule impact to redesign the pressurant-tank volume or wall thickness for a higher pressure. The penalty for this conser vatism is weight associated with a larger or thicker walled tank.

In some cases, the uncertainties in pressurant sys tem design can be reduced by providing adjustability of the pressurant temperature at the propellant-tank inlet. In this approach, the temperature of the pres surant gas at the end of expulsion is assumed or targeted from the beginning. Based on this and other given or assumed data, the values of required pressurant quantity and inlet temperature can be calculated by Eq. (5-1) through (5-11). If the required pressurant quantity based on test data deviates from the calculations, an adjustment of the pressurant temperature at the propellant-tank inlet can often be made to correct for this difference, such as through an adjustment of the pressurant supply from a heat exchanger or from a gas generator. The following sample calculation demonstrates this design ap proach:

5.2 STORED-GAS SYSTEMS

Stored-gas pressurization systems are widely used. The gas is usually stored in a tank at an initial pressure ranging up to 10,000 psi and supplied to the propellant tanks at a specified pressure controlled by a regulator. These systems have achieved a high level of reliability. In early systems, nitrogen or even air (German V-2) was frequently used, mainly for logistics reasons. As it became more readily available, helium found increased usage because of its substantially lower molecular weight and thus reduced total pressurant weight. For hydrogen-fueled engines, reliable hydrogen systems have been successfully developed. In general, the most impor tant design requirements for a stored-gas system are low molecular weight of the gas, high gas density at storage conditions, minimum residual-gas weight, and high al lowable s tress- to-densi ty ratio of the pressurant-tank material. The following discussions will be based on helium systems, since they are now the most widely used.

Commonly Used Configurations

Hel ium s y s t e m  w i t h o u t  heat ing .  This pressurization system is shown schematically in Fig. 5-1. It consists of a high-pressure storage tank, a start and shutoff valve, and a pressure regulator. Regulated helium is ducted directly to the propellant tanks. This has the advantage of great simplicity. However, the weight of the system is relatively high because of the low temperature and specific volume of the gas.

Helium sys tem using thrus t -chamber  heat e x c h a n g e r s .  This system, which is used in the design for the A-3 and A-4 Stage propulsion systems, consists of a high-pressure helium storage tank, a start and shutoff valve, manifolded thrust-chamber heat exchangers, and a pressure regulator. Figure 5-2
shows a typical schematic. The heat exchangers are part of the thrust-chamber divergent nozzle section and absorb heat from the combustion process. From overall performance and weight considerations, it is considered preferable to locate the heat exchanger in the high-pressure portion of the system. Volume increase of the gas due to heating reduces the mass required for tank pressurization. However, a con siderable quantity of cold, high-density helium still remains in the storage tank at the end of expulsion.

Helium cascade  sys tem.  The cascade system shown schematically in Fig. 5-3 is an all-helium pressurization system designed to minimize the weight penalty resulting from cooling of the helium during expansion. System components  include helium-storage tanks of equal pressure but of different sizes (two of which are divided internally by a flexible diaphragm), three thrust-chamber heat

140 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES exchangers, a start-and-shutoff valve, and a pressure regulator. During operation of the system, helium flows from the first and smallest tank, through a heat exchanger, and displaces the helium in the interme diate tank. The helium in the intermediate tank in turn flows through a second heat exchanger and displaces the helium in the last and largest tank. The latter flows through a third heat exchanger and pressurizes the propellant tanks. At the end of the operation, only the small storage tank contains low temperature, high-density helium, while the two larger storage tanks contain relatively warm, low-density helium. This contrasts with the preceding systems in which one large tank remains partially filled with low temperature, high-density helium. The disadvantages of cascade systems are high weight and complexity.

Helium sys tem with heat ing inside s to rage tank .  Shown schematically in Fig. 5-4, this system consists of a high-pressure helium storage tank containing a heat exchanger or other heat-generating device mounted internally, a start-and-shutoff valve, and a pressure regulator. This system provides higher-temperature helium to the propellant tanks, simultaneously assuring relatively warm residual gas in the storage tank. Disadvantages are the need for larger and more complex high-pressure storage tanks and the possibility of control problems during operation.

For the pressurization of liquid-hydrogen pro pellant tanks, stored hydrogen gas can be used in place of helium for the systems described above.

Calculations for Stored-Gas Requirements

The design calculations discussed in section 5.1
applied only to the quantity of gas required to pressurize the propellant tanks. However, the gross weight of the stored gas required for a given system depends also on the system design, on the expansion process during operation, and on the environmental temperature range within which the system must function. Based on condit ions at the end of expulsion, the total stored-gas requirement can be expressed by the following correlation:

If a heating source is provided inside the tank, as shown in Fig. 5-4, the expansion process of the gas within would be polytropic. For a system without heating inside the storage tank, the expansion process of the gas can be assumed to be isentropic;
i.e., no heat is transferred between gas and tank walls. From Eq. (1-13) the following correlation can be derived to calculate the final gas temperature in the storage tank:

A parameter  to define these additions is the
"pressurant-use factor," the ratio of stored-gas re quirement or initial gas weight in the storage tank to the net weight of pressurant utilized:

Pressurant _ Stored-gas requirement m use factor Propellant tank requirement

(5o14)

The lowest pressure level in a storage tank required to safely operate the pressurization system will be deter mined by the individual system pressure-drops. Figure 5-5 shows estimated pressure drops for the stored-helium pressurization system with thrust chamber heating that was selected for the A-4 Stage where- T 1 = initial helium temperature in the tank, "R T2 - final helium temperature in the tank, "R P1 = initial helium pressure in the tank, psia P2 - final helium pressure in the tank, psia n - exponent for the polytropic expansion process The exponent  n is estimated during analytical treatment and verified experimentally. For isen tropic expansion of helium, n -- 1.67.

For most analyses, it has been found adequate to assume an adiabatic flow process through regulator and lines. It is a characteristic of this process that the total (or "stagnation") temperature remains constant. Since the gas essentially comes to rest in



GAS-PRESSURIZED PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 141

the propellant tank and no further compression takes place following initial propellant-tank pressurization, it is assumed that the propellant-tank temperature equals the heat-exchanger outlet temperature.

If an operating temperature range is specified for a system, the lower temperature limit must be used to calculate the weight of pressurant required, while the upper limit determines the volume of the gas storage tank for a given storage pressure. Thus, for a stated propellant tank net pressurant gas requirement, a wider environmental temperature range results in a heavier pressurization system, regardless of the expansion process of the gas.

Sample Calculation 5-2

The following data characterize the stored-helium pressurization system of the A-4 Stage oxidizer tank:
temperature range in the storage tank at system start,
500-560"R; storage-tank pressure at system start, 4500

The following calculations establish the requirements for the oxidizer tank, which in the A-4 Stage has the higher minimum-storage-pressure requirement. To this required pressurant mass and volumes for fuel tank pressurization must be added purges and valve actuations.

It is further assumed that the temperature of the residual pressurant in the heat exchangers have propellant-tank inlet conditions, or 995R, and that the pressure is that of the residual helium in the pressurant-storage tank, or 400 psia. That produces the following value for these residuals:

Design of  Stored-Gas System Components

Since system components can be expected to require relatively extensive development  effort to achieve satisfactory performance and reliability, they require very careful design thought. This is especially true for large, high-pressure, lightweight, pressurant stor age tanks, pressure regulators, and thrust-chamber nozzle heat exchangers.

Tanks

Because of the combined  requirement  of high pressure and lightweight, pressurant tanks are gen erally spherical in shape and made of high-strength to-weight materials. Stainless steel, titanium, and thin metallic liners filament-wound with matrix materials of glass, Kevlar, or graphite-and-resin systems have been successfully employed as construction materials for tanks. Design details for pressurant tanks will be further discussed in Chapter 8.

For weight estimates in preliminary design of large tanks, it is assumed that they are made of two hemispherical shells and that the thickness of the weld lands can be accounted for by assuming a 3-in. wide band of one-half the wall thickness placed over the weld seam. Hence, the total weight of the tank can be estimated as follows:

Wv = 7rd2pm(pd/4s) + 3zcl,om(0.5pd/4s) (5-16)

where Wv = weight of the tank, lb; d - inside diame ter of the tank, in.; p = maximum storage pressure, psia; s = allowable working stress of the material, psi;

and P m = density of the material, lb/in.3. It is of prime importance in the design of stored gas systems that the tank be capable of containing the gas at high pressure for long periods without leakage. Frequent checking of the storage pressure or recharging is undesirable  in most applications. Experimental data indicate that gases of low molec ular weight, such as helium and hydrogen, will not leak through homogeneous  metals such as good quality, hot-rolled stock or forgings. However, they can leak through porous metals such as may exist in castings and in we lded  joints. Good weld ing workmanship and effective leakage inspection are very important in the fabrication of sound tanks.



Pressure  Regulators Heat l Exchanger- r le Most pressurization systems need a high-accuracy regulator. Regulation becomes particularly difficult if the system requires high-temperature gas, high flow rate, large variation in inlet pressure,  or large variation in downstream volume. Design detail of pressure regulators will be discussed in Chapter 7. For some applications, .a control system combining a pressure switch, a solenoid valve, and an orifice may be preferred.

Thrust -Chamber  Heat E x c h a n g e r s

For helium systems using thrust-chamber heat ex changers, as shown in Fig. 5-2, the heat exchanger should be designed as an integral part of the thrust chamber expansion nozzle. As a rule, the heat exchanger will be made of coiled tubing formed to fit the nozzle contour (see Fig. 5-6).

The combustion-gas-side heat-transfer coefficient can be determined by methods described in Chapter
4. The heat conducted through the wall of the heat exchanger is assumed to be totally absorbed by the helium pressurant,  raising its temperature.  The determination of the helium-side heat-transfer coef ficient and the design of the heat exchanger tubing follow the analyses for the regeneratively-cooled tubular-wall thrust chamber. The number of tube turns for the heat exchanger is a function of the helium temperature rise required and of the heat exchanger  location at the nozzle. The various operat ing parameters of a thrust -chamber  heat exchanger  can be correlated by the following equation:

Thrust-chamber heat  exchanger . at any given time depends  on the tank exit temperature. The choice of heat-exchanger tube material must be made with consideration of its brazing compatibility with the thrust-chamber nozzle wall. The heat exchanger must be firmly attached to the nozzle wall, because its efficiency depends on intimate contact. Selection of tube thickness must be based on pressure and thermal-stress conditions.

Sample Calculation 5-3

The following data characterize the design of the pressurant heat exchangers for the A-4 Stage engine thrust-chamber nozzle extension, when located at an area ratio = 10 and used in parallel: helium flow rate through each heat exchanger W h = 0.024 lb/s (con siders requirements for both tanks and for other uses); helium specific heat ratio 7 = 1.67; helium spe cific heat at constant pressure Cp = 1.25; mean tem perature of helium at heat exchanger inlet Ti = 346"R;
mean temperature of helium at heat-exchanger outlet To = 1030R [from Sample Calculation (5-1), Case

P r o b l e m

Calculate the following:

(a) Heat-exchanger-tube dimensions, assuming tube to be made of 13V-11Cr-3A1 titanium alloy with the following physical characteristics, at a recommended maximum working temperature range of 1400-15500R:

= 0.33.

(b) Number of turns of the heat-exchanger tubing.

Solution 5-3

(a) The wall temperature at given sections of the heat exchanger will vary directly with the bulk temperature of the helium in these sections. Maxi mum wall temperature occurs at the heat-exchanger outlets. A mean combustion-gas-side wall temperature T,, at the outlets of 1400"R is allowed. Equation (4-10)
giv& the heat flux at that section:

A stipulated tube wall-thickness t of 0.05 in. will be checked below for compatibility with pressure and thermal stresses. From Eq. (4-19) the mean helium side wall temperature will be t 'I 0.05 X 0.2 T,, = T  ---= 1400  wg k 2.04 x

Using Eq. (4-20), the helium-side heat transfer coeffi cient will be calculated as h,, = hc = q - 0.2
(Twc - Tco) - (1350 - 1030)

Equation (4-15) permits determination of the Prandtl number of the flowing helium:

The viscosity of the helium according to Eq. (4-16)
is Inside tubing diameter d = 0.44 in. Check for combined pressure and thermal stresses at the heat-exchanger outlet (neglecting bending stress) using Eq. (4-27) and assuming bend ing stress caused by discontinuities to be negligible, as follows:

P C  - P )  Eaqt S, = +

t 2(1 - v)k

= 19,800 + 2200 = 22,000 psia (bs-48)

The combined pressure and thermal stresses at the heat exchanger inlet are now checked. It can be assumed that the difference between the combustion gas-side wall temperature and the helium bulk temperature remains approximately constant throughout the heat exchanger. Then:

Twg at the inlet = 1400-(1030-346) = 716"R (mean temperature)
Heat flux q at the inlet = 5.7 x 10-5 (4900-716) =

0.239 Btuhn.2-s

Combined stress St at the inlet will then be
= 19,800 + 2630 = 22,430 psia (bs-49)

Therefore, it is safe to use the selected tube size of
0.440-in. inside diameter and 0.050-in. wall thickness, with sufficient margin for the fact that the heat-ex changer helium inlet temperature will be higher than the maximum at the beginning of the process.

(b) Equation (5-17) gives the required effective area for each heat-exchanger element:

5.3 PROPELLANT-EVAPORATION SYSTEMS

This concept is practical only for thermally stable, low-normal-boiling-point propellants, such as cryo genics and near-cryogenics, for which it is widely used, particularly for cryogenics of low molecular weight, such as hydrogen.

Pump-Fed Propellant Feed Systems

Propellant-evaporation systems for pump-fed engines usually employ propellants tapped off downstream of the pump and vaporized in a heat exchanger, after which they are used to pressurize the main propellant tank from which they were withdrawn. Figure 5-7
shows a typical heat-exchanger design used in an LOX/RP-1 pump-fed engine system. The turbine exhaust gases are used as the heat source. Sometimes the vaporized propellant is bled directly from the manifold downs t r eam of the chamber -cool ing passage if it is the coolant in a regeneratively cooled thrust chamber. As shown schematically in Fig. 3-3
and 5-8, the pressurant for the A-2 Stage main oxidizer tank receives oxygen tapped off downstream of the oxidizer pump and vaporized in a heat ex changer located at the turbine-exhaust duct of the oxidizer turbopump. The main fuel tank of this stage is pressurized by bleeding hot hydrogen from the thrust-chamber fuel manifold downstream of the thrust-chamber cooling tubes. The pressure of both tanks can be regulated by pressure-switch/solenoid Gaseous Nitrogen to Main Fuel Tank

In both cases, flow-limiting orifices may be used in series for increased reliability with valve or regulator design biased to fail open.

The required propellant flow rate bled for va porization and main-tank pressurization will be determined by the main propellant flow rate at the pump inlet (or tank outlet) and by the heat- and mass-transfer processes within the main propellant tank, which in turn are influenced by pressurant and environmental temperatures. For a given rate of evaporation of the propellant in the tank, average flow rate through the tank vent, and tank ullage gas or vapor  condi t ion ,  the fo l lowing correlation can be established:

148 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES helium). The system design for this concept is similar to that of a propellant-evaporation system.

5.5 CHEMICAL-REACTION SYSTEMS

Pressurization systems using hot-gas products generated from solid or liquid propellants or cat alytic-reacted gases have been successfully developed for storable l iquid-propellant  engine systems. Another technique used with noncryogenics is the main-propellant-tank injection pressurization system. Here a hypergolic fluid is injected into the tank and pressurization is provided by the products of the reaction occurring within the tank.

These methods are not applicable to cryogenic propellants because the products of reaction, such as water, will solidify and because the heat of combustion will undesirably raise the bulk tempera ture of the cryogenic propellant. Especially in the case of liquid hydrogen, bulk heating cannot be tolerated because of its limited liquid range (normal boiling point to critical point).

Two important considerations for the application of combustion products for pressurization are propellant compatibility and gas temperature. Ex cept for very short operating durations (a few seconds), fuel-rich hot gases are used for fuel tanks to prevent reactions. Similarly, oxidizer-rich hot gases are applied to oxidizer tanks.

Solid-Propellant Gas Generators

Several effective solid-propellant gas generators have been developed to pressurize prepackaged, storable liquid propulsion systems. Gas temperatures up to
3000"F and tank pressures up to 2000 psia have been proven successful for short-duration applications. This pressurization method is primarily employed for its inherent simplicity, low production cost, long term storability, relatively light weight, and compact ness. The system is usually composed of two electri cally fired initiators, or squibs, a charge of igniter pellets, safety and arming devices, a pressure-relief regulator, and the propellant grains. A device to cool the hot gas may be required in specific applications.

Figure 5-9 shows a typical design. The gas-genera tor assembly is enclosed in an insulated steel housing within an aluminum casing, which in turn is an integral part of a propellant tank constructed of aluminum alloy. The gas-generator unit is completely integrated into a compact package ready, with minimum effort and maximum safety, for acceptance testing, storage, and installation into the propulsion system. All of the gas outlets are hermetically sealed with burst diaphragms to maintain system reliability even after long storage.

The ignition train starts the propellant grains burning and producing the pressurization gas. The burning rate of the grain, and in turn the pressure of a solid-propellant system, is affected by the grain bulk temperature. The grain is designed to produce the required gas pressure and flow rate at the lower initial environmental temperature-limit. When oper ating at a higher initial temperature, the pressure is maintained by a regulator that vents all excess gas overboard. The required grain charge is sized for the full operating duration at the upper temperature limit, which corresponds to the maximum grain burning rate.

GAS-PRESSURIZED PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 149

The selection and design of solid-propellant gas generator pressurization systems must consider po tential problem areas, notably the following:
chemical and temperature compatibility of the gas with the propellants; pressure-regulation difficulties;
solid particles carried by the gas clogging the system;
lack of restart capability; and requirement to vent gas rapidly in the event of premature engine cutoff.

Several commonly used solid-propellant systems may be described in brief as follows:

1) Gas generator without cooling, as shown schematically in Fig. 5-10, consists of a solid-propel lant grain, igniter, filter, and hot-gas regulator or ori fice. This system is mainly suitable for relatively short durations. Upon ignition, hot gas is fed through the filter, regulated, and ducted to the propellant tanks. The regulator dumps excess gas overboard, for which a vent line must be provided. As an alternate, an orifice may be installed in place of the regulator. In the latter case, the propellant-tank pressure and engine thrust level are functions of the gas-generator pressure, which in turn is a function of environmental temperature.

2) Gas generator with solid coolant, as shown in Fig. 5-11, consists of a solid-propellant grain and ig niter, a sublimating solid coolant, a filter, and a regulator. In operation, the hot gas is cooled as it passes through a bed of solid material, subjecting it to decomposition or sublimation. Thus, the cooling process simultaneously results in additional pressuri zation gas. The gas then passes through a filter, is regulated, and is ducted to the propellant tanks.

A typical design might use an ammonium nitrate base propellant with a theoretical flame temperature of 2320"F. Oxalic acid pressed into pellets--the solid coolant--decomposes endothermically at tempera tures above 250F, producing a mixture of CO, CO2, and H20. The desired temperature level of the mixed gas is achieved through selection of the propellant I,,F ,,i '~ ,,F .,,,," ,, J , / , , , '~,/ ....... ,]

400"F have been obtained.

3) Gas generator with azide cooling pack, as illus trated in Fig. 5-12, cools hot gas by passing it through a bed of azide material that decomposes and yields essentially pure nitrogen. However, the gas leaving the azide pack is often contaminated with metal particles from the decomposition of the azide. These have to be removed in a cyclone separator. The gas is filtered to remove any remaining particles, regu lated, and then directed to the propellant tanks. This pressurization system provides relatively pure nitrogen gas at a reasonable temperature (as low as
600"F).

4) Helium system with gas-generator heating, as shown in Fig. 5-13, consists of a high-pressure helium tank with a solid-propellant gas generator mounted internally, a filter, and a pressure regulator. The solid propellant grain provides both heat and additional pressurant gas. This system needs a relatively large high-pressure storage tank.

Liquid-Propellant Gas Generator

Both liquid-monopropellant and liquid-bipropellant gas generators have been used successfully for generating pressurant gas in systems with relatively long operating times. The selection and design of a gas-generation system must consider propellant compatibility, operating temperature limits of pro pellants and tank materials, and molecular weight of the gas.

Among monopropellants,  hydrazine is consid ered the most satisfactory with respect to chemical characteristics and molecular weight of the product gas. The decomposition products of hydrazine can

150 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES be made even lighter by catalytic decomposition of the ammonia. The gas contains no carbon, deposits of which could lower the heat transfer rate of a heat exchanger.  The theoretical gas-decomposi t ion temperature of pure hydrazine is 1800"F. Additives can be used to reduce the temperature.

To meet the requirement for compatibility with the propellant, bipropellant gas generators possess the flexibility of operation at either fuel- or oxidizer rich conditions. Thus, the same propellant combi nation can be used to produce both a fuel- and an oxidizer-compatible pressurant gas. For instance, nitrogen tetroxide in combination with hydrazine, UDMH, and various other amine fuels permits hypergolic starting and stable operation in either fuel- or oxidizer-rich modes.

Several avenues are open to meet the temper ature requirement of the pressurant gas. Both fuel and oxidizer-rich mixtures burn at values far from stoichiometric, resulting in lower temperatures. A limitation exists if one of the bipropellants is also a monopropellant ,  which continues to decompose exothermically. The cooling effect can also be obtained by injecting a given amount of noncom bustible liquid, which absorbs heat when evaporating, into the hot gas. A third method of cooling, transfering heat with one of the liquid propellants in a heat exchanger, can be applied with essentially any propellant combination, provided the cooling liquid can safely absorb the heat transfer from the gas.

The requirement of low molecular weight can be met by most fuel-rich gases if they are at ap proximately 1000"F, where the complex organic com pounds composing most fuels are cracked into simple gases of low molecular weight. If excess fuel is

Liquid-propellant gas generators require rela tively complex components and controls. The se lection and application of these will be determined mainly from mission requirements, such as long operating time and need for restarts. The following systems give an idea of applications.

1) Single gas-generator system with injection cooling provides pressurant gas for both the fuel and oxidizer tanks.

The second gas generator operates with excess oxidizer to produce relatively cool, oxidizer-rich gases that directly pressurize the main oxidizer tank. A design problem arises from the need to balance the output of the two gas generators and to provide proper pressure control in both tanks. Gas temperatures as low as 600F have been successfully generated with these systems.

Direct  Injection into Propellant Tank

The direct-injection systems employ injection of small quantities of fuel and oxidizer into the main oxidizer and fuel tanks, respectively. Hypergolic reaction produces the pressurizing gases within the main propellant tanks themselves. The fuel system
(Fig. 5-17) includes a small high-pressure helium storage tank, a helium-pressure regulator, and two small auxiliary propel lant  tanks from which propellants are injected into the main tanks. The series injection system (Fig. 5-18) consists of only one auxiliary oxidizer tank for main-fuel-tank pressur ization, or vice versa, instead of two separate auxiliary tanks. The series system takes advantage of the situa tion where one of the main propellant tanks can operate at a slightly lower pressure than the other. In the case shown in Fig. 5-18, a small quantity of the main fuel supply is fed through a regulator to the main oxidizer tank. Although these systems appear to offer the lightest and simplest method of pressuri zation by number of components, they present the designer with questions of system safety, reliability, and ability to produce steady, regulated tank pressures.

GAS-PRESSURIZED PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 153

5.6 SELECTION OF PRESSURIZATION

The inception of pressurization-system design begins with a preliminary study of the various design ap proaches. Although providing a technical basis for selection, this study can become a relatively complex task in view of the great number of tank-pressurization techniques that have been developed. The study will gather all information pertinent to the wide range of systems. The vehicle configuration and requirements for performance, structural materials, and other factors affecting the pressurization system design will likewise be accumulated to permit valid weight and size comparisons of the various systems.

The five principal selection criteria are mission and vehicle requirements, fluid and material compatibility, system reliability, cost, and system weight and size. Mission and vehicle requirements include storability, system start and restart, and pressure and flow tolerances. Compatibility includes chemical inertness, freedom from excessively condensible and soluble gas products, and proper pressurant temperature level. Reliability is evaluated on the basis of system complexity and failure modes. Components that can be expected to require considerable development effort to achieve satis factory reliability include gas-generator assemblies, thrust-chamber heat exchangers, and regulators. The gross weight of the pressurization system is treated as inert weight, since the pressurant gas is part of the vehicle weight at the end of the expulsion cycle.

A sample preliminary-design study was con ducted for the tank-pressurization system for the A-4
Stage propulsion system. The vehicle mission was assumed to require single-start, constant-thrust, full duration operations. The study compared eight different pressurization systems (Table 5-1). The column "Complex Component Designs" refers to parts requiring relatively long development time and high production cost.



Design of Turbopump Propellant Feed Systems

Chapter 6

For high-thrust, long-duration liquid-propellant rock et engines, the use of turbopump-fed systems usually lowers system weight and raises performance as compared to pressurized-gas fed systems. Turbo pump-fed systems require only relatively low pump inlet pressures, and thus propellant-tank pressures, while the major portion of the pressure required at the thrust-chamber inlets is supplied by the pumps. This saves considerable tank weight, particularly in large vehicles.

As the overall trend toward higher chamber pressure for liquid-propellant rocket engines con tinues, the role of turbopumps in an engine system becomes of greater importance, particularly with the high-performance hydrogen-fueled engines. The ad vantage of pump-fed over pressure-fed engines increases as mission velocity requirements increase, and becomes very substantial as orbit-insertion velocities are approached.

Figure 6-1 shows a representative range of pump operating parameters for various liquid-propellant rocket engine applications. Figure 6-2 depicts an envelope of power requirements for a number of actual turbine designs.

6.1 ELEMENTS OF TURBOPUMP-FED SYSTEMS

The vehicle designer must insure that propellants go to the inlet of the pumps at required minimum pressures. The turbopump feed system raises the pressure of the propellants received from the vehicle tanks and delivers them to the main thrust chamber, through ducts and valves, at pressures and flow rates commensurate with rated engine operation. A turbo pump feed system may consist of the following basic elements:

 Propellant pumps.
 Turbine(s) to.drive them.
 Power source for the turbine(s) (during engine start as well as main stage).
 Speed-reduction gear transmissions (if any).
 Lubrication system for bearings and gears.
 Accessory drives.
 Propellant inlet and discharge ducts.
 Turbopump mounts.

Propellant Pumps

The principal requirements of a rocket-engine propellant pump are high reliability, low cost, light weight, stable flow for the required operating range, high efficiency, adequate suction performance, and long life. The relative importance of these factors and their resulting influence on the design will vary depending on the application. The most widely used pump types are centrifugal (or radial), axial, or mixed flow. Centrifugal pumps are usually designed with a single stage; axial pumps, multistage. However, multistage centrifugal pumps with crossover-type dif fusion systems have also been used effectively. Various pump configurations are shown schemat ically in Fig. 6-3.

Centrifugal pumps. Almost all operational rocket propellant pumps are of this type. They can handle large flows at high pressures efficiently as well as economically in terms of weight and size. The elements of a centrifugal pump are shown in Fig. 6-4
and 6-16. Centrifugal pumps, like other steady-flow rotating machinery, consist essentially of two basic elements: the rotor and the stator. These accelerate the fluid flow by imparting kinetic energy to it in the rotor and then decelerating, or "diffusing," it in the

The stator assembly consists of a casing with stationary diffuser vanes, a volute with discharge outlet, and seals.

An inducer, an axial-flow rotor, increases total pressure of the entering fluid sufficiently to permit noncavitating operation of the main impeller. An inducer can reduce the pump-inlet-pressure net pos itive suction head (NPSH) requirements substantially. The impeller of a centrifugal (or radial) pump basically is a rotating wheel with blades that dis charge the flow in a radial direction. Fluid is admitted axially to the impeller that, when rotating in an enclosure, ejects it at the per iphery with increased absolute velocity (Fig. 6-4).

As primary functions, the pump stator assembly diffuses (i.e., decelerates) the fluid to convert the velocity head into pressure head, collecting and redirecting the fluid to the pump discharge outlet, and provides structural support  and a pressure enclosure for the pump. Wear rings (see Fig. 6-4)
provide axial-thrust control and minimize internal leakage--circulation of the fluid between the high pressure (discharge) and the low-pressure (inlet or suction) zones. Dynamic shaft seals prevent external leakage along the shaft.

Multistage centrifugal pumps .  For higher pressure rises, multiplestage centrifugal pumps can be designed if a single stage proves limited. A multistage pump basically resembles a single-stage pump, except that it requires proper channeling of



T U R B O P U M P  PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 157

the fluid between stages. Figure 6-5 shows such a design used on the Space Shuttle Main Engine
(SSME) high-pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP).

Multistage axial pumps. This design permits achieving high head through multiple staging with smaller-diameter pumps. It has been used for liquid hydrogen pump applications. It is not as well suited for wide-flow-range operation, as will be discussed below, but can be more efficient in applications requiring relatively high ratios of flow vs. head (or at high "specific speeds," a term to be defined below). Elements of an axial-flow pump are shown in Fig. 6-6. The rotor assembly consists of an inducer, a cylin drical rotor with multiple rows of rotating blades, and a rotor shaft. The stator assembly includes a cylindrical casing with rows of stationary blades spaced between inducer and rotating blades, a volute casing, beatings, and seals.

An inducer placed at the pump inlet supplies the fluid to the main-pump section at the required pressure and velocity. Both rotor and stator blades have a hydrofoil shape. The rotor blades accelerate the flow relative to the stator and thus increase the kinetic energy of the fluid, while the stator blades, acting as diffusers, convert the velocity head of the fluid into pressure head. However, the velocity vector of the fluid in the axial direction is kept essentially constant throughout the various stages of the pump.

Inducer pumps.  The simplest axial-flow pump consists of a single rotor designed as an inducer to achieve good suction, as shown in Fig. 6-7. The inducer can consist of either a single- or double blade row, an example of the latter being shown in Fig. 6-8. These pumps are used as low-speed "boost pumps" to raise the pressure sufficiently to permit the main pump to operate at much higher speeds to reduce its size and cost. The inducer design for this pump is similar to those used in either centrifugal or axial-flow pumps.

Turbines

The turbines (see Fig. 6-9 and 6-16) that provide shaft power to the propellant pumps typically derive their energy from the expansion of a high-pressure, high temperature gas to lower pressures and temperatures. Turbines can be divided into two major types:
impulse and reaction. Impulse turbines can be either single- or multiple-stage.  Reaction turbines are usually multistage. Impulse turbines are most fre quently used for high-pressure-ratio, low-flow appli cations. Reaction-bladed turbines are more frequent ly used for low-pressure-ratio, high-flow designs.

Single-stage, single-rotor impulse turbine. This turbine consists of a single-rotor disk or turbine wheel to which is attached a row of turbine blades or buckets. Gas is fed to the rotating blades through stationary nozzles (Fig. 6-10). In the nozzles, the gas pressure is converted into kinetic energy (velocity head) with attendant static-pressure drop. The gas flow reaches maximum velocity upon entering the rotating blades, where the kinetic energy of the gas is imparted to the turbine rotor as mechanical energy of rotation. Ideally, the static pressure of the gas remains constant when it passes through the rotating blades (except for the effects of friction).

Velocity-compounded impulse turbine. In this type of turbine, as shown schematically in Fig. 6 11, two separate rows of rotating blades instead of one transfer the kinetic energy of the gas discharged from the set of stationary nozzles. A row of stationary blades between the wheels guides the gas into the

second set of moving blades. Ideally, the entire pressure drop occurs in the stationary nozzles. The gas velocity decreases during passage through the first row of rotating blades, remains constant through the stationary blades, and decreases further as it passes through the second row of rotating blades. Ve loc i ty -compounded  turbines  are cons ide red single-stage because they involve only one pressure step.

Pressure-compounded impulse turbine. As shown schematically .... in  Fig. 6-12, this turbine expands the gas in Steps, through two or more rows or stages of stationary nozzles, each set being followed by a row of rotating blades. A designer wants velocity, and thus the kinetic energy, of the gas flow to be the same at the entrance of each row of

Fig. 6-8 Two-blade-row inducer. rotating blades. This results in equal  energy transferred to each rotating-blade row, while the pressure drop in each stationary nozzle row will vary. Since the pressure is greater in region A than in region B, it is necessary to separate the stages by a sealing diaphragm to prevent bypass flows (Fig. 6-9). Because of clearances required at the rotating seal between diaphragm and turbine shaft, however, some losses do occur at this point due to leakage from stage to stage.

Reaction turbine. An impulse and a reaction turbine (shown schematically in Fig. 6-13) have this main difference: an impulse turbine sees no static pressure drop (no expansion) while the gas passes

Both impulse and reaction wheels are driven by a change in momentum of the gas. In a pure reaction type turbine, the driving force is derived entirely from the reaction due to gas expansion within the rotating blades (similar to the gas expansion in a rocket nozzle). In actual reaction-turbine designs, however, a portion of the driving force comes from gas impingement on the rotating blades. The percent reaction is the ratio of the static-pressure decrease across the rotor divided by the pressure drop across both the nozzle and rotor expressed as a percentage. Thus, a 50%-reaction design has equal pressure drops of Motiol Stationary Row

Hydraulic turbines. Occasionally it will be more economical in the engine system to use the high-pressure liquid from the pump discharge to drive a hydraulic turbine which derives its energy from the pressure drop across the turbine rather than the temperature of the driving gaseous fluids. The turbine shown in Fig. 6-7 does this to simplify sealing requirements by using liquid oxygen as the

Turbine Power Sources

Several different types of engine cycle are available and can be classified primarily based on where the turbine-drive fluid originates and where it is dis charged after leaving the turbine. The typical turbine power  sources shown in Fig. 6-14 are described briefly here.

Biprope l lan t  gas  g e n e r a t o r .  This was the most widely used system before 1970 since it has the advantage of using the engine main propellants, and the turbine circuit is in parallel with the thrust chamber flow. The turbine-drive fluid consists of hot gas from the combustion process in the gas genera tor. The turbine flow is subsequent ly  dumped overboard  or to some low-pressure point. This system obviously operates with a high pressure ratio and low flowrate to minimize impact on engine specific impulse. The turbine for this system will typically be an impulse supersonic design.

Monoprope l lan t  gas  genera to r .  This pro vides the simplest gas-generating system, but it

Thrust-chamber bleed. As applied in "tapofP'
engine systems, gases will be bled off directly from the main combustion chamber to drive the turbine. The gas has an elevated temperature  from the combustion process in the main chamber. Since the turbine-dr ive fluid is dumped  overboard  after leaving the turbine, this type of design is similar to those used for the gas-generator system.

Expander .  In an expander cycle, such as with a hydrogen-fueled engine system, the heated hydrogen gas emerging from the thrust-chamber cooling jacket is used as the turbine working fluid before being injected into the main combust ion chamber.  In systems using a mono-propellant as one of the main propellants,  the monopropel lan t  can be decom posed and used to drive the turbine prior to injection into the main combustion chamber.

Dual  ( s taged)  combus t ion .  Here the entire fuel flow reacts with a portion of the oxidizer in a bipropropellant gas generator and thus provides the gas to drive the turbine. The usually fuel-rich exhaust gas is then ducted into the main combust ion chamber and reacts with the balance of the oxidizer. The turbine-discharge flow goes to the thrust cham ber, resulting in a similar turbine design as the expander cycle, but at higher temperature. Staged combustion-cycle efficiency equals that of the ex pander cycle. The SSME engine is of this type. A variation of this cycle is to use an oxidizer-rich gas turbine for the oxidizer pump and a fuel rich turbine for the fuel pump.

Most systems require an auxiliary power source during engine start to drive the turbine until the main power  source takes over. Evaluating start methods on a new engine usually calls for compar ison between a spin and a tank-head start. A spin start uses an auxiliary power source to provide the initial buildup of turbine speed. A tank-head start uses propellants out of the main tanks for initial turbine power. As the speed increases, pump-dis charge pressures increase, and the turbine flow and available power  increase, resulting in the engine bootstrapping itself to mainstage. The primary fac

(kerosene) and the hydrazines. Since storables do not gasify at low pressures, relatively high initial flowrates can be obtained under tank-head condi tions. This makes a tank-head start a reasonable option. Spin starts have also been used where stored high-pressure gas, a solid-propellant gas generator, or bipropellant start tanks generate the initial turbine power. Using a spin start will usually require less development  but at the expense of the additional components .

Cryogenic-fuel; gas-generator cycle. All cryo genic pump-fed engines have used hydrogen for the fuel. The following discussion concerns using hydro gen, but would also apply for other cryogenic fuels. At mainstage, a gas-generator cycle tends to have a high turbine pressure-ratio. For a tank-head start, the initial turbine pressure-ratio will be lower than mainstage because the initial pressure driving the turbine has to be lower than the engine fuel-inlet pressure. This results in a relatively low initial power and a slow rate of bootstrap. Also, because hydro gen vaporizes easily at low pressure, it is difficult to get enough hydrogen flow to prevent temperature spikes in the gas generator. This makes a tank-head start very difficult. The gas-generator cycle does lend itself fairly easily to a spin start because only a small portion of the total hydrogen goes to the gas generator. During the spin portion of start, the main fuel valve will be open, providing a path for the main fuel flow to prevent stalling of the main fuel pump. Initial combustion for a spin start will be at a significantly higher pressure than a tank-head start, and will therefore reduce the likelihood of turbine inlet temperature spikes. Thus, a spin start will usu ally be recommended for hydrogen-fueled engines with a gas generator.

Cryogenic fuel,, expander cycle. An expander cycle engine has a relatively low turbine pressure ratio at mainstage because the turbine flow goes into the main combustion chamber. During start, prior to main-chamber prime, there is very low back-pres sure. As a result, a tank-head start will be a turbine pressure-ratio equal to or higher than mainstage. This produces a high turbine power for a relatively rapid speed-buildup. Also, the expander  does not have any combustion upstream of the turbines, so temperature spikes are not a problem. This cycle should therefore be fairly easy to tank-head start. It is also difficult to spin start because a significant



162 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES portion of the fuel-pump flow goes through the tur bine. Therefore,  a high turbine-inlet  pressure generated by a spin system restricts the fuel-pump flow, resulting in a low flow-coefficient. Because a hydrogen pump is very susceptible to stall and boil out at low flow, this cycle should use a tank-head start.

Cryogenic fuel; staged-combustion engine. In the staged-combustion engine, most of the fuel flow is used by the turbines; therefore it has the same potential fuel-pump stall problem (for a spin start)
as the expander cycle. The tank-head start has the difficult p r o b l e m  of p reven t ing  turb ine- in le t temperature spikes at low flowrates. Even though dif ficult, tank-head start is used for the staged-combus tion cycle, but start temperature spikes can lead to turbine-blade damage.  They can force use of coatings for thermal protection.

Turbopump-Drive Arrangements

The specific type of coupling between turbine and pumps depends not only upon the propellants being pumped but also on the design of the overall engine system. Various turbopump-drive arrangements are shown schematically in Fig. 6-15. Where a single turbine directly drives both  propel lant  pumps through a common shaft, it can be located either on the shaft end (with back-to-back pump arrangement)
or between pumps. Then both pumps and turbine will operate at the same shaft speed. Gear-driven turbopump arrangements include the pancake type, which uses different reduction gears and is applied where there are speed differentials between pumps and turbine; the offset turbine, with both pumps on one shaft but driven through a gear train; and the single-geared pump where one pump is mounted with the turbine on the same shaft, while the other is driven through a reduction gear. Dual-shaft tur bopump arrangements with pump and turbine for each propellant on separate shafts include two gas turbines in series, with the discharge gas from the first turbine driving the second turbine, and two gas turbines in parallel, both receiving gas directly from the power source.

Description of Developed Turbopump Systems

Figure 6-16 shows the major elements of a typical geared liquid-bipropellant turbopump system for a rocket engine. Developed for a 188,000-1b-thrust LOX/RP-1 booster engine, this dua l -pump unit consists of oxidizer pump, fuel pump, reduction gearbox, accessory drive adapter, and a turbine. The turbine is started by hot gases from a turbine spinner
(solid-propellant gas generator) and powered from a l iquid-propellant gas generator during mainstage. The turbine shaft drives a series of reduction gears, which in turn drive the pump shaft. The turbopump gears and bearings are cooled and lubricated either by a separate oil-supply system or by a fuel-additive subsystem. During mainstage operation, the turbo pump supplies oxidizer and fuel to the main thrust chamber as well as to the gas generator at the re quired pressures and flow rates. Table 6-1 lists oper ating characteristics and materials of construction for this turbopump.

Both oxidizer and fuel pumps are of single-entry, centrifugal-flow type. They are mounted back-to-back on a c o m m o n  shaft, one on each side of the gearbox. The fuel pump is bolted to the gearbox,

164 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES while the oxidizer pump is secured to it by radially inserted steel pins. These pins allow the oxidizer pump housing to expand and contract during extreme temperature changes without distortion and misalignment. Each pump has an axial-flow inducer, a radial-flow impeller with backward curved vanes, stationary diffuser vanes, and a volute. The diffuser vanes and volute are designed to achieve uniform pressure at the outer diameter of the impeller to minimize radial loads. Balance ribs on the back side of the impellers neutralize pump-shaft axial thrust.

The gearbox includes a series of full-depth re duction spur gears with integral-bearing inner races, gear carrier and main-shaft bearings, accessory drives, pump-shaft bearing seals, and a bearing heater on the oxidizer-pump shaft. A drain manifold handles horizontal drainage. The gears reduce the speed of rotation between turbine and pump shaft by an overall ratio of 4.88 to 1. Details of typical turbopump gears and bearings are shown in Fig. 6-17. The pump shaft turns clockwise as viewed from the oxidizer pump. The sequence of power transmission goes from turbine to high-speed pinion gear then and to pump-shaft gear. Power is also transmitted to a main accessory-drive gear from a drive pinion gear mounted on the intermediate gear shaft.

The turbinewan impulse-type, two-stage pres sure-compounded unit (Fig. 6-12) bolted to the fuel pump housing--consists of a hot-gas inlet manifold, stationary nozzles and vanes, first- and second-stage turbine wheels, a turbine shaft, and a splined quill shaft connecting the turbine shaft to the high-speed pinion gear. The turbine shaft is supported on the inboard side by a ball bearing; on the outboard side, by a roller bearing. Carbon-ring shaft seals prevent hot-gas leaks. The turbine-inlet manifold distributes the gases to the first row of stationary nozzles. They, in turn, distribute the gases to the first row of rotating blades. When leaving these, the gases again increase velocity when passing through the second row of stationary nozzles. They finally pass through the second row of rotating blades and leave the turbine through an exhaust duct. A sealing diaphragm be tween the first and second turbine wheel prevents the hot gas from bypassing the second row of stationary nozzles.

Figure 6-18 shows a direct-drive liquid-oxygen turbopump for a dual-shaft turbopump system. The main pump element, a double-suction design, has a rotor consisting of mirror-image inducers and back to-back centrifugal impellers. The flow splits equally in the inlet, flows through the inducers and im pellers, and is rejoined at the impeller outer diam eter, subsequently flowing through the vaned diffuser and volute. As can be seen in Table 6-2, this pump has a discharge pressure at rated power level of 4100
psi, but 9.3% of the oxygen flow is tapped off downstream of the main pump and sent through the small centrifugal "kick" pump, which raises the pressure to 6952 psi. The shaft system rotates on duplex ball bearings, which are cooled b y  a positive flow of the liquid oxygen from the pump.

The turbine-drive gas comes from a preburner system, the turbopump being used on a staged combustion-cycle engine. The turbine, a two-stage axial-flow reaction design, has a small reaction rate to help minimize axial loads. A mixture of liquid hydrogen and hot gas cools the turbine disks and housing to attain structural integrity. The turbine drive fluid is prevented from mixing with the liquid oxygen by a complex seal package consisting of a main LOX seal, double-floating-ring intermediate seal with an interior helium purge, and a double Bearing No. 1

6.2 TURBOPUMP SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND DESIGN PARAMETERS

Being closely related, variation of the turbopump design and operating parameters will contribute to the optimization of both turbopump and engine system performance. The design procedure for the turbopump system includes evaluation of all possible design approaches and mechanical configurations that can satisfy engine system specifications. From this will be selected the best design with respect to overall systems reliability and performance. Further discussion of this subject can be found in Ref. 6-1.

Turbopump System Performance

Turbopump performance affects the vehicle payload in three way~,:

1) Turbopump component weight. Since the turbopump components form part of stage burnout weight, they directly affect stage payload.

2) Required pump-inlet suction pressure. Re quired suction pressure directly translates into re quired main-propellant-tank pressure level. Suction pressure raised, tank and pressurization-system weights increase and thus reduce the stage payload for a given burnout weight.

3) Turbine-gas flowrate. For gas-generator cycles, the turbine-drive gases are usually ejected at a lower specific impulse than the thrust-chamber gases. Their flowrate decreases the overall Is of the engine system and thus for a given velocity increment it decreases the allowable stage-burnout weight. For a fixed weight of engines, tanks, guidance, and other equipment, a decrease in allowable stage-burnout weight decreases payload weight.

Turbopump System Design Parameters

In the design of turbopump systems, the following parameters, often interdependent, are considered paramount: propellant properties, pump-developed heads and flowrates, pump specific speeds, pump net positive suction head (NPSH), pump efficiencies, overall performance and operating efficiency of turbine, turbopump-system cycle efficiency, and turbopump-system calibration and off-design charac teristics. No simple rules are available for optimizing the correlations of these parameters when designing a specific type of turbopump for a given engine

combustion products. systems application. Generally speaking, however, available pump suction pressure together with the basic pump flow characteristics will determine the maximum shaft speed at which the unit can operate. The higher this shaft speed, the lower the turbopump weight will likely be. Once the pump speed is deter mined, turbine type, turbine driving arrangement, and turbine power source will be selected on the basis of efficiency, weight, simplicity, and other factors.

Propellant properties. General data for some propellants used in liquid-rocket engines are given in Tables 1-3 to 1-5. Table 6-3 lists properties of commonly used liquid propellants that have specific significance in the design of pumps. These propellants include earth-storable liquids such as RP 1 and N204, cryogenics such as LO2 and LH2, and liquids having a wide range of physical and chemical properties.

The low temperature of cryogenic liquids im poses design limitations that must be addressed in the selection of materials, seals, bearings, and lubricants. For example, the temperature is low enough to freeze any water vapor present, creating ice that can damage parts or cause them to mal function. The total temperature range to which the structural elements of a cryogenic turbopump may be exposed varies from-300 to -430"F at the pumps to 1200 to 1700F at the turbine. This induces temperature gradients between the various turbo pump components that must be accommodated, and requires structural flexibility or suitable devices to

permit the required thermal expansion and contrac tion. Radial connecting pins are often employed to permit a cryogenic pump to contract independently of a turbine and of a normal-temperature pump.

The vapor pressure of the propellants under normal engine operation conditions directly in fluences total suction-pressure requirements at the pump inlet. This will be further discussed in con junction with the pump-inlet net positive suction head (NPSH).

The density variations of different propellants produce substantially different pump headrise re quirements, as well as large differences in volume flow. The power required per unit weight flow and pressure rise of a pump is inversely proportional to the density of the fluid--dramatically evident in'the case of liquid hydrogen, which has a density of less than 10% of that of other propellants. For the same weight flow and pressure rise, a liquid-hydrogen pump requires more than 10 times the volume flow and driving power of other propellant pumps. Thus the design of l iquid-hydrogen pumps requires specific considerations.

The viscosity of the pumped fluids effects a boundary layer along the surface of the flow passages within the pump. There is a minimum size of the impeller cross-section below which pump perfor mance will fall off rapidly. As the passage clearances in the impeller are decreased, a point will be reached where the flow is predominantly boundary layer, and viscous forces rather than turbulent forces become predominant. This completely changes the performance of a pump. The drag effect of the boundary layers, together with the rotation of the fluid in certain pump passages (such as in the impeller of a centrifugal pump), results in secondary flows being set up. These flows, together with friction losses (also in direct proportion to the viscosity of the fluid) and leakage losses, constitute a major portion of the energy losses in a pump. A high propellant viscosity tends to lower pump efficiency.

Some liquid propellants, such as LF 2 and N2H4, are highly reactive chemically and are thermally unstable beyond certain temperature limits. In the design of turbopumps for these propellants, special consideration must be given to the selection of compatible materials as well as to the construction of mechanical  parts. Seals, bearings, and the protection ( insulat ion)of the pump section against heat influx from the turbine section following engine shutdown are typical problem areas.

Pump-deve loped  heads and f l o w  rates. The pump adds energy to the fluid preferably in the form of higher discharge static-pressure. The term "pump developed head" (DH), defined as the difference between pump-discharge total head and pump suction head, represents the energy added per pound of pumped fluid expressed as a change in enthalpy with units of ft-lb/lb, which is typically shortened to units of "ft." For an incompressible fluid, developed fluid pressure lap (psi)] and fluid head ,[AH (ft)] have this relationship:

AH = 144 Ap/(fluid density) (6-1)

where Ap is in units of psi and density is in units of lb/ft3. For a fluid like hydrogen that has a degree of compressibility, the head is typically defined as the isentropic enthalpy rise from inlet conditions to the discharge pressure. The specific head/pressure relationship is dependent  on the fluid-thermo dynamic state conditions. For small pressure changes (e.g., less than 1000 psi), the incompressible relationship shown above can generally be used as a first approximation.

The required pump-developed head at the design propellant flowrate (i.e., engine thrust level) is dictated by the sum of the hydraulic resistances within the engine's propellant-flow system. These resistances include the pressure drops across in jector, thrust-chamber manifold, cooling jacket, propellant valves and ducts, as well as the thrust chamber  pressure. In addition, for the staged combustion cycle and the expander-cycle engine, pressure differential across the turbine must be provided for in the pump-discharge pressure. Figure
6-19 shows an engine propellant-flow-system hy draulic-resistance curve representing the resistance head to flowrate relationship at various pump operating levels.

The head is developed by the rotating members imparting energy to the fluid primarily in the form of kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is then converted by the stationary members into pressure energy. The magnitude of the developed head for a given design is a function of both the pump speed and flow. The head is generally expressed by a head-flow (H-Q) characteristic at one or more constant values of speed, as shown in Fig. 6-19. At high flows, the pump-drive energy is consumed by internal flow losses, and the head rise decreases to zero. At the other extreme, as flow decreases the head continues to increase, at least at first. It can then level off, begin slowly to decrease, or, in some cases, drop off dramatically due to phenomena known as stall. That unstable condition, discussed below, must be avoided to achieve constant pump

168 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES operation. Increasing speed increases the head by the speed-squared relationship provided the ratio of f low/speed can be maintained constant. This is strictly true only for an incompressible fluid, but approximately valid even for a compressible liquid like hydrogen.

Two dimensionless coefficients are frequently used to indicate the head and flow characteristics of a given pump: pump head coefficient ~ and pump flow coefficient @. The pump head coefficient is the ratio of rated pump head (ft) to the maximum theoretical head at zero flow for meridional (axial)
inlet (no prerotation), expressed as follows:

= AH/(U22/g) (6-2)

where- = overall pump head coefficient at rated de sign point (range is 0.4 to 0.7 for a single stage centrifugal pump and 0.2 to 0.4 for a single-stage axial pump)

AH = pump rated developed head, ft U2 = mean tip velocity of pump impeller at rated design rotating speed, ft/s g = gravitational constant, 32.2 ft/s2

The pump flow coefficient @ can be defined based either on inlet or discharge conditions, each as a ratio of the average meridional velocity (cm) in ft/s divided by a tip speed U in ft/s (that is, ~ = cm/U). The inlet flow coefficient uses inlet velocity based on the flow and the geometric area from the first rotor inlet tip to the hub. The value of U is based on the inducer tip diameter, if present, or the impeller eye diameter (tip diameter at the inlet of the blade). For the discharge flow coefficient, the average merid ional velocity at the impeller discharge is used together with the tip speed at the impeller exit. Inlet flow coefficients for rocket-engine pumps typically range from 0.07 to 0.30. Discharge flow coefficients range from 0.01 to 0.15.

Pump specific speeds. For any given pump design, the relation between fluid flow rate Q, de veloped fluid head AH, required driving power hp, and rotating speed N can be defined by three expressions called the affinity laws of a pump. These laws state:

1) Pump volume flowrate varies directly with speed:

Q1/Q2 = N1/N2 (6-3a)

2) Pump-developed bead varies directly as the square of the speed..

AH1/AtH2--- N12/N22 (6-3b)

3) Pump driving power varies directly as a cube of the speed:

hpl /hp2 - N13/N23 (6-3c)

The affinity laws are based on the assumption that the pump efficiency is independent of the rotating speed. Actual pump operation has shown, however, that pump efficiency does change with speed. The degree depends on the individual pump design and the pumped fluid. Most rocket-engine propellants are basically incompressible and show less than 2 or 3%
change in efficiency over a wide speed range. Thus the pump affinity laws hold quite well in most cases. Because much more strongly affected by speed, hydrogen pumps need efficiency calculated by a thermodynamic model of the pump system at the desired speeds.

The relationships established in Eq. (6-3a), (6 3b), and (6-3c) permit deriving a useful pump-design parameter, the pump stage specific speed, NS:

Ns = N(Q)0.5/(AH)0.75 (6-4)

where- NS - pump specific speed N = pump rotating speed, rpm Q = pump flowrate, gpm

AH = pump-developed head in a given stage

Pump specific speed is a characteristic value typically defined at the point of maximum efficiency, which is usually the design point. In pump design, this term is very useful to classify inducers or impellers on the basis of both performance and geometric proportions regardless of the actual size or speed at which they operate. NS, a function of design configuration, does not vary significantly for a series of geometrically similar impellers (having the same angles and proportions), or for a particular impeller operating at any speed.

Figure 6-20 indicates typical pump specific speeds for various impeller geometries. For a given speed, a low value of specific speed is characteristic for low-volume flow, high-headrise pumps. Higher specific speed indicates a higher-volume-flow, low head-rise pump.

Radial-type impel ler .  The head is largely developed by action of centrifugal force. This radial type is used for specific-speed from 500 to 1200. Geometric proportion (r2/rl) varies from 2 to 3.

Francis-type impeller.  This type has an axial inlet and a radial discharge, and is used for lower heads. Specific speed generally ranges from 1000 to
2400. Geometric proportion (r2/rl) varies from 1.3 to
1.8. The Francis type is most representative of rocket-engine pumps. r2

Mixed- f low- type  impel ler .  The head de veloped in this impeller is due partly to change in tangential velocity and partly to change in fluid velocity relative to the rotor. Discharge is partly radial and partly axial. The impeller blades are doubly curved. Specific speed varies from 2200 to
3500.

Propeller-type impeller.  The head developed by this type is through push of the vanes only. Flow direction is axial. Specific speeds range from 3000 to
6000 for multi-stage impellers, and from 6000 to
12,000 for inducers.

Pump net pos i t ive  suction head (NPSH);
cavitation. Allowing the static pressure of the fluid at the pump inlet or any regions within the pump to drop below the local fluid vapor-pressure level will cause these regions to cavitate; i.e., the fluid will pass from liquid to vapor and form bubbles. The for mation of vapor alters the effective flow passages of the fluid and can seriously affect normal pump performance.  The subsequent  collapse of these vapor regions creates local pressure forces that can cause flow instabilities and/or substantial damage.

To avoid cavitation during operat ion of a propel lant  pump, the pump-inlet  available net positive suction head (NPSH)a, furnished by the propellant-feed system upstream of the pump, must be higher  than the suction head above the propellant vapor pressure at which cavitation would begin. (NPSH)a is the difference between the propel lant inlet total pressure head and the propellant vapor pressure, expressed as follows:

(NPSH)a = (144/9) [Pt- Apf- Pv] + Z (6-5)

Alternatively, total pressure at the pump inlet given by Ptl, NPSH can be simply expressed as NPSHa - (Ptl - pv)144/p (6-6)

In design practice, the term "critical net positive suction head" (NPSH)c defines the NPSH value that will result in a 2% head-generation loss at the rated design speed and flow rate of a given pump. (Some references use a 3% head falloff rather than 2%.)
Usually further reduction in inlet NPSH below the
(NPSH)c point results in rapidly increasing cavi tation. In turn, the developed head is further reduced, bringing on nonsteady flow. Figure 6-21
represents the cavitation characteristics of a typical pump operated at rated design speed. Although the head produced by the pump remains relatively constant down to the critical NPSH, there may be significant cavitation occurring in the pump that can produce other effects. This is particularly true of inducers, which are designed to operate with cav itation. However, the cavitation can produce physical damage to the hardware and increase oscillations of both flow and pressure in the pump. It is not uncommon to be able to visually see cavitation in inducers at NPSH values that are several times the



170 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES critical, and the oscillations are typically noticeable in the range from one to two times the critical. These effects are dependent  on the design, and it is not necessary, in general, to eliminate all cavitation to achieve a good design even for applications re quiring long life. In fact, most rocket-engine pumps operate with cavitation to minimize weight. Below the critical NPSH, surging flow can occur or pump speed can run away due to the loss of head in the pump. Operation below this value must be carefully monitored.

To ensure a margin of safety for pump opera tion, the (NPSH)a supplied by the vehicle must be larger than the (NPSH) c of the propellant pumps. The margin to be used will depend on the applica tion. General guidelines are presented in the section on inducer design.

It is useful to compare the suction characteristics of various pump designs on the basis of a design parameter called suction specific speed Nss, which is defined as follows:

where- Nss

N Q

(NPSH)c

Nss = N(Q)0.5/(NPSH)c0.75 (6-7)

= pump suction specific speed
= pump rated design speed, rpm
= pump rated design volume flow rate, gpm
= pump critical net positive suction head, ft

Suction specific speed is related to the critical net positive suction head in the same manner the specific speed is related to overall pump-developed head. Design values of suction specific speeds for rocket-propellant pumps range from 10,000 without inducers to values over 100,000 for certain propel lants with inducers.

Another coefficient describing pump suction characteristics, the Thoma parameter r, is the ratio of critical net positive suction head (NPSH)c and rated pump-developed head AH:

r = (NPSH)c/AH = (Ns/Nss)1.333 (6-8)

This parameter is not commonly used today because it does not represent a common pump character istic.

For a given vehicle (NPSH)a, the pump suction characteristics Nss determine the maximum permis sible rpm at the design flowrate. A high pump Nss capability or a high vehicle (NPSH)a permits a high er pump rpm, lower turbopump weight, and possibly higher turbine performance.  It is desirable to operate a pump at the highest practical speed. Figure
6-22 represents the results of a parametric turbo pump-system design study for a typical LO2/RP-1
booster-stage rocket, such as the A-1 Stage engine. The study reflects the effects of N, (NPSH)c, and Nss on the selection of turbopump configuration.

In addition to the pump (NPSH)c values during steady-state operation, the engine starting transient pump (NPSH)c must be determined and specified t~
permit satisfactory pump acceleration from zero to nominal design speed and flow rate in the desired time and manner. The starting (NPSH)c depends on the rate of acceleration and on the control system of the engine, as well as on vehicle acceleration, gravity effects, and propellant-suction-duct geometry. There fore, sufficient tank pressure must be provided to accelerate the propellant and to overcome the hydraulic resistance in the suction duct, as well as to supply the necessary pump (NPSH)c during all phases of system operation. Similarly, the NPSH dur ing shutdown transients must be sufficient to permit a safe shutdown without a turbopump-overspeed condition.

Pump operational efficiency; l o s s e s .  Several types of energy loss occuring during pump operation affect efficiency.

Hydraulic losses. These include friction losses in the passages and flow-turbulence losses. The friction losses are a function of the "wetted areas" in the passages and of the roughness of their surfaces. The turbulence losses are caused by disturbances in certain regions of the pump, such as at the inlet and outlet edge of the vanes of both impeller and diffuser and in the return guide-vanes. Flow in pump components  is essentially always diffusing (lower relative velocity at the exit plane than at the inlet for a given blade row), which has associated losses. Tip clearance flows contribute losses in unshrouded regions. Cavitation in flow passages can increase these losses by causing local accelerations plus adding the losses associated with the cavitation collapse mechanism.

Disk-friction losses. The energy required to rotate a disk, such as an impeller or inducer, in a fluid is known as disk-friction loss. The disk-friction losses are due to two actions: the actual friction of fluid on the disk, which is relatively minor, and a pumping action on the fluid in contact with the disk, whereby the fluid is circulated locally by centrifugal action. The energy loss due to disk friction is transformed into heat and can appreciably increase the temperature of the fluid.

Mechanical losses. These are losses in bearings and seals caused by mechanical friction.

Leakage losses. To prevent the pumped fluid from leaking back to the inlet after it has exited the impeller and is at outlet-pressure levels, close clearance seals or wearing rings are provided. Increases in leakage require pumping power and introduce heat into the inlet fluid; both contribute to a loss in efficiency.

The overall efficiency of a pump (rip) can be expressed by the ratio of pump fluid-horsepower output, fhp, to brake-horsepower input by the pump drive, bhp:

rip = fhp/bhp (6-9)

The pump fluid ho r sepower - - the  actual usable output delivered by the pumpmis  the product of delivered propellant weight flow [Wp (lb/s)] times the actual head AH(ft) developed by the pump, divided by a conversion factor:

fhp = Wp AH/550 (6-10)

The brake horsepower represents the mechanical horsepower delivered to the pump by the drive. It is consumed in the pump as fluid horsepower and as the various losses:

bhp = fhp + (hp) h + (hp)df + (hp) m + (hp)l
(6-11)

where- bhp  = brake horsepower fhp = fluid horsepower

(hp)h = ho r sepower  required to overcome hydraulic losses

(hp)df = horsepower required to overcome disk friction losses

(hp)m = ho r sepower  required to overcome mechanical losses

(hp)l = ho r sepower  required to overcome leakage loss

The efficiency of a pump is related to the vol ume flow rate Q and the pump specific speed Ns. There is a definite trend toward increased efficiency with higher pump capacities primarily because the resulting larger size of the pump permits operation with smaller relative clearances, reducing leakage losses, and surfaces that are hydrodynamical ly smoother, reducing the skin-friction losses. The low specific-speed pumps have less efficiency because they typically have disk-friction and leakage losses that are relatively higher. This can be seen from Fig.
6-23, which shows the efficiency as a function of both the specific speed and the volumetric flowrate. (All rocket-engine pumps do not fall exactly on these curves, but they show the correct trends.) The overall efficiency of rocket-engine propellant pumps of high developed head and rotating speed ranges from 60
to 85%. This is up to 10% lower than that of high per formance  industrial pumps.  For a typical centrifugal pump, Fig. 6-24 shows the correlation between pump flowrate and the following three parameters: developed head, efficiency, and required brake horsepower.

Turbine overall  performance and operating efficiency. The turbine generates the power needed to rotate the pump at the desired speed. The turbine derives its energy from the working fluid. The power generated equals the product of the flow times the available energy of the working fluid times the turbine efficiency. To achieve the desired power, the turbine designer will typically try to achieve the maximum efficiency within the constraints imposed, and the tradeoff between flow and available energy will depend on the particular cycle.

The available energy content of the turbine working fluid is defined as the enthalpy drop per pound of working fluid in the turbine:

AH t = H o - H e (6-12)

where- AHt --- available energy content of the working fluid, Btu/lb Ho = enthalpy per unit weight of the working fluid at turbine inlet, Btu/lb He = enthalpy per unit weight of the working fluid at exhaust  pressure (assuming isentropic expansion), Btu/lb

Using Eq. (1-10) and (1-13), Eq. (6-12) can be rewritten for an ideal gas as follows:

t / ]po where Cp = working-fluid specific heat at constant pressure, Btu/lb-F

To = working-fluid total temperature at turbine inlet, "R

Te -- working-fluid static temperature at turbine exhaust, "R

Po = working-fluid total pressure at turbine inlet, psia

Pe -- working-fluid static pressure at turbine exhaust, psia

~, = working-fluid specific heat ratio

The ratio of turbine-inlet and exhaust pressures pl/P2 can be expressed as the turbine pressure ratio Rt, which is a frequently used parameter in turbine design. Substituting this into Eq. (6-13) yields [ AHt = Cpro 1 -- \Rt,] J (6-14)

It can be seen that the available energy in the tur bine working fluid is a function of gas properties, inlet temperature, and the turbine pressure ratio.

Most of the turbine working fluids for rocket-engine application are fuel-rich product gases generated by bipropellant combustion. Typical working-fluid properties are listed in Table 6-4. Precaution: these working fluids do not behave exactly as perfect gases;
real fluid properties must be used to assess accurately a turbine's performance.

Figure 6-25 shows the relationship between turbine-inlet temperature and available working-fluid energy for a turbine pressure ratio of 20 for the two propellant combinations, LO2/RP-1 and LO2/LH2. Turbine-inlet temperatures are limited by the high temperature properties of the turbine materials. State-of-the art uncooled metallic designs have a practical design limit of about 1600"F. Above certain levels, the gain from a higher turbine-inlet temperature will be offset by the turbine efficiency losses (see "blade losses" in following paragraphs)
resulting from higher gas-jet speed (spouting velocity Co), which is proportional to the turbine-inlet temperature.

Figure 6-26 shows the relationship between turbine pressure ratio and available energy of the working fluid for a turbine-inlet temperature of
1200"F, again for the propellant combinations LO2/RP-1 and LO2/LH2. Although a large amount of energy may be available in a working fluid, it may be difficult to convert it efficiently into turbine shaft horsepower because of the severe weight limitations on rocket-engine turbopumps. Thus the available pressure ratio of a turbine often cannot be fully used.

The overall efficiency of a turbine Tit is defined as the ratio of turbine shaft horsepower thp to enthalpy drop rate, or the available energy-delivered rate of the working fluid:

550thp tit = 778xJctAHt (6-15)

Again, for an ideal gas, this can be expressed using Eq. (6-14) to show the relationship to fluid properties, as follows:

The losses are due to flow turbulence, fluid friction, fluid turning, and loss of heat to and through the turbine nozzle-blocks.

 B l a d e  losses .  These are caused by residual velocity of the gas as it leaves the rotor blades, the obliquity of the nozzle (i.e., the nozzle angle in Fig.
6-10 cannot be made zero), flow turbulence, and fluid friction. Losses due to residual gas velocity can be reduced by optimizing the turbine blade-to-gas velocity ratio U/Co, where U is the pitch speed of the rotor blades and Co is the ideal spouting velocity of the gas based on available energy and isentropic expansion. These conditions can be analyzed quantitatively by means of turbine-gas-flow velocity diagrams (to be discussed in section 6.6). Flow turbulence can be reduced through improved blade shape and through full turbine nozzle admission.

 L e a k a g e  o r  c l e a r a n c e  losses .  The clearance required between rotor-blade tips and casing permits some gas to leak past the blades without doing work, thus causing energy losses. The gas leakage from stage to stage in a multistage pressure-compounded turbine due to required clearance between shaft and sealing diaphragm results in similar losses.

 D i s k - f r i c t i o n  losses. Fluid friction occurs at the interface of gas and rotor-disk surfaces. Also, centrifugal action of the rotor disk causes some of the gas to flow radially to the casing and to be dragged along the face of the casing by the rotor blades, causing friction.

 M e c h a n i c a l  l o s se s .  These result from the mechanical friction in bearings and rotating seals.

Efficiency. The design of turbines for rocket turbopumps tends toward the simpler and lighter impulse-types, with most of the expansion occurring in the stationary elements. Figure 6-27 shows the typical efficiency curves of various impulse-type turbines. The design problem becomes one of balancing efficiency (optimum velocity ratio U/Co), weight (number of stages or rows), and structural considerations. A higher performance can be achieved by employing a working fluid with high

However, the blade speed is often limited by the required pump rpm, by the practical size of the rotor wheel, and the strength of materials. The. optimum velocity ratio (or optimum value of blade speed for a given gas-spouting velocity) is reduced by the use of velocity or pressure-compounded arrangements (shown schematically in Fig. 6-9 and 6 11). However, these designs increase weight and complexity.

In general, a direct-drive configuration (Fig. 6-15)
with an rpm lower than ideal produces a low value of U/Co, and a velocity-compounded turbine will be used because of its low overall weight and simplicity. Where a reduction gear is provided between pumps and turbine, a higher value of U/Co is possible and a more efficient pressure-compounded turbine can be used.

Since the turbine pressure ratio has only a small effect upon available energy content of the working fluid (Fig. 6-26), the power level of a turbine will usually be regulated by controlling the inlet pressure
(po) and in turn the flow rate (wt) of the turbine.



174 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

System cal ibra t ion  and  off-design char actertstics. Before the 1970s, rocket-engine systems operated at a single set of conditions, specifically, at rated thrust and mixture ratio. Each of the components  in turn were designed for optimum functioning at that rated thrust level. However, most of the engine components ,  notably pumps and turbines, were also required to operate satisfactorily within a certain range different from the design point. Such a need may be caused by system and c o m p o n e n t  cal ibrat ion characterist ics,  system operational deviations, system start and shutdown transients, and special system requirements, such as throttling.

Owing to tolerance requirements on engine and c o m p o n e n t  per formance ,  and to correct  for hydrodynamic variations within the components, it is sometimes necessary to calibrate a turbopump before its integration into an engine system. The performance of each pump will be determined experimentally. By modifying the pump geometry
(impeller trimming) and varying the discharge hydraulic resistances, the desired operating charac teristics required by the engine system can be achieved. For turbopumps with both pumps driven by a single turbine (as shown in Fig. 6-15), the calibration procedure begins with the experimental determination of the shaft speed at which one of the pumps (usually the oxidizer pump) develops the required head and flow. Simultaneously, the suction characteristics of this pump are determined at this speed. The other pump is then operated at the same speed and the discharge adjusted for the required flow. Based on the pressure readings, the diameter of the pump impeller will then be trimmed on a lathe until the desired head is produced at rated speed and flow. The pump suction characteristics at these conditions are also determined. Figure 6-28 shows the trimming effects of a typical pump. The trim ming procedure requires that the pump impellers to be made sufficiently large initially, since addition of material is not feasible. The calibrated pumps are then combined with a turbine.

The turbine calibration requires either an ad justment of the flow to achieve the required power or, if the flow is limited, an adjustment of the fluid operating condition (e.g., temperature). This pro cedure considers the influence of turbine variations resulting from fabrication variations. The turbopump is then matched with the remaining engine system in complete-engine system calibrations. Adjustments in engine mixture ratio can be made by installing an orifice in the discharge of one of the pumps. Orifice installation considerations and type of propellant often make it desirable to ensure that the orificing is always installed for the same propellant; in LOX/RP systems, usually the fuel. For this reason, the pump for that system is trimmed for a slightly excess head. Adjustments in engine thrust level are made by varying the turbopump speed.

More recent engine designs (e.g., the SSME)
require operation over a throttling range that forces the pumps to operate at off-design conditions. This requires an active control system that adjusts the respective pump parameters to achieve the desired operation. For the SSME, the oxidizer and fuel pumps are on separate shafts so that a seoarate adjustment of their respective speeds is achievable as well as an adjustment of flowrate.

One of the most significant pump off-design characteristics, the pump stall point, usually occurs in the low-flow region. The pump operation tends to be erratic at this point, resulting in the abrupt loss of developed head and the danger of overspeeding. Stall is the result of a boundary-layer separation at some point in the pump system. The first blade row to stall could be either a rotor or stator, depending on the particular design. The magnitude of the head falloff due to stall will also vary from pump to pump;
but in general, axial-flow pumps tend to have a much more severe stall characteristic than centrifugal pumps, as illustrated in Fig. 6-29. Because of this, applications requiring a wide operat ing range typically use centrifugal designs rather than axial. It is the responsibility of the pump designer, of course, to establish the required operating range for a pump and to produce a design that will be satisfactory over this range.

During the start and shutdown transients of an engine system, propellant flow and pressure char acteristics will be determined by the engine's system design characteristics. Figure 6-30 shows the propellant flows and chamber-pressure buildup his tory for a typical gas-generator engine start transient
(note temporary oxidizer-flow drop as a result of LOX-dome priming). A rocket tu rbopump must attain full power  in substantially less time than conventional turbomachinery. Frequently, full-power operation must be attained in less than 1 s--dictated by the need for propellant-consumption economy in flight and for avoiding the possibility of flow instability in the thrust chamber and other compo

This, together with other transient require ments, such as throttling, must be satisfied by the off design characteristics of a turbopump. Throttling substantially influences selection of pump type. Basically, the problem involves coupling the pump characteristics with those of the rest of the engine system under off-design operating conditions.

Relative-velocity concepts. Before dis cussing the details of pump and turbine design, the concept of relative-velocity vectors must be under stood because of the rotating blade rows. The rotating components  have a velocity U in the circumferential direction that is independent of flow. The velocity of the fluid relative to the rotor (W)

For ex ample, Fig. 6-31 shows the absolute velocity at the inlet of a pump blade row as c with components cm in the through-flow direction and cu in the tangential direction (cu could be zero or even negative). The velocity W1 is the inlet velocity relative to the blade that establishes the blade loading and performance. Similarly at the discharge, W2 is the relative vector exper ienced  by the pump  blade, but c2 is the resulting absolute velocity. Note that, in the absolute plane, the velocity was increased (c2>cl),  i.e., the pump added energy to the flow. In the relative plane, however, the velocity is diffused (decreases, W2<W1). The boundary layers on the pump blade are based on the relative vectors, not the absolute vectors. These vector relationships will be used in further discussions of pump design.

6.3 INDUCER DESIGN

The rocket-engine industry has been the primary contributor to the development  of inducer tech nology (Ref. 6-2). The inducer's axial-flow rotors can operate with a low inlet pressure without significant decrease in the discharge head. The inducer typi cally operates with some amount of cavitation, which may occur in the tip vortex flow or along the blade element  itself as the inlet pressure is decreased. However, the technology has progressed to the point that long life can be achieved even with cavitation occurring. Inducers used in the initial rocket engines produced very low headrise with head coefficients that were typically less than 0.1; the inducer was operated in series, and generally was close-coupled to the main impeller. As the technology improved, inducer  designs became more  complex ,  with increased head coefficients (up to 0.25 with a single row of blades and in some cases over 0.5 with a double row of blades, as shown in Fig. 6-8). These larger head coefficients made it possible to use the inducer as a boost pump where the inducer is the only rotor on the shaft (e.g., LPOTP--see Fig. 6-7, and LPFTP pumps  on the SSME). In some commercial applications, inducer pumps have been used where the only rotor is an inducer.

The need for an inducer is based on the re quired minimum NPSH, or alternatively, the max imum suction specific speed. Generally, an inducer will be required if the suction specific speed exceeds

10,000. For rocket-engine pumps that require suction specific speeds from 20,000 to 50,000 or higher, inducers are almost invariably used; and in fact, the suction performance will dictate the allowable speed of many turbopumps. This will in turn determine the size of the pump, number of stages, and general configuration to a large degree. Figure 6-32 shows the impact on speed and diameter of a given design as inlet pressure is reduced assuming constant head coefficient and number of stages for the pump.

Experience has shown that the suction of a pump strongly depends on its inlet flow coefficient. Figure
6-33 shows this effect for an inducer operating in a fluid with low vapor pressure (e.g., water). In cryogenics, the capability is even further improved because of the localized decrease in temperature and vapor pressure in the vicinity of the cavitation on the blade surface (an effect known as "thermo dynamic suppression head"). This can be seen in Fig. 6-34, which shows actual data acquired from numerous pumps used in fluids with high vapor pressure, such as liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Some of the hydrogen pumps fall on the (NPSH/cm2/2g)
curve of 1.0, reaching corrected suction-specific speed values of up to 140,000. Some of the LOX pumps fall on the curve of 2.0.

Capabilities as expressed in Fig. 6-33 are based on some defined percentage of head loss in the pump. Common values used in industry are either 2
or 3% head falloff from the "noncavitating" head. If

Fig. 6-33 Suction-specific-speed capability with no thermodynamic suppression head benefit. the inducer is producing a small percentage of the overall head, as in a centrifugal or multi-stage axial pump, the total head lost by the inducer can be 15 to
30% when the pump head drops by 2%. For boost pumps consisting of only the inducer, the head loss in the pump is equivalent to that for the inducer it self. The NPSH at which the defined head falloff occurs is called, as mentioned earlier, the critical NPSH (NPSHc).

To design an inducer, the margin relative to the critical NPSH must be established based on the re quired use, life, and conservatism desired in the pump. For example, a pump designed for a non manrated expendable  launch vehicle that only experiences the minimum NPSH at end of flight might be desired to operate at NPSHc at the end of the flight. For a reusable vehicle requiring long life and consistent operation at a given NPSH, however, a margin would be required, where the margin M is expressed as a percentage using the relationship:

M = 100 (min. operating NPSH- NPSHc)/ NPSHc

(6-17)

Typical values used in design would be M = 100% for long life at a given NPSH = 20% for short life at the minimum condition but ability to handle reasonable part-to-part and flight-to-flight variations.

To initiate an inducer design after defining the required margin, an experienced-based capability curve, as in Fig. 6-33 or 6-34, must be used. As was indicated above, fluids with a substantial vapor pressure (like liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen)
offer additional benefits. It has been shown that hy drogen inducers can operate at a critical NPSH equal to one inlet-velocity head, and liquid-oxygen induc ers can operate with two inlet-velociW heads. That is, NPSHc = cm2/2g liquid hydrogen = 2cm2/2g liquid oxygen. However, this is only true when the inlet velocity head is small compared to the vapor head.

As a general limit, the thermodynamic suppression head TSH of a fluid cannot exceed 50% of the vapor head.

To illustrate a typical design process, assume that an engine is being designed to deliver 25,000 gpm of liquid oxygen with a minimum required total inlet pressure of 25 psia and a vapor pressure of 15 psia. Assume the des ign only opera tes  at m i n i m u m conditions for a short time, nominally operating at much higher inlet pressure.

Let M = 20%
NPSH minimum = (25-15) 144/70 -20.6 ft NPSH c = 20.6/1.2 = 17.1 ft

Assume the inlet hub-diameter of the inducer is 30%
of the tip diameter. For some high-speed inducers in a dense fluid like liquid oxygen, a larger value of
40% may be  requ i red  for s t ructural  reasons . Calculate cm:

cm = (2g NPSHc/A)0.5 (A = 1,2,3 dependent  on fluid; for LO2 use 2)

cm = (2g [17.1]/2 )0.5 = 23.5 fps



178 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Verify that inlet velocity head is less than 0.5 times vapor head to get full TSH benefit:

cm2/2g = 8.55 ft
50% of vapor head = 0.5 (15)(144)/70 = 15.4 ft

Calculate the tip diameter of the inducer inlet:

c m

A
= Q/A
-- (g/4)Dt2 (1 -[Dh/Dt]2)/144 ft2
= 4.96 (10-3)Dt 2

where Dt is in units of inches and Q must be in units of cfs. Substituting from the above values yields.

D t = 21.86in. D h = 6.56in

At this point, a flow coefficient must be assumed. For opt imum suction performance,  values in the range of 0.06 to 0.10 are used; the lowest values are more sensitive to fabrication tolerances and more limited in flow range. For long-life values higher than 0.15 are used. Inducers with values up to 0.3
have been tested. Assume:

= 0.I Ut = cm/~ = 235 ft/s

This is a reasonable value for structural limits. The pump speed is then N - 2464 rpm. Check suction specific speed:

Nss = N (Q)0.5/(NPSHc).75 = 46,300

Based on Fig. 6-34, this is an achievable suction specific speed in liquid oxygen.

The head generated by the inducer usually will be selected to enable the following impeller to operate with essentially no cavitation. For example, the impeller might be designed for a maximum suction specific speed of 5000 to provide some margin in the impeller design. Thus, the head produced by the inducer must be sufficient to increase the NPSH from its inlet value to the value needed for the impeller. Using the numbers from the above example and letting NPSHI equal the NPSH at the impeller inlet y ie ldsm

Nss = 5000 -- 2464 (25,000)0.5/NPSHI 0.75 NPSHI
= 332.8 ft

Therefore, the required inducer head rise will be AH
= 332.8 20.6 = 312.2 ft.

With the tip speed of the inducer previously calculated, the inducer head coefficient will be ~  312.2/([23512/32.2) = 0.182. This is an achievable head coefficient with a single row of blades. How ever, to achieve this it will be necessary to increase the diameter of the hub at the discharge.

The hub diameter of inducers for current rocket engine pumps will usually be larger at the discharge than at the inlet. This reduces the amount  of diffusion being done along the hub s treamline--a critical factor in preventing discharge recirculation and thereby providing a relatively uniform head and velocity into the impeller eye or into a downstream stator. The design objective is to achieve the head in the inducer, provide a relatively uniform dis charge condition, avoid any recirculation at the inducer discharge, and avoid any cavitation on the leading edge of the downstream blades. The exact diameter selected will be based on analyses of the flow in both the inducer and impeller (or stator)
using either a quasi-3D or full-3D approach.

Approximate selections can be based on ve locity-vector diagrams at the inlet and exit of each blade row using simple radial-equilibrium equations at the discharge to account for variations from tip to hub. The resulting profile would appear as shown for the inducer in Fig. 6-7.

The number of blades for the inducer is kept small at the leading edge to minimize blockage and thus improve suction performance. Previous designs have used 3 to 7 inlet blades, but 3 to 4 is preferable for suction performance. Some inducers with three blades experience larger radial loads under partial cavitating conditions. In view of that, four blades are more frequently used in current designs. Larger flow coefficients (~0 > 0.2) allow a larger number of blades. To increase head rise, partial-length blades are sometimes introduced downstream of the blade overlap region at the point where all cavitation is collapsed. Thus, the inducer exit would have twice the number  of blades as the inlet. This is recommended if head coefficients must exceed 0.25.

The inlet-velocity angle at the tip is established by the flow coefficient, assuming no inlet prewhirl. That is, letting ai equal  inlet flow angle from tangential at the tip:

0ti = tan -1 cm/Ut = tan -1 (6-18)

With ~ being generally less than 0.15 for rocket engine inducers, ai  is generally less than 8.5 deg. Inducers are designed to operate with an incidence angle i that varies from approximately 3 deg up to a maximum of approximately one-half  of the inlet blade angle. The effect of incidence angle on the design is discussed in detail in Ref. 6-2 through 6-5. The exact incidence chosen at the design point will depend on the required flow range of the part and the life characteristics. The inlet blade angle [31t equals the inlet flow angle plus the incidence angle, as shown in Fig. 6-31. The length of the blade is much longer in the tangential than in the axial direction because of the small blade angle. At the inlet, the blade angle varies from tip to hub according to the relat ionship r t a n  } = c o n s t a n t  ( 6 - 1 9 )

The discharge blade angle is set to achieve the desired head. This head can be expressed as  AH = 11 A(Ucu)/g (6-20)



T U R B O P U M P  PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 179

where r I is the inducer efficiency and the velocities cu are as illustrated in Fig. 6-31. The discharge axial velocity is calculated to satisfy continuity and radial equilibrium. The resulting velocities enable calcu lation of the discharge vector diagram. This establishes fluid velocities, but because of the blade loading the flow typically exits the inducer at an angle less than the blade angle. This difference
(deviation angle) must be accounted for based on experience or an accurate Navier-Stokes solution of the inducer flow-field.

The distribution of blade angle between the inlet and discharge is designed to provide for both suction performance and efficiency. To improve suction performance, the inlet region to the point of overlap of the blades is typically designed with less camber than would be obtained, for example, from a circular-arc-blade profile. Final profiles are usually established based on quasi-3D or 3D analyses of the flow field.

The structural integrity of the blades must be evaluated over the full range of operation, including any transients. The blade loading due to partially cavitating conditions can be very different from the loads noncavitating. Typically, as inlet pressure decreases, more of the blade loading shifts to the back of the blading, owing to cavitation on the suction surface, which provides a minimum pressure limit.

6 . 4  DESIGN OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS

Because of its specific needs, the rocket industry has developed its own pump design approaches, which may differ from those for conventional applications. In addition, designers may employ their individual methods of analysis and calculation. However, the broad underlying principles are quite similar. The range of speeds, proportions, design coefficients, and other  mechanical  details for rocket-engine pumps has been well established by earlier designs as well as through experiments (Ref. 6-6).

G e n e r a l  D e s i g n  P r o c e d u r e s

As a rule, rated pump head capacity (H-Q) re quirements  and expected available NPSH at the pump inlets will be established by engine system design criteria. The first step then is to choose a suitable suction specific speed Nss and the type of inducer that will yield the highest pump speed N at design conditions [Eq. (6-7)]. The pump specific speed  (N s) or type of impeller  can now be established from the chosen pump speed and re quired head-capacity characteristics. Owing to its relatively light weight and simplicity of construction, a single-stage centrifugal pump may be given first consideration.

With suction specific speed and specific speed of the proposed pump design established, the designer can now look for a suitable "design model" among comparable  existing pumps that approximate the desired performance (i.e., a pump with the same specific speed and suction specific speed).  If a suitable model is available, the new pump design can be scaled from the previous design. Letting "f' equal the ratio of the scaled dimension, that is- f = D2/D1 (6-21)

makes the following correlations valid for pumps with like specific speed, based on the pump affinity laws [Eq. (6-3a) and (6-3b)]:

Q2 = Qtf3(Nz/N~) (6-22a)

= impeller diameter of the new pump, ft

To achieve the same performance, all dimensions in the pump must be scaled by the scaling factor, including parameters such as surface finish and seal clearances. When scaling up, this is easily done, and usually the larger pump will achieve even better performance because of lower relative surface finish and clearance values. When scaling down, however, this works against the performance.

If a suitable model is not available for the design of a new pump, the designer can use "design factors"
es tabl ished exper imenta l ly  by other successful designs. These may permit establishing relations between rated pump-developed head and flow rate and such parameters as veloci W ratios. However, best results are obtained through experimental testing of the proposed design itself. The test results can then be used for design revisions and refinements.

Fig. 6-35 Typical shrouded centrifugal impeller with backward-curved blades.

Operating Principles of  the Cent r i fuga l Impel ler

In its simplest form, the impeller of a centrifugal pump can be regarded as a wheel  with blades, ro tating in an enclosure, with the fluid being admitted axially and ejected at the per iphery,  as shown schematically in Fig. 6-35. The tangential velocity component  of the fluid increases as it moves out radially be tween the blades. The centrifugal force acting on the fluid therefore increases as the fluid moves out radially. For opt imum performance, most impellers in high-speed centrifugal rocket-engine pumps have shrouded, backward-curved blades. The impeller width is tapered toward the periphery to keep the cross-sectional area of the radial flow path nearly constant, as shown in Fig. 6-35.

Velocity diagrams may be constructed to analyze the fluid flow vector correlations at various points of an impeller. Assume the following ideal conditions:
no losses, such as fluid-friction losses, impeller passages completely filled with actively flowing fluid at all times, flow axisymmetrical (velocities at similar points on the flow lines are uniform), and fluid leaves the impeller passages tangential to the vane surfaces (complete  guidance of the fluid at the outlet).

The ideal inlet- and outlet-flow velocity diagrams of the impeller described in Fig. 6-35 are shown in Fig. 6-36. With corresponding fluid velocities u, v, and c (as identified above), 0t is the angle between c and u, and ~ is the angle enclosed by a tangent to the impeller vane and a line in the direction of vane motion. The latter is equal to the angle be tween v and u (extended). Based on these velocity diagrams, the following correlations have been established:

AHip = [u22 - Ul 2 + v12 - v22]/(2g) Eq. (6-23)

AHi = [u22 - u12 + v12 - v22 + c22 - c12]/(2g)

For centrifugal pumps of the noninducer type (now rarely used in rocket pumps), proper selection of the impeller inlet vane-angle ]]1 or the provision of guide vanes at the inlet minimizes the absolute tangential component  of fluid flow at the inlet CUl, which for best efficiency should be zero. This is defined as no prerotation, where 0~ 1 -- 90 deg. Thus, Eq. (6-24) becomes  AH i = u 2 cu2/g (6-27)



TURBOPUMP PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 181

This discussion has assumed ideal conditions. For most rocket applications, centrifugal pumps are designed with an inducer upstream of and in series with the impeller. The flow conditions at the impeller inlet thus are affected by the inducer's discharge flow pattern. In addition, two types of flow usually take place simultaneously in the flow channels, namely, the main flow through the pas sages and local circulatory (vortex) flows. It is preferable to keep these secondary flows small, but they are always strong enough to significantly affect the overall flow field. As a consequence, the fluid is caused to leave the impeller at an angle [32 ' less than the impeller discharge vane angle ~2 and to increase the absolute angle cz2 to a2'. This and the hydraulic losses in the impeller correspondingly change the relative flow velocities v 1 and v 2 to Vl' and v2', the absolute flow velocities Cl and c2 to c1' and c2', and the absolute tangential components CUl and cu2 to cul '  and cu2'. Since the radial-flow areas A 1 and A2, and the impeller flow rate Qimp remain constant, the absolute radial  or meridional components cml and cm2 also remain unchanged. The inlet- and out let-flow velocity diagrams in Fig. 6-36 may now be redrawn as represented by the dotted lines. The correlat ion establ ished in Eq. (6-24) may be rewritten as follows:

AHim p = (u2cu2,- u I CUl')/g (6-28)

where- AHimp = actual developed head of impeller, ft

CUl = tangential component  of the design absolute-inlet-flow velocity, ft/s cu2' = tangential component  of the design absolute-outlet-flow velocity, ft/s

The ratio of the design flow velocity cu2' to the ideal flow velocity cu2 can be expressed as ev = cu2'/cu2 (6-29)

where ev = impeller vane coefficient; typical design values range from 0.65 to 0.75. Referring to Fig. 6-36, Eq. (6-26) may be rewritten:

cu2'= u2-  cm2/(tan [32) (6-30)

By definition, the required impeller-developed head can be determined f rom AHimp = AH + H e - AHind (6-31)

where Qimp = Q + Qe (6-32)

where- Qimp = required impeller flow rate at the rated design point, gpm Q = rated delivered-pump-flow rate, gpm

Qe = impeller leakage losses, gpm. Most of these occur at the clearance between impeller wearing rings and casing. Typical design values of Qe vary from 1 to 5% of Qimp. (Oxidizer pumps may be higher.)

Centrifugal-Impeller Design Elements

After general pump-design parameters, such as developed head AH, capacity Q, suction specific speed Nss, rotating speed N, and specific speed Ns have been established, a centrifugal (radial) pump impeller may be designed in two basic steps. The first will be selection of velocities and vane angles that are needed to obtain the desired characteristics with optimum efficiency. Usually this can be done with the help of available design or experimental data such as pump-head coefficient ~, impeller vane coefficient ev, and leakage loss-rate Qe. The second step, design layout of the impeller for the selected angles and areas, requires considerable experience and skill of the designer to work out the best performing configuration based on the given design inputs. This can be done graphically or  numerically, but either approach will require a flow analysis to confirm the design using at least a quasi-3D analysis. Codes capable of solving the 3D full Navier-Stokes equations in the complex flow field of a centrifugal impeller are being used  but have not yet demonstrated that they are qualified to optimize the design. Three-dimensional Euler codes are used with success in analyzing the flow fields at least near the maximum efficiency point.

The following are considered minimum basic design elements required for proper  layout of a radial-flow impeller:

1) The inlet flow coefficient ~ = cml/Ue, where U e is the velocity of the impeller at the eye. A typical design guideline imposes constant merid ional velocity from the inducer discharge to the impeller eye. Thus the inlet flow coefficient is primarily set by the inducer discharge, the hub and tip diameters of the impeller inlet being set to achieve an area equal to, or larger than, that at the inducer discharge. The eye diameter of the impeller frequently is increased relative to the inducer discharge tip-diameter to account for added flow through the wear rings of the impeller. These leakage flows can be relatively large in small pumps, and if

AH = rated-design pump-developed head, ft the pumped fluid is cryogenic the density of the AHind = required inducer head at the rated leakage fluid may be lower, thereby increasing the design point, ft volumetric flowrate. These leakage flows will be mixing with the core flow from the inducer, but

The flow coefficient for the impellers usually will be higher than for the inducer inlet, but values from 0.08 to 0.4 have been used. Setting this parameter will set the inlet diameters.

The impeller hub diameter must of course be large enough to fit over the shaft. The required shaft diameter can be estimated using the relationships:

Ss = 16 T/(rtds 3) (6-33)
St = 32 M/Otds 3) (6-34)

w h e r e ~
ds = impeller shaft diameter, in. T -- shaft torque, in.-lb

M = shaft bending moment, in.-lb. Ss = shear stress due to torque, lb/in.2
St = tensile stress due to bending moment, lb/in.2

2) The discharge flow coefficient ~2 = cm2/U2, where U 2 is the velocity of the impeller at the tip. The discharge meridional velocity cm2 should be approximately 1.0 to 1.5 times the inlet meridional velocity cmi. The flow coefficient will then be set by the impeller tip speed selected to meet the head requirements. Values of discharge flow coefficient from 0.05 to 0.3 have been used.

3) Ratio of impeller eye to tip diameters. This ratio should be maintained below 0.70 to avoid efficiency penalties. Larger values have been used, up to 0.8, but a mixed-flow impeller will usually give a better efficiency for these higher values.

4) The impeller peripheral  velocity at the discharge U2. The value of U2 can be calculated by Eq. (6-2) for a given pump-developed head H and a selected overall pump head coefficient V. The maximum design value of U2 depends on the material strength, which determines the maximum developed head that can be obtained from a single stage impeller. Typical maximum values of U2 range from 600 to 2000 ft/s, as shown in Table 6-5. With U2
and N known, the impeller discharge diameter d2
can be calculated readily.

5) The inlet blade angle 131. Because the value of ~1 will be affected by the inlet flow conditions, [31
should ordinarily be made equal or close to the inlet flow angle ~1' so that the incidence angle is a small positive value. The incidence may be varied from hub to tip because of the velocity gradients;
therefore, it is usually best to select the tip incidence because the tip has the highest relative velocity, which makes it more prone to cavitation. Also, if the pump must operate over a wide flow range, the incidence at the "design point" may be adjusted to enable noncavitating and nonstalled performance over the full required range. Typical design values for ~1 range from 2 to 8 deg, with the smaller values at the tip.

6) The discharge blade angle ~2. In the special case of radial-bladed impeller designs, [32 equals 90
deg. Backward-curved impellers, with [32 less than 90
deg, are usually more efficient and more stable, and these are used on almost all modern designs. Usually the selection of ~2 is the first step in determining the other impeller design-constants, since most of them depend on [32. Pump efficiency and head-ca pacity characteristics are also important consid erations for the selection. For a given U2, head and capacity increase with ]32. Figure 6-37 shows the rela

tionship between ~2, the discharge flow coefficient

~2, and the number of impeller blades. Typical de sign values for ~2 range from 17 to 40 deg for back ward swept blades.

7) Number of blades. Figure 6-37 has shown the relationship of the number of blades to other key design parameters. The figure shows the minimum number of blades needed to achieve a given head coefficient for an impeller with a ratio of eye-to-tip diameter (8) of 0.65. The number of blades derived from the figure is the number  required for the discharge of the impeller. Fewer blades will usually be required at the inlet to avoid cavitation. It is not uncommon, therefore, for a rocket-engine impeller to have partial blades (also known as splitters) which begin partway through the impeller and continue to the exit. Impellers have been successfully used with more than one set of partials; e.g., the SSME HPFTP
(Fig. 6-5) has 6 blades at the inlet and 24 blades at the exit. The impeller has a set of long partials and then a set of short partials. The placement of the partial leading edge in the blade passage is critical; it must be chosen by an adequate flow analysis to avoid leading-edge cavitation and to achieve a relatively uniform flow-split. The discharge blade characteristics will usually be identical for full and partial blades, the objective being to achieve a uniform velocity field in each exit passage. As an alternative to Fig. 6-37, the designer can use other published slip factors to calculate the blade angle required to achieve a given fluid angle. (The slip factor is a ratio of the discharge fluid's tangential velocity compared to the ideal velocity obtained if the flow followed the blade.)

8) The width of the impeller at the exit can be calculated by the following correlation:

~2 = Qimp/(3.12 gd2 cm2 g2) (6-35)

where- [32 = impeller width at the discharge, in. e2 = cont rac t ion  factor at the discharge. Typical design values range from 0.85 to
0.95. This nondimensional  factor ac counts for the blockage due to the blades and the boundary layers. Smaller pumps may require a smaller value.

Qimp = impeller flowrate at the rated design point, gpm

After the blade angles and other dimensions at inlet and discharge have been established, no set rule guides designing the backward-curved blades. The blade profile must be smooth and avoid steep gradients along the suction surface to avoid bound ary-layer separation. The blade shape is typically generated using smooth profiles, and then analyzed using an appropriate code (quasi-3D or better). The blade will then be adjusted to attain a smooth variation of velocity from inlet to discharge, with no local areas of large diffusion on the suction surface and no potential for cavitation along the blade. It is also desirable to minimize the length of the passage to reduce friction losses, but this must be balanced by the requirement to control the diffusion rate. The flow-passage shape should be as close to square as possible. It is also desirable to have the blade at the exit be at a relatively constant angular location from tip to hub shroud to avoid corner angles that can increase boundary-layer blockage. The blades should be as thin as the material strength and manu facturing processes will permit. They may be of constant thickness, but the leading-edge profile will be contoured  to avoid cavitation and reduce incidence losses. This leading-edge contour may require an appropriate ellipse rather than just a simple circular arc.

184 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Mixed-flow-type vanes that extend into the impeller entrance or eye (shown in Fig. 6-38a) are frequently used in rocket-engine centrifugal pumps. This is done to match the impeller-inlet flow path with the inducer-discharge flow pattern, to provide more efficient turning of the flow, and to provide structural support to the shrouds.

The mixed-flow-type impeller (shown in Fig. 6 38b) is used when the impeller needs a large ratio of eye-to-tip diameter. The velocity correlations and design constants of a mixed-f low impeller  are essentially the same as those of a radial-flow impeller. Mean effective impeller diameters are used in the calculations for head rise, flow velocities, etc.

Design of  Casings

The pump casing must have the structural integrity to carry loads from the pump to the engine-support system. Internally it must provide hydrodynamic passages efficiently to collect the high-velocity fluid exiting the impeller and convert this kinetic energy into pressure while minimizing the imposed radial load on the rotating members. It does not contribute to the generation of head, but a poor design can significantly reduce both head and efficiency. The construction of a typical centrifugal-pump casing is shown in Fig. 6-4. The front section of the casing, which provides the pump inlet and houses the inducer, is called the suction nozzle. The rear section of the casing, which collects the fluid from the im peller and converts the velocity head into pressure before the discharge, is called the volute. There may be an additional set of stationary vanes called a vaned diffuser between the impeller and the volute.

Since the flow path in a suction nozzle is short and the flow velocities are relatively low, the head loss in a suction nozzle due to friction is very small. The contour of the suction nozzle is designed to suit the inducer configuration. A tapered suction nozzle
(as shown in Fig. 6-16) has the area gradually decreasing toward the impeller eye, which steadies the flow and ensures uniform feed to the impeller. However,  many pumps cannot  efficiently use a tapered inducer because of the need for axial motion of the shaft to balance axial loads. In liquid oxygen pumps, frequently a liner made of a material such as Kel-F or silver is inserted be tween the inducer and suction-nozzle wall. This eliminates the possibility of metal-to-metal rubbing in the presence of narrow inducer-tip clearances. Rubbing in liquid oxygen pumps may cause dangerous explosions.

Pump inlets are not always configured to permit an axial inlet flow. In such cases the inlet must be designed to provide a relatively uniform inlet velocity field at the inducer inlet and to minimize the losses which reduce the available NPSH for the inducer. These design requirements can be met by using either vaned elbows, a volute scroll with vanes
(Fig. 6-5), or a manifold inlet that enters radially on one  side and divides the flow into two circumferential flow paths wrapped around the pump and feeding radially inward. Vanes are used in all of these designs to preserve a uniform velocity field at the inducer inlet.

Two basic types of discharge casing are used in rocket centrifugal pumps: the plain volute and the vaned-diffuser volute (see Fig. 6-39). In the first, the impel ler  discharges into a volute channel  of gradually increasing area. Here, the major part of the conversion of velocity to pressure takes place in the conical pump-discharge nozzle at the volute exit. In the latter, the impeller first discharges into a diffuser provided with vanes. A major port ion of the diffusion takes place in the channels between the diffusing vanes before the fluid reaches the volute channel. The main advantage of the plain volute is its simplicity. However, the vaned diffuser plus volute can usually provide a higher degree of point efficiency, particularly in high-head pumps. Head losses in pump  volutes are relat ively high. Approximately 70-90% of the flow kinetic energy is converted into pressure head in either volute type.

The hydraulic characteristics of a plain volute are determined by several design parameters, such as volute throat area av and flow areas a0, included angle 0s between volute side walls (Fig. 6-40), volute tongue angle 0tv, radius rt at which the volute tongue starts, and volute width b 3. Pump specific speed Ns somewhat  influences the design values. All of the

pump flow Q passes through the volute throat section av, but only part of it passes through any other section; the amount depending on the location away from the volute tongue.

As its primary design requirement,  the volute must provide a uniform pressure boundary at the impeller outer diameter at least at the design point. That is, the single d ischarge  in t roduces  an asymmetry to the pump that at off-design conditions produces  a pressure  gradient  at the impeller discharge, causing a radial load acting on the ro tating member  that must be carried by the bearings. At the design point of the volute, these radial loads are theoret ical ly  zero. This design condi t ion approximates a linear area distribution with cir cumferential angle, but is not exactly linear for two reasons. First, the friction forces acting on the volute walls affect the velocity/pressure field. Second, the decrease in velocity because of the change in radius
(conservat ion of angular m o m e n t u m )  must  be included.

To avoid impact shocks and separation losses at the volute tongue, the volute angle 0~v is designed to correspond to the direction of the absolute velocity vector at the impeller discharge. The radius rt at which the tongue starts should be 5-10% larger than the outside radius of the impeller to minimize dynamic loads on the impeller blades and the volute tongue.

The dimension b 3 at the bottom of a trapezoidal volute cross-section will be chosen to minimize losses from friction between impeller discharge flow and volute side-walls. The width b 3 is generally set between 1.0 and 1.25 times the impeller width at the discharge for pumps without a vaned diffuser; low specific-speed pumps could be even higher. The shape of the volute shown in Fig. 6-40 results in a symmetric design that will generate a double vortex, as shown in Fig. 6-41. An asymmetric cross section is preferred because it produces a single vortex that is more stable and improves overall efficiency. For designs with diameter limits, a folded volute can be used (also shown in Fig. 6-41). For the symmetrical volute, the maximum included angle 0s between the volute sidewalls should be about 60 deg. For higher specific-speed pumps or for higher impeller-dis charge flow angles, the value of 0s should be made smaller.

The pressure at the outer diameter of the im peller cannot always be kept uniform, especially under off-design operating conditions. This results in a radial thrust on the impeller shaft. To eliminate or reduce the radial thrust, both double-tongue and double-discharge volute designs have been used (Fig.
6-42). Here, the flow is divided into equal streams by two (or more) tongues set 180 deg apart. Although the volute pressure unbalances may be the same as in a single-volute casing, the resultant of all radial forces may be reduced to a reasonably low value because of symmetry.

Vaned diffusers have also been used extensively, particularly in higher-pressure pumps. The diffuser vanes serve as structural members to maintain the integrity of the volute under hoop stresses induced

Hydrodynamically, the use of the diffuser improves efficiency, at least near the design point ,and tends to reduce radial loads at the off-design conditions by significantly reducing the velocity in the volute and maintaining a more nearly constant velocity angle. Figure 6-43 shows a vane-is land diffuser that is desirable when the diffuser is in the s t ructural- load path. Diffuser vanes with aerodynamically shaped discharges as well as inlets are used for peak efficiencies where the vanes do not



186 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES have to carry large loads. The radial clearance between impeller and diffuser-inlet vane tips must be sufficiently large to avoid large dynamic stresses on the impeller blades and diffuser vanes because of dynamic interaction. The preferred ratio of diffuser inlet to impeller-discharge diameter is in the range of 1.07 to 1.10. However, for peak efficiencies and to reduce size and weight, smaller values are sometimes used, e.g., 1.05, particularly in low-density fluids such as liquid hydrogen. The width of the diffuser at its inlet should be similar to or up to 10% smaller than the width of the impeller's discharge flow.

The design of the vane shapes requires careful flow analysis to achieve efficiency and avoid inlet stall or cavitation. Typically, the design-point in cidence angle of the inlet will be kept small unless the desired operating flow range allows the design be biased in one direction to minimize stall over the whole range. At the low-flow condition it is not uncommon for the vaned diffuser inlet to be the first location to experience stall, although the head loss due to the stall may be relatively small (e.g., less than
5% of the overall head).

The number of diffuser vanes (z) should be kept to the minimum, consistent with good performance, and to avoid resonances should have no common factor with the number of impeller vanes. If possible, the cross section of the passages in the diffuser should be made nearly square (i.e., b 3 = h3). The shape of the passage below the throat should be diverging, with an angle between 10 and 12 deg. The flow leaving the diffuser should have velocity kept slightly higher than the velocity in the pump discharge line.

Multistage centrifugal pumps require crossover channels to direct the flow from the discharge of one stage to inlet of the next. Crossovers can be external using a volute collector at the discharge of one stage and a duct routed to the inlet manifold of the next. However, this leads to a much larger, heavier, more-costly design as compared with an internal-crossover system.

Internal-crossover design involves conversion of kinetic energy into pressure, turning the flow 180 deg to the inlet of the next stage, and distributing the flow uniformly at the inlet to the next impeller. Crossover requirements can best be met in separate steps. The continuous-passage crossover (as found in the SSME HPFTP, Fig. 6-5) is a good example. The majority of the pressure recovery is achieved in the upcomer, which is a passage diffuser with design features similar to a vaned diffuser's. Flow will be turned in a constant-area turnaround duct, designed to minimize secondary flows and their associated losses. The remaining pressure recovery takes place in the downcomer, which is also designed to provide the desired inlet velocity vector at the next stage inlet. The flow is discharged from the downcomer in an annular channel long enough to provide some mixing of the wakes and boundary-layer growth developed in the crossover passage. The flow then enters the eye of the next impeller.

Balancing the Axial Thrust of  Centrifugal Pumps

The pressures generated in these pumps and the areas of the rotating members are sufficiently large that the designer must hydrodynamically balance the axial loads acting on the rotating components. This balance must be sufficient to maintain low axial loads on the bearings throughout operat ion--for transient operation as well as steady state. If the pump is required to throttle, the balance must be adequate throughout the throttle range to protect the bearings from overload. Various techniques are available to achieve a balance design. For the tu rbopump in Fig. 6-16, the two impellers are mounted back-to-back with balance ribs on the back of the impeller that can be adjusted to achieve a reasonable balance at a fixed operating condition. The discharge pressures attained in this pump and the single-point operation yielded an acceptable de sign, requiring no self-adjusting control system.

The pressure forces acting on the surface of the rotating members  are strongly affected by the magnitude of the rotational velocity of the fluid in the cavity between the rotating and stationary walls. p_ P v ~ / 9 l - - -  Pv

Frequently, the velocity in the cavity can be approx imated by a forced-vortex type of flow (velocity linearly dependent  on radius). With such an approx imation, pressure at any point along the rotating surface is given b y  Pr = Pl - P k2 (U12 -Ur2)/2g (6-36)

where Pl, Pr are the pressures at the tip and at any other radius, respectively; U1 and Ur are the corre sponding rotational speeds of the wheel; p is the fluid specific weight, and g is the gravitational constant; k is the ratio of the average fluid tangential velocity c divided by the rotational velocity of the wheel U at any radius. Note that if k is large, the pressure gradient is large, and the pressure force is less as the diameter decreases. Placing balance ribs on the rotating wheel increases the fluid velocity;
that produces a higher k value and reduces the force. As another option, placing antivortex ribs on the stationary surface tends to decrease the k value and increase the fluid force. For two smooth surfaces with no appreciable through-flow, the average value of k will be 0.5.

Rather than ribs, seals can be used to achieve a balance,  as illustrated in Fig. 6-44. A balance chamber  is provided at the back shroud of the impeller, between back wearing-ring diameter dbr and shaft-seal diameter ds. Proper selection of the projected chamber area and of the admitted fluid pressure balances axial loads. The pressure level pc in a balance chamber can be controlled by careful adjustment of the clearances and leakages of the back wearing ring and the shaft seals. The required Pc can be determined by integrating the pressure forces over the respective areas to achieve the necessary balance.

The high-pressure pumps on the SSME operate over  a throttle range and involve such large pressures that more sophisticated balancing tech niques were required. To illustrate the techniques available to the designer, consider the SSME HPFTP of Fig. 6-5. The pump and turbine being on the same shaft, both must be included in the axial-thrust model. The turbine thrust was designed to oppose the pump thrust to help achieve an overall balance. The labyrinth seals on the back side of the impellers

Finally, to provide some self-adjusting ability, a balance piston (Fig. 6-45) was incorporated on the back side of the third-stage impeller. The complete rotating assembly is free to move over a limited range, in the axial direction, to respond to any unbalanced loads. As the assembly moves it opens one of the two orifices of the balance piston and closes the other. This adjusts the pressure on the back side of the impeller that changes until arriving at a balanced force. The total available travel is typi cally small (e.g., 0.020 in.), and the balance piston is designed to operate at the middle of the force range at the operating point with the highest speed.

6.5 DESIGN OF AXIAL-FLOW PUMPS

Except when used as inducers, axial-flow pumps for rocket engines have essentially been limited to liquid-hydrogen systems in a multistage configura tion where the required flow range of operation was limited (Ref. 6-7). Multistage axial-flow hydrogen pumps are used in applications going beyond the capability of a single-stage centrifugal pump, since the multistage construction is comparatively simple
(Fig. 6-3). As shown in Fig. 6-6, the fluid in an axial flow pump flows from one stage to the next with a minimum of connecting passages.

The head coefficient of a typical single-stage centrifugal hydrogen pump falls in the range of 0.45 0.65. For an axial pump,  however ,  the head coefficient for a single stage will usually be limited to the range of 0.2-0.4. Thus, more stages will be hv

188 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES required to get the same head for the axial pump, but the staging is much easier to achieve. Typically, the axial pump will have a lower flow-limit because of the minimum practical height hv of the vanes (Fig.
6-46). For heights below 0.5 in., the tip clearance required for efficient performance becomes critical, causing manufacturing problems or increased risk of operation. Each axial stage should preferably have a flow coefficient in the range of 0.25 or higher and the stage hub/tip diameter ratio should generally be less than 0.9 for efficient operation. Using these guidelines, the designer can parametrically evaluate the relative design features, such as diameter and blade height, to meet requirements. Also, a reduction in rotor diameter below certain values will not be practical because of the high rpm required for proper blade speed.

Axial pumps typically are used where specific speeds per stage are in the range of 3000 to 6000. An area of overlap allows either a multistage axial or centrifugal pump. The better solution will be dictated by other considerations, such as space envelope, mounting and ducting arrangement, required flow range, etc. Probably the major limit of axial pumps is their tendency to stall at low-flow conditions. This stall involves separation of the boundary layers on the blades, and it significantly reduces both pump head and efficiency. This can be seen in Fig. 6-47, which presents actual data of a multistage axial flow pump. The pump operation must be maintained at some comfortable margin (e.g., 10%) of flow above the stall condition.

Basic Assumptions for Axial-Flow Pumps

During operation of an axial-flow pump, it is as sumed that the meridional or axial component  cm of the absolute flow velocity remains constant throughout all stages of the impeller rotor and the stator. This approximation assumes that the ther modynamic conditions do not change sufficiently to require adjusting the density of the fluid in the stages. If the density changes are significant, they should be accounted for at least in the interstage planes. (There is seldom enough density change to require analyzing the pump flow as a compressible fluid in a given stage. However, the pump designer must be aware of the potential for cavitation and design to avoid it.) To satisfy the flow-continuity equation, the cross-sectional areas of the various flow passages at right angles to cm must also remain constant. This assumption is reasonable, except for the effects of frictional drag at the casing walls and the vanes. Again, where significant boundary layers develop it may be desirable to increase the blade heights in successive stages to maintain an approx imately constant cm in the core flow.

Operation of  the ImpeRer Rotor

As its main function, the impeller rotor of an axial f low pump---by the action of airfoil-shaped rotor vanes (Fig. 6-48 and 6-49--imparts kinetic energy to the fluid by increasing the tangential component  of the absolute  flow velocity. It is convenient  to describe the vanes on several developed cylindrical sections. Three sections are of particular interest: at the impeller tip diameter dt, at the impeller hub dh, and at its mean effective diameter dm (inches). The mean effective diameter is defined by- dm2 = 0.5( dr2 + dh2) = 0.5 dt2(1 + rd2) (6-37)

where  r d = impeller hub ratio, or dh/dt .  For sim plicity, vane characteristics and flow conditions are d iscussed here only with respect  to the mean effective diameter dm. The vanes are equally spaced at a circumferential distance Pr:

Pr = ~:dm/zr (6-38)

w h e r e m P  r = pitch or rotor vane spacing at the mean effective diameter dm, in., and Zr = number of rotor vanes. The ratio of the rotor-vane chord length Cr to the pitch Pr is called rotor-vane solidity Sr:

S r -  Cr/Pr (6-39)

where  Sr = rotor-vane solidity at the mean effective diameter  dm. The solidity generally increases from ro tor - t ip  d iamete r  dt to hub diameter  d h for structural reasons.

The profile of the vane can be represented by the vane mean line (Fig. 6-49), which determines most  of the important hydraulic properties of the vane. The thickness of the vane varies along the mean line for better performance and for structural strength. To effectively impart the driving action to the fluid, the angle of the vane mean line, or rotor vane angle, is gradually increased from ~2 to ~3.

The difference be tween the two, ~ 3 -  ~2, gives a measure of the vane curvature (camber) along any par t icular  vane  section.  Mean-l ine geomet r i e s deve loped  for axial compressors  and airfoils are generally applicable to pumps,  but the potential for leading-edge cavitation must  be evalua ted  and avoided for a good design. In axial-flow p u m p designs,  all vane  mean  lines can often be approximated by a circular arc. For this case, the following correlations can be established:

~c = 0.5(~2 + ~3) (6-40)

Some parameters  in the equations above require further definition. The parameter  e represents the ratio of effective flow area to the geometric area---a parameter introduced to express the blockage caused by the buildup of boundary layers, particularly at the hub and tip-shroud. Thus, this parameter will usually be smaller at stages further downstream. Estimation of this parameter is usually based on an empirical database, a l though solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with an adequate  turbulence model are also acceptable. The parameter Qe is used to account for any leakage introduced at the various points in the flow path. Calculation of leakage flows is general ly done  independen t ly  and successively iterated with the pump design. The incidence angle is chosen by the designer considering the efficiency, cavitation potential, and the required flow-range. The deviation angle "ii" must be calculated in terms of the real fluid effects or estimated using some empiri cally based estimating technique. One such tech nique that has been widely used, the "Carter's Rule"
or "modified Carter's Rule", can be found in various references (e.g., Ref. 6-2 and 6-7). As can be seen from Eq. (6-47), calculation of the deviation angle to design a blade to get the correct discharge velocity is absolutely critical to obtaining the correct head.

F u n c t i o n  o f  t h e  S t a t o r

The stator of an axial-flow pump converts a major portion of the tangential component  of the absolute flow velocity leaving the rotor into static pressure by
"straightening" the flow after it leaves the rotor. The stator-vane curvature is designed so that the fluid enters the vanes with minimum loss and leaves the stator with a reduced tangential component  of the absolute flow velocity.  The cross-sectional areas of the stator flow passages normal to the axial direction equals those of the rotor, thus maintaining the axial componen t  of the absolute  flow velocity. The dimensions dt and d h of the stator, (Fig. 6-48) can be treated as equal to the tip and hub diameters of the rotor. The solidity of the stator vanes generally increases from hub diameter (d h) to tip diameter
(d t) because the vanes are supported structurally at the tip. The axial length (Ls) of the stator vane at the mean effective diameter is usually made equal to that of the rotor (Lr), but it is governed by the solidity and the required number of vanes.

Regarding Fig. 6-49, the velocity diagrams for the stator inlet and outlet are constructed with the assumption that the absolute flow velocities and angles at stator inlets and outlets equal the corre sponding ones at the rotor outlets and inlets. This facilitates the design of multistage axial-flow pumps using uniform rotor and stator stages.

To deflect the fluid effectively, the inlet-vane angles (0c 3) of the stator should be greater, by a few degrees, than the inlet absolute-flow angles (0c3'); i.e., an angle of attack "i" should be allowed. Also, an angle "ii" should be al lowed between outlet-vane angle (~4) and outlet absolute-flow angle (0c4') for the deviation angle. The following correlations can be es tabl ished for the vane and flow velocity diagrams of the stator (Fig. 6-49):

192 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Design of  Impeller Rotors and Stators 2) With N established, selection of impeller rotor and stator of a given specific speed per stage

A number of design factors directly affect the per- (Ns)l, combined with a determination of the number formance characteristics of an axial-flow pump.  of pump stages, can proceed with the aid of the Evaluation of test information, on the basis of following correlations:
specific speed per stage (Ns)l, shows the following definitive correlations:

I m p e l l e r - h u b  r a t i o  r d .  The ratio of impeller hub diameter dh to tip diameter dt (Fig. 6-48) has a direct bearing on the specific speed per stage (Ns) 1. Higher-specific-speed pumps have higher relative flows and therefore smaller hub ratios that result in greater free-flow area; but they also have lower head
(H/Q)  characteristics. However, a higher hub ratio tends to yield a higher head coefficient per stage
(W)I. Typical values of rd in rocket-engine hydrogen pumps range from 0.75 to 0.86. Typical design values for (Ns)l and (W)I range from 3000 to 5000 and from
0.25 to 0.40, respectively. A key factor that sets the head coefficient, the diffusion factor, will be dis cussed more fully below.

Vane  s o l i d i t i e s  S~ Ss. The vane solidities or chord-spacing ratios of the rotor and s t a to r -  important design parameters - -a re  selected on the basis of previous experience. A higher pump specific speed is linked with lower solidity primarily because the required head is smaller and so gives the higher specific speed. Typical design values for vane solidities for the rotor and stator at the mean effective diameter (dm) range from 1 to 1.34 and 1.5
to 1.8, respectively. Lower values are generally more efficient when  the diffusion factor and head generated are lower.

N u m b e r  o f  v a n e s  Zr, Z s .  A lower pump specific speed usually results in a larger number of vanes. Design values of z r range from 14 to 20. Design values of Zs are typically higher, up to a factor of approximately 2. To minimize the potential for dynamic interaction, the number  of stator vanes should have no common factor with the number of rotor blades.

Vane  c u r v a t u r e  a n d  s e t t i n g .  Experiments indicate that the head developed by the rotor is essentially determined by vane curvature, i.e., ]3 3 - ]3 2.

Changes in vane settings (i.e., outlet-vane angle ~3
and inlet-vane angle 132) by the same amount will not affect head rise and efficiency significantly.

The design procedure for the impeller rotors and stators of a multi-stage axial-flow pump is es sentially the same as that for a single-stage cen trifugal pump, except for the determination of the number  of pump stages. Design parameters and coefficients established experimentally using prior successful designs should be utilized to the fullest. Special development  tests will still be required to verify the characteristics of a new design. The design procedure should include the following steps:

1) To meet a given set of engine system re quirements such as rated design pump-developed head H, flow rate Q, and rated pump (NPSH)c, the pump rotating speed N is determined first through selection of a suitable inducer of a given suction specific speed (Nss)in d.

(Ns)l = N (Q)0.5/(AH)10.75

AtH = AHind- Hee + n(AH) 1
(6-64)

(6-65)

where-  (Ns)l = specific speed per axial-flow-pump stage N = rated design pump rotating speed, rpm Q = rated design pump flow rate, gpm

(AH)I = rated design pump-developed  head per axial-flow pump stage, ft

AH = rated design pump-overall-developed head, ft

AtHind = inducer rated head rise, ft Hee = hydraulic-head loss at the inducer stator, ft n = number of axial-flow pump stages

3) For the specific speed per stage (Ns)l thus obtained, various design factors and coefficients such as impeller hub ratio rd, vane solidities Sr and Ss, number of vanes Zr, and Zs, head coefficient per stage (~)1, etc., will be selected based on past designs with comparable (Ns) 1 values.

4) The required impeller  rotor and stator diameters, velocity diagrams, and vane profiles can now be derived from Eq. (6-37) through (6-63).

Impeller  rotor and stator vanes are usually machined from forgings of a luminum alloys or nickel-base alloys such as K-Monel. In view of the relatively low head produced by an individual axial flow-impeller stage, reduction of skin-friction and flow-turbulence losses prove more important than with centrifugal pumps. High efficiency demands a high degree of vane streamlining and polishing.

The axial distance da between impeller rotor vanes and stator vanes (Fig. 6-49) has some bearing on performance. Typical design values of d a range from 0.02 to 0.05 dr, where dt equals the impeller-tip diameter.  This spacing is also expressed as a function of the chord of the upstream blade. In general, the spacing should not be less than 10% of this chord to avoid large dynamic stresses because of the interaction of the rotor-stator blades. As improved CFD codes are being developed,  the dynamic stresses can be calculated to give guidance to the design. Design values for tip clearance c for both the rotor and stator (Fig. 6-46) should be no more than approximately 2% of the blade or vane height. Smaller values can be used depending on the manufacturing tolerances and the dynamic behavior of the pump that controls the rotor's radial motion.

The vane thickness along the mean line will mainly be determined by structural considerations because experiments indicate that there is very little effect on performance from variation of vane thickness as long as the leading and trailing edges



T U R B O P U M P  PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 193

are kept at a small radius and the thickness is deve loped  along the meanl ine  in an efficient manner. The problems with calculating stresses for

~ ump rotor vanes are similar to those with turbine lades. The methods given in section 6.6 for turbines can also be appl ied  here. Vanes exper ience centrifugal, bending (due to lift and drag loading), and vibrational stresses.

Diffusion and Retardation Factors

In designing the axial pump, it is desirable to in crease the head per stage to reduce the total number of stages. However, the head per stage is limited by the ability of the blading to turn the flow without inducing a separation that causes pump stall, an undesirable operating condition. Usually the peak efficiency of the design will be maximum as the head per stage is increased, but design margins must be maintained to avoid stall. To assess the stall po tential and the losses in an axial stage, a "parameter diffusion" factor has been developed; it has been shown to be a reliable indicator. Using the vector diagrams of Fig. 6-49, the diffusion factor for the rotor can be expressed as follows:

DFr = 1.0-(v3'/v2') + (cu3'-cu2')/(2Srv2') (6-66)

Similarly, for the stator:

D F s -  1.0-(c4'/c3' ) + (cu4'-cu3')/(2Ssc3') (6-67)

Good efficiencies at reasonable stall margins have been achieved with the diffusion factors in the range of 0.45 to 0.55. Diffusion factors above this range have been successfully used, but require a more sophisticated analysis to assure that stall will be avoided. Designs have been achieved that push the stall up to a diffusion factor of 0.75; obviously, the higher the diffusion factor, the smaller will be the unstalled flow range.

Also used to estimate the stall condition has been a "retardation" factor. Using again the vectors of Fig. 6-49, the retardation factor for the rotor is given by (v3'/v2') and for the stator by (c4'/c3'). The designer should assume that stall will occur whenever the retardation factor reaches 0.5. SuccessfuU designs have been achieved with this factor as low as 0.63.

Design of  Casings for Axial Pumps

As shown in Fig. 6-6 and 6-50, the casing of an axial flow pump consists of a cylindrical section housing the inducer and impeller stages. It also includes a volute section with radial guide vanes situated behind the last rotor stage of the impeller. In addition to converting the tangential-flow-velocity component  into pressure, the volute section also serves to reduce the axial-velocity component  by gradually increasing the flow area toward the volute discharge.

The radial guide vanes of the volute section are designed so that the fluid enters them with minimum losses and leaves them in a radial plane, analogous to a centrifugal pump (Fig. 6-43). The number of radial guide vanes will be chosen to achieve the desired turning with a reasonable diffusion factor in the space provided. They should have no common factor with the number  of impeller rotor blades.

Vane angle (av) can be determined by constructing the flow velocity diagram for that section.

The design calculations for the volute are the same as for a centrifugal-pump volute. This includes the area distribution, cross-sectional shape, and the volute tongue angle.

Balancing the Axial Thrust of MultiStage Axial Pumps

Balancing of the combined axial thrust of a multi stage axial-flow pump is an important function because of the high pressures involved. Special balancing devices, such as automatic balance pis tons, are frequently used. Secured to the rotor as sembly, as shown in Fig. 6-50, the balance piston operates on the same principle as the balance piston of a centrifugal pump, consisting of a disk with small clearances and a pair of seal rubs located on either side of the disk. The balance piston has a forward movement (toward the inlet) of the rotor assembly. That reduces the clearance at the front-seal rub, simultaneously increasing clearances at the rear-seal rub. As a result, the pressure drops in the control chamber between front and rear seal rubs. This effect counteracts the forward hydraulic axial thrust of the rotor assembly. Similarly, a pressure increase in the control chambers counteracts a rearward movement
(reverse thrust) of the rotor assembly. The volume to the rear of the control chamber communicates with the low-pressure region of the pump inlet through cavities in the rotor.

With the smaller diameter  of the axial-flow pump, the available area for axial thrust control will usually be smaller, and thus requires higher pressures to achieve similar thrust ranges. The higher pressures also lead to higher leakage rates, which can penalize the pump efficiency. Thus, the final performance comparison of axial- vs. centrifugal pump design must include evaluation of the effects of the balance-piston design.

6.6 TURBINE DESIGN

Gas-generator-cycle rocket engine applications will favor impulse turbines for their simplicity, high power-to-weight ratio, and low axial thrust (Ref. 6-8). Figure 6-51 shows the general arrangement of a typical single-stage, two-rotor, velocity-compounded impulse turbine. Gas-generator-cycle turbines are characterized by relatively high pressure ratios (e.g., as high as 20 for a single stage) with supersonic velocities and low flowrates. Turbine flowrate is minimized in a gas-generator cycle to maximize engine specific impulse because the turbine flowrate bypasses the engine thrust chamber and produces a relatively low thrust. In some cases the turbine flow rate may be low enough to require partial-admission turbine nozzles (nozzles flowing around only part of their circumference) for higher performance.

Staged-combustion-cycle and series-expander cycle rocket engine applications will use low-reaction turbine stages to maximize turbine performance. Figure 6-52 shows the two-stage reaction turbine in the SSME HPFTP. Staged-combustion and expander cycle turbines are characterized by relatively low pressure ratios (e.g., less than 2 for two stages) with subsonic velocities and high flowrates. Turbine pressure ratio will be kept as low as possible to minimize the pump-discharge pressure required to achieve a given main-chamber pressure and pump power requirements. The low-reaction staging min imizes the maximum velocities in the stage, resulting in maximum efficiency. In high-chamber-pressure rocket engines, the low pressure ratios still result in high turbine-rotor pressure drops and high axial thrust of the turbine.

A turbine stage consists of an expanding sta tionary-vane row (nozzle) followed by a single row or multiple rows of rotating blades. Low expansions may occur in the rotating-blade rows and redirecting stator. A second expanding nozzle begins another stage. The total available energy is divided between the stages based on the desired power split.

General  Des ign  Procedure

An integrated turbine aerothermodynamic design will have overall requirements specified by a rocket engine balance calculation. The following steps (Fig.
653) are essential in the design of a rocket-engine turbine.

Selection o f  turbine  type. The first item of importance is the selection of the proper type. A single-stage rotor turbine (Fig. 6-10) will be used if the required turbine power is low, if the efficiency of the turbine has less effect on overall engine system performance, or if the pressure ratio is high and partial admission is required for high performance. When the available energy of the turbine working fluid, and therefore the gas spouting velocity Co is relatively low, a higher turbine velocity ratio U/Co may be achieved with a moderate turbine rotor blade speed U. As shown in Fig. 6-27, this suggests the use of a relatively simple single-stage, single rotor impulse turbine. This type was selected for the A-2 Stage oxidizer turbopump, at the same time taking advantage of its overall simplicity.

In most direct-drive turbopump configurations
(such as the A-1 Stage engine turbopump, Fig. 6-79), where the turbine rotating speed N and consequently turbine velocity ratio U/Co is lower than peak effi ciency, a single-stage, two-rotor, velocity-com pounded impulse turbine (Fig. 6-11 and 6-51) will be

196 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES selected for best results. Figure 6-27 indicates that the optimum efficiency of a velocity-compounded turbine can be achieved at a relatively low U/Co value.

The turbine can operate at a much higher ro tating speed (over 25,000 rpm) if a reduction gear train couples the pump and the turbine (Fig. 6-16). A higher value of U/Co can be achieved with rea sonable turbine rotor size. Then a higher-perfor mance, two-stage, two-rotor, pressure-compounded impulse turbine (Fig. 6-12) may be used.

Low-reaction staging (about 25% reaction) en ables low turbine pressure ratios to maximize effi ciency. Stage velocity ratio U/Co and efficiency can be increased and blade loading reduced by using two low-reaction stages. The power split between stages typically has been about equal.

Size  o f  t u rb ine .  After selecting the type of turbine, the designer determines the turbine-rotor size. Once the characteristics of the turbine working fluid, the turbine pressure ratio Rt, and the pump or turbine rotational speed N have been established, choosing a larger diameter for the turbine rotor tends to result in a higher velocity ratio U/Co, and thereby higher efficiency. However, the larger-diam eter turbine rotor also spells higher assembly weight, larger envelope, and higher working stresses. Final selection of the turbine-rotor size, and consequently the U/Co ratio, often entails a design compromise.

Determine  f l o w r a t e  and  p r e s s u r e  ratio. The required power output from the turbine must be equal to the net input to the propellant pumps, plus the mechanical losses in the bearings, seals, gears (if any), plus the net power required to drive any auxiliary drives. The required flowrate of the turbine working fluid can be calculated using Eq. (6-15) after the required power, available energy of the working fluid [Eq. (6-13)], and the overall turbine efficiency
(from Fig. 6-27 in the initial phases of design) have been estimated.

D i m e n s i o n s  o f  b l a d e  rows .  The initial di mensions of the stationary nozzles and of the ro tating blades can be calculated using a preliminary design pitch-line, gas-path program. The pitch-line analysis includes the selected staging, pressure distribution, and flow angles as well as representative losses due to friction and turning for each blade row, tip-clearance losses, partial-admission losses, rotor disk windage losses, and shaft- and interstage-seal leakage losses. The blade-row outlet flow area can be calculated using continuity for the outlet conditions. Stage power, efficiency, and reaction are calculated from the Euler equation, pressure distribution, and the losses. The interactive program allows the de signer to alter the various design parameters to achieve the optimum configuration within the design constraints. Computer graphics can display the resulting velocity-vector diagrams and blade-path geometry.

When blades are relatively short (height-to radius ratio less than 0.10) and when turbine effi ciency does not have a strong effect on engine cycle performance, constant-section blading can be used to lower cost and gain good performance. The radial-pressure variation is determined for constant flowdingle blading to determine axial thrust. Con stant-section blading usually employs relatively short, high-pressure-ratio supersonic blades.

For longer turbine blades (usually in subsonic turbine stages), a free-vortex radial distribution with twisted blades may be selected. Higher efficiency results from twisted blades due to reduced-incidence losses and more uniform flow from hub to tip. The ideal characteristics of a free-vortex design are constant axial velocity and rotor work from hub to tip. (Actual operation with efficiency gradients hub to tip cause variations in both velocity and work.)
The tangential absolute velocity out of each blade row from hub to tip can be calculated assuming that the product of the mean radius and the mean absolute tangential velocity is a constant. The rotor reaction at the mean diameter should be set to provide positive reaction at the hub. Inlet-blade angles are set to minimize incidence losses for the calculated flow-angles.

Efficiency can be increased to the maximum by using a forced-vortex radial work distribution. Increased work is performed in the lower-loss mid height of the blade and reduced work is done in the higher-loss hub and tip ends of the blade, resulting in higher stage efficiency. The reduced tip work also reduces the unshrouded-blade tip clearance loss. Figure 6-54 shows an example of a forced-vortex design rotor blade.

The detail design analysis that establishes the f lowpath ele vation and blade-profile dimensions may be done using an inviscid quasi-3D or full-3D analysis. The vane and blade surface distributions of velocity, Mach number, static pressure, and temperature are calculated from hub to tip for each blade row. The surface boundary layers are calculated assuming turbulent flow for the high-Reynolds-number com bustor products of the rocket engine. The blade shapes are modified until the surface distributions and boundary layers have acceptable diffusion levels and minimum loss and separation potential.

Blade-profile designs finalized, the viscous-flow solvers may be executed to verify the viscous effects. When the stage design is completed, the nozzle/
rotor interaction should be analyzed to establish the blade integrity under dynamic loading.

D e s i g n  o f  T u r b i n e  N o z z l e s

Turbine nozzle designs are classified as convergent divergent for high-pressure-ratio, supersonic, single stage turbines, convergent for subsonic and tran sonic stages, and partial admission when the rotor blade height would be too small for full admission.

Supersonic convergent-divergent nozzles. The nozzles of most gas-generator-cycle rocket engine turbines are basically similar to those of rocket thrust chambers. They are of the conven tional converging-diverging De Laval type with supersonic outlet velocities. In the main, the nozzles of an impulse-type turbine efficiently convert the major portion of available energy of the working fluid into kinetic energy or high gas-spout ing velocity. The gas fl0w processes in the thrust chamber nozzles are directly applicable to turbine nozzles. However, the gas flow in an actual nozzle deviates from ideal conditions because  of fluid viscosity, friction, boundary-layer effects, etc. In addition, the energy consumed by friction forces and flow turbulence will cause an increase in the static temperature of the gases flowing through a nozzle, above that of an isentropic process. (This effect is known as "reheat.") As a result of the above effects, the actual gas-spouting velocity at the turbine nozzle exit tends to be less than the ideal velocity calculated for isentropic expansion (from stagnation state at the nozzle inlet to the static pressure at the rotor-blade inlet). Furthermore, the effective flow area of a nozzle will usually be less than the actual area because of circulatory flow and boundary-layer effects. The following correlations have  been established for the design calculations of turbine nozzles:

Nozzle velocity coefficient kn:

kn = C1/Co (6-68)

The performance of a turbine nozzle, as ex pressed by its efficiency or velocity coefficient, will be affected by a number of design factors, such as;
exit velocity of the gas flow, properties of the turbine gases, angles and curvatures at nozzle inlet and exit, radial height and width at the throat, and pitch
(spacing) and number of nozzles. Design values for the efficiency and velocity coefficients of a given turbine nozzle may be determined experimentally or estimated from past designs. Design values of nozzle efficiency ~n range from 0.80 to 0.96. Design values of nozzle velocity coefficient kn vary from 0.89 to
0.98. The nozzle-throat area coefficient (ent) gen erally will increase with nozzle radial height, design values ranging from 0.95 to 0.99.

Rocket-turbine nozzles have rectangular cross section (Fig. 6-55). Nozzle vanes are closely spaced

Velocity Diagrams of a Typical Single-Stage Impulse Turbine

Fig. 6-55 Nozzles, rotor blades, and velocity diagrams of a typical single-stage impulse turbine. on a circular arc extending over a part of (partial admission) or all of (full admission) the circum ference. Most high-power turbines use full admission for better performance.

While the gases are passing through a nozzle and expanding, the direction of flow is changing from an approximately axial direction to one forming the angle 0tl (Fig. 6-55) with the plane of rotation, at the nozzle exit. Therefore, the turning angle is 904Xl deg. The angle (On) of the nozzle centerline at the exit usually represents a design compromise.  Theo retically, a smaller nozzle-exit-angle yields better efficiency, since the rotor blading work is larger and the absolute flow velocity at the rotor-blade exit is smaller. However, a smaller nozzle-exit-angle means a larger angle of flow deflection within the nozzle, which causes higher friction losses. Design values of e n range from 15 to 30 deg. The actual effective dis charge angle 0t 1 of the gas jet leaving the nozzle tends to be greater than 0n because of the unsym metrical nozzle shape at the exit.

A sufficiently large nozzle passage aspect ratio hnt/bnt is desirable for better nozzle efficiency. For a given nozzle height, an increase in aspect ratio can be secured by decreasing the nozzle pitch Pn However, a small pitch and consequently a large number of nozzles (Zn), with attendant increase in wall surface, tends to increase friction losses.

Determination of nozzle pitch also requires a design compromise.  The following correlations have been established for calculation of nozzle-flow areas:

Subson ic  c o n v e r g e n t  n o z z l e s .  S t a g e d  combustion and series expander-engine-cycle-drive turbines use subsonic convergent nozzles. The nozzle turns and accelerates the flow to the desired outlet Mach number from the inlet conditions. The nozzle passage converges with the minimum flow area at the outlet of the control channel (the throat). Additional expans ion  and turning may occur downstream of the throat. Nozzles with relatively short vanes can have constant section from hub to tip. The minimum passage width may be set by manufacturing constraints that would also affect the number of nozzle vanes. The height-to-throat open ing ratio has typically been between 3.5 to 8. The trailing-edge thickness typically varies between 5 to
15% of the throat opening. The fillet radius at the endwalls usually will be less than 30% of the throat opening. The number of subsonic nozzles used in rocket turbines has varied from 25 to 61. Nozzle efficiency values range to 0.97. Radial variations from hub to tip become significant for longer nozzles. The nozzle-outlet flow angle and area distributions are set to achieve the desired work distribution.

Laid out using computer  graphics and CFD analyses, nozzle profiles are designed to achieve the required acceleration and turning for the desired stage distributions. Numerous profiles are defined from hub to tip and analyzed as two-dimensional vanes, including the effects of streamtube thickness to determine the suction and pressure surface dis tributions of velocity, Mach number, static pressure, and static temperature. The vane loading, diffusion, and boundary layers are evaluated for acceptability, and the resulting 3D vane shape compared with the stage requirements.

Cylindrical endwalls ordinarily will be used with low-pressure-ratio turbine nozzles; contoured outer endwalls will be used on some first-stage nozzles. The preliminary subsonic-nozzle calculations for nozzle efficiency, outlet velocity, reheat, nozzle exit area, and tangential spacing use the same equations as the section for supersonic nozzles. The factors that affect supersonic nozzle performance, as dis cussed in the section above, apply to subsonic convergent-nozzle performance as well.

Part ia l -admiss ion nozzles.  Partial-admission nozzles are open for flow over only a fraction of the circumference of the turbine. The nozzles may be supersonic or subsonic, depending on the appli cation. The minimum number of nozzles is one, but generally two or more nozzles will be used with an equal sector 180 deg apart and opposite each other, for structural and dynamic symmetry. As the num ber of sectors increases, losses are incurred due to the increasing number of transitions from the active to inactive arc of admission, as shown in Fig. 6-56.

If the second-stage nozzle also has partial admission, the second nozzle can be set to capture the kinetic energy out of the first rotor at the design condition to maximize performance. An axial space upstream of the second nozzle will aid circum ferential flow out of the first rotor into the second nozzle for off-design operation, such as startup and shutdown transients.

D e s i g n  Of  T u r b i n e  Rotor  Blades

Turbine rotor blades used in rocket-engine turbines can be classified as supersonic impulse blades and subsonic impulse and reaction blades.

S u p e r s o n i c  impulse  ro tor -b lades .  Roto r blades in an impulse turbine (Fig. 6-51 and 6-55)
transform a maximum of the kinetic energy of the gases from the nozzles into useful work. Theoretically, there should be no change of gas static pressure, temperature, or enthalpy in the rotor blades. In actual operation, however, some gas expansion (i.e., reaction) usually occurs. Furthermore, the actual gas flow through the rotor blades deviates from ideal flow because of friction, eddy currents, boundary layers, and reheating.

The velocity-vector diagram shown in Fig. 6-55
describes graphically the flow conditions at the rotor blades of a single-stage, single-rotor turbine at the mean diameter dm. The gases enter the rotor blades with an absolute velocity C1 and at an angle C~l to the plane of rotation. The rotor blades have tangential or peripheral  speed U at the mean diameter. The relative velocities at the blade inlet and outlet differ (i.e., V1 > V2) due to friction losses. Ideally, the gas should leave the blades at very low absolute velocity C2 and in a direction close to axial for optimum energy conversion in the blades. The forces generated at the rotor blades are a function of the change of momentum of the flowing gases. The following correlations can be established for design

where-- tin = nozzle efficiency TIb = rotor-blade efficiency

Tim = machine efficiency, indicating the me chanical, leakage, and disk-friction losses

Equation (6-84) shows that the blade efficiency (TIb)
improves when 132 becomes much smaller than ]31. Reduction of 132 without decreasing the flow area at the blade exit can be achieved through an un symmetrical blade (Fig. 6-55), in which the radial blade height increases toward the exit. In actual designs, the amount  of decrease of [32, or the increase of radial height, will be limited by incipient flow separation and centrifugal stresses. Generally, the ~2 of an unsymmetrical blade will be approx imately [~1 - (5 to 15 deg). Equation (6-84) also indicates that TIb improves as a l  is reduced. Design values of kb vary from 0.80 to 0.90. Design values of rib range from 0.7 to 0.92. Referring to Fig. 6-55, the radial height at the rotor inlet hb will usually be slightly larger (5 to 10%)
than the nozzle radial height hn. This height, together with the blade peripheral speed U, will determine the centrifugal stress in the blades. The mean diameter of the rotor blades is defined as dm
- dt-  hb where dt is the rotor tip diameter. Pitch or blade spacing Pb is measured at the mean diameter dm. There is no critical relationship between blade pitch Pb and nozzle pitch Pn. There should be a sufficient number of blades in the rotor to direct the gas flow. The number of blades Zb to be employed is established by the blade aspect ratio hb/Cb and the solidity Cb/Pb, where Cb is the chord length of the rotor blades. The magnitude of the blade aspect



T U R B O P U M P  PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 201

ratio ranges from 1.3 to 2.5. Design values of blade solidity vary from 1.4 to 2. Best results will be determined by experiment.  The number  of rotor blades should have no common factor with the n u m b e r  of nozzles or of stator blades for the purpose of minimizing dynamic loading.

The blade face is concave, with radius rf. The back is convex, with a circular arc of small radius rr concentric with the face of the adjoining blade ahead. Two tangents to this arc to form the inlet; and outlet-blade angles 0bl and 0b2 complete the blade back. The leading and trailing edges may have a small thickness t b. Unsymmetr ica l - impulse-b lade profiles have also been defined using tangent parabola curves and combinations of straight lines, circular arcs, and parabolas.

The inlet-blade angle 0bl  should be slightly larger than the inlet relative-flow angle ]31. If 0bl < ~1
the gas stream will strike the backs of the blades at the inlet, exerting a retarding effect on the blades and causing losses. If 0bl > ~1 the stream will strike the concave faces of the blades and tend to increase the impulse. The outlet-blade angle 0b2 is usually made equal to the outlet relative-flow angle ([32).

The mass flow rate w t through the various nozzle and blade sections of a turbine is assumed constant. The required blade flow areas can be calculated by the following correlation (Note that the temperature values used in calculating the gas densities at various sections must be corrected for reheating effects from friction and turbulence):

Fig. 6-57 Typical rotor-blade construction.

Typical construction of turbine rotor blades and disks are shown in Fig. 6-52, 6-51, 6-55, and 6-57. Usually, blades are designed with a shroud to prevent leakage over the blade tips and to reduce turbulence and thereby improve efficiency. The shroud also limits blade vibration ampli tudes and increases rotor dynamic stability. Frequently the shroud forms an integral portion of the blade, the shroud sections fitting closely together when assembled. In other designs the shroud may form a continuous ring (Fig.
6-51) attached to the blades by tongues at the blade tip or by rivets. It can also be welded to the shrouds. The blades may be either welded to the disk or at tached to it using "fir-tree" or other dovetail shapes.

The main loads experienced by a rotor blade can be divided into three types:

 Tension a n d  b e n d i n g  due  to cen t r i f uga l forces .  The radial component  of the centrifugal forces acting on the blade body produces a cen trifugal tensile stress that reaches a maximum at the root section. As a remedy, blades are often hol lowed and tapered, with the thinner section at the tip, to lower centrifugal root-stresses. The centroids of various blade sections at different radii generally do not fall on a true radial line. Therefore, the centrifugal forces acting upon the offset centroids will produce  bending  stresses that also are at maximum at the root section.

 Bend ing  due  to gas loading. The tangential driving force and the axial thrust produced by the momentum change of the gases passing over the blades produce bending stresses. These forces are sometimes integrated and treated as acting at the midheight of the blade to determine the amount of bending induced. Otherwise, distributed pressures on the blade are defined from a 3D flow analysis.

 B e n d i n g  due  to vibration loads. Gas does not flow uniformly in the blade passages, as assumed in theory, but varies cyclically from minimum to maximum. The resultant loads represent a dynamic force on the blades, having a corresponding cyclic variation. The frequency of this force coming equal to the natural frequency of the blades may cause deflections that will induce bending stresses of considerable magni tude.  Therefore, the pr imary



202 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES forcing functions acting on the blades are designed so as not to correspond in frequency with any blade natural frequency.

Detail stress analyses for rotor blades can be rather complex.  A basic approach  counteracts a major port ion of the bending  moments  from gas loading with the bending moments  induced by the centrifugal forces at nominal operating speeds. This can be done  by careful blade design. Thus the centrifugal tensile stresses become a first consider ation in blade design, while other details such as cen t ro id  loca t ion  and  root  conf igura t ion  are established later to fulfill other design requirements. The following correlations have been established at the b lade-root  section where  stresses are most critical:

The bending stresses at the root can be calcu lated from the resultant bending moment  and the blade-root section properties. The vibration stresses can be estimated from past design data. A shroud added to a blade increases stresses at the root. The total stress at the root section adds these stresses to those caused by the centrifugal forces acting on the blades.

The stresses in a turbine-rotor disk are induced by the blades and the centrifugal forces acting on the disk material itself. In addition, torque causes shear stresses. As seen in Fig. 6-51, turbine disks are generally quite thick at the axis, but taper off to a thinner disk rim to which the blades are attached. In single-rotor applications it is possible to design a solid disk so that both radial and tangential stresses are uniform at all points, shear being neglected. In mult i rotor  applications, it is difficult to do this because of the greatly increased axial length and the resulting large gaps between rotor and stator disks.

Equation (6-94) may be used to estimate the ave rage tangential stress in any turbine disk, neglecting rotor-blade effects:

Turbine rotor blades and disks are made of high temperature alloys of three different base materials:
iron, nickel, and cobalt, with chromium forming one of the major alloying elements. High tensile strength and fatigue resistance at the operating temperature are important criterion for material selection. Other required properties include resistance to hydrogen embritt lement,  low creep rate, and oxidation and erosion resistance. Astroloy, Waspaloy, Mar M-246, A 286, and Inconel 718 are alloys frequently used. The rotor blades are fabricated either by precision casting or by precision forging. Rotor disks are best made of forgings for optimum strength. Integrally bladed disks ("blisks") are also used, but blade damping is more difficult to achieve, requiring more care to avoid fatigue damage.

process,  dep ic ted  in Fig. 6-53, sets the basic requirements of each blade row by a meanline-gas path analysis. The turbine-configuration optimiza tion follows various constraints. The rotor profile will be defined by a multistage meridional-flow-field analysis for the specified blade-path elevation. The results of the meridional  analysis establish the accelerat ion and turning characteristics of each rotor-profile section from hub to tip. Initial rotor profiles are generated on the computer  at several radial locations. The initial profile surface-velocity and static-pressure distributions can be checked using estimated streamtube thicknesses for adverse pressure gradients based on established guidelines. The rotor profiles are stacked from hub to tip, as can be seen in Fig. 6-54, including an estimate of the lean and tilt that may be required from the structural design to establish the 3D blade profile.

The 3D geometry is used in an inviscid multi stage quasi-3D or full-3D analysis program that determines the streamline and blade-to-blade flow field characteristics. The multistage capability being required, a complete  evaluation can be made of potential  changes  of individual b lade surfaces, including the effects on the other turbine-blade rows. The profile geometry  along a specified streamline will be de termined  so that detailed suction and pressure surface distributions can be calculated using a suitable flow-code. These distributions will be used in the boundary-layer code to determine the bound ary-layer characteristics that are assessed for losses and separat ion potential. Solid model ing of the defined 3D blade path that can be viewed from any orientation allows an early look at the turbine blad ing for mechanical,  structural, and thermal design analyses.

Design of Single-Stage, Two-Rotor, Velocity Compounded Impulse Turbines

Most impulse turbines will have only one or two rotors. It is assumed that a single-stage, two-rotor, veloci ty-compounded impulse turbine expands gases completely in the nozzle, and that no further static pressure change occurs during gas flow through the moving blades. As mentioned earlier, the two-rotor, ve loc i ty -compounded  arrangement  provides high efficiency at low velocity ratios. In this case, the gases ejected from the first rotor blades still possess considerable  kinetic energy. They are therefore redirected by a row of stationary blades into a second row of rotor blades that extract additional work from them. The gases usually leave the second rotor-blade row at a moderate  velocity and in a direction close to axial.

The velocity diagrams of a single-stage, two rotor, ve loc i ty -compounded  impulse turbine are based on a mean rotor diameter, as shown in Fig. 6 58, the peripheral speed of the rotor blades at the diameter being U. The gases leave the nozzles and enter the first rotor blades with an absolute velocity C1, at an angle 0c I with the plane of rotation; V 1 and V 2 are the relative flow velocities in ft/s at the inlet and outlet of the first rotor blades. The gases leave the first rotor blades and enter the stationary blades at an absolute flow velocity C2, and at an angle 0t 2. After passing over the stationary blades, the gases enter the second rotor blades at an absolute flow velocity C3, and at an angle 0c3; V 3 and V4 are the relative inlet and outlet flow velocities at the second rotor blades. Angles ~1, ~)2, ~)3, and ~4 represent the flow directions of V1, V2, V3, and V4.

As with single-rotor turbines, the exit velocity from any row of blades (rotary or stationary) will be less than the inlet velocity because of friction losses. It can be assumed that the blade velocity coefficient kb has the same value for any row of blades:

k b = V2/V 1 = C3/C 2 = V4/V 3 (6-96)

In a multirotor turbine, the total work transferred will be the sum from the individual rotors:

Ideally, TIb would be a maximum for the single-stage, two-rotor,  ve loc i ty-compounded impulse turbine velocity ratio.

U/C 1 = 0.25 cos O~ 1

i.e., when U = 0.25 Clt. The workload for the second rotor of a two-rotor, velocity-compounded turbine is designed at about one-fourth of the total work.

The design procedures for the gas-flow passages of the rotor and stationary blades of a single-stage, two-rotor turbine are exactly the same as those for a single-rotor turbine. However, velocities and angles of flow change with each row of blades. As a result, the radial height of symmetrical blades increases with each row, approximately as shown in Fig. 6-51. The effects of reheating (increase of gas specific volume) in the flow passages must be taken into account when calculating the gas densities at various sections. Equation (6-86) may be used to estimate the amount of reheat at each row of blades.

In the calculations for multi-row unsymmetrical blades, the radial heights at the exit side of each row are determined first by Eq. (6-90). The radial heights at the blade inlets are then made slightly larger, by approximately 8%, than those at the exit of the preceding row.

Design of Two-Stage, Two-Rotor Pressure Compounded Impulse Turbine

An operational schematic of a typical two-stage, two rotor, pressure-compounded impulse turbine and its velocity diagrams at the mean diameter are shown in Fig. 6-12 and 6-59. Each stage of a pressure-com pounded  impulse turbine may be regarded as a single-stage impulse turbine rotating in its own individual housing. Most of the design characteristics of a single-stage turbine are applicable to the individual stages. The gas-spouting velocities C1 and

C3, at flow angles 0t 1 and 0t3, of the first- and second stage nozzles are designed to be approximately the same; V1, V2, V 3, and V4 represent the relative flow velocities at inlets and outlets of the rotor blades; ~1,

[32, 133, and ~4 are the corresponding flow angles for V1, V2, V 3, and V4. The second-stage nozzles are designed to receive the gas flow discharged from the first-stage rotor blades at an absolute velocity C2, and to turn it efficiently to a desired angle cx 3. Simultaneously, by expansion to a lower pressure, the gases are accelerated to a desired velocity C 3. Flow at the outlet of the second rotor has an absolute velocity C4 and flow angle cz4; U is the rotor periph eral speed at the mean effective diameter dm.

The total work performed in the turbine sums the separate stages. These may be designed to divide the load equally (i.e., the velocity diagrams of each stage will be identical: C1 = C 3, C2 - C4, 0tl = 0t 3, 0t2 = 0t4, etc.). The friction losses occurring in the first stage are passed on in the gas stream as additional enthalpy and increase the available energy for the second stage. Also, the kinetic energy of the gases leaving the first stage will not be entirely lost, as with c~ 1

The carryover ratio rc--i.e., the ratio of the kinetic energy actually utilized as inlet energy by the second-stage nozzles to the total kinetic energy of the gases leaving the first stage- can vary from 0.4 to close to 1.0. The axial distance between the first-stage rotor and the second-stage nozzle, as well as the leakages through the sealing diaphragm between stages, should be minimized for optimum carryover.

Determining the correct enthalpy drop resulting in equal work for each stage may require a trial-and error approach,  in relation to the effects of reheating, or the proper  enthalpy drop may be estimated from previous designs and test data. With the velocity coefficients for nozzles and blades given by past or concurrent experiments, Eq. (6-72) and (6 86) can be used to estimate the amount of reheating.

Most equations established for the single-stage turbines may be used in the design calculations for two-stage turbines.  The fol lowing addit ional correlations are available for the design of choked second-stage nozzles:

Design of  Two-Stage, Two-Rotor, Low-Reaction Turbine

Two-stage, two-rotor, low-reaction turbines are used in staged-combustion-cycle or series-expander-cycle rocket engine systems to provide the highest turbine efficiency. In these engine systems, the turbine pressure ratio is low (1.5 to 2.0) and the stage velocity ratio is high (0.4 or higher). In high chamber-pressure oxygen/hydrogen engines like the SSME, using two stages increased blade height, gave higher efficiency, and divided the high power between two rotating blade rows, lowering blade stresses in comparison with a single-stage turbine

The design calculation and resulting vector diagrams of a two-stage, low-reaction turbine (see Fig.
6-13) are similar to those for the two-stage, pressure compounded impulse turbine (Fig. 6-12) discussed in the previous section (6.6.5), except for greater stage reaction (increased rotor-s tat ic-pressure drop fraction) and lesser nozzle and rotor turning. Two stage, low-reaction turbines usually optimize for nearly equal power split between the rotors, with the first stage producing the slightly higher power. The blading is usually twisted to minimize inlet incidence losses for the significant radial-flow-angle variations from hub to tip. Rotor-outlet absolute velocities are usually near axial (zero swirl). Reaction turbines have higher rotor axial thrust due to the higher static-pressure drop across the rotor.

Figure 6-60 shows the mean diameter velocity vector diagram for the SSME HPFTP turbine at full power level. Note the proportions of blade speed to nozzle-outlet velocity and relative velocity increase across the rotors compared with Fig. 6-59 for the pressure-compounded impulse turbine.

6.7 TURBOPUMP ROTORDYNAMICS AND MECHANICAL ELEMENTS

Rotordynamics

The rotor structure will resonate when excited at its natural frequency. With the pump propellants used, the amount of damping obtained in a rocket engine turbopump is typically too small to critically damp the system. Therefore, at the resonance, large vi bration amplitudes can be experienced and gener ally must be avoided. The rotating-assembly natural frequency will be dictated by the rotor mass a n d bending stiffness distribution coupled with the bear ing-support-structure stiffness, and will include the gyroscopic effect of the spinning disks. "Rotor synchronous motion" means rotation with the shaft spin speed and precessional  speed equal in direction and magnitude. The most common cause of forward synchronous motion is rotor unbalance. Rotor vibration amplitude is determined by the proximity of the natural frequency to the syn chronous excitation and the amount of damping present in the system. Figure 6-61 shows how these factors influence the behavior of a simple rotor.

Operation of turbomachinery at or near a nat ural frequency causes excessive response, increases wear, and reduces reliability. Synchronous motion coincident with the rotor natural frequency is de fined as operation at a critical speed. The dynamic response can be reduced by increasing the effective damping or designing the rotor to locate its natural frequencies far from the shaft-spin-speed excitation.

In dynamic analysis of the rotating assembly- an essential part of the turbopump design processm critical speeds, rotor-stability margins, bearing loads, shaft loads, and shaft deflections will be calculated to ensure that rotor-dynamic characteristics will be compatible with operating speed and transient response requirements when traversing critical speeds. Additional analyses are performed to inves tigate potential problem areas due to nonlinearities resulting in nonsynchronous shaft whirl or shaft loads and deflections due to steady-state hydro dynamic sideloads. Turbopump rotors are designed



206 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES so that the critical speeds are well separated from the operating range. The rotor bearing supports are designed to provide the stiffness required to separate the critical speeds from the operating range and minimize the dynamic bearing loads and shaft deflections. The most desirable situation is to design the rotating assembly to operate below the first critical speed; that produces minimal bearing loads and shaft deflections even in the transients. A 20%
separation margin between calculated critical speeds and operat ing speeds follows standard design

Torsional vibration is not normally a problem in direct-drive turbopumps due to lack of a significant forcing function and sufficient damping.

Most turbomachinery  rotors are a complex arrangement of components mounted on a shaft of variable diameter. The relationship between the rotor stiffness, mass, and damping distribution com bined with gyroscopic effects determines the rotor damped natural frequencies and associated mode shapes. The mode shape is the relative rotor deformation present when operating at a natural fre quency. Every natural frequency has a unique mode shape associated with its resonant vibration. Rotor g mode shapes provide valuable information that graphically indicate factors that are influential in =:
determining its characteristics, and, thus, provide guidance as to what design changes would be most effective in changing the natural frequencies away from the operating point.

Figure 6-62 graphically displays how physical change to the rotor supports  can alter rotating machinery critical speeds and associated mode shapes. It is apparent from this data that support stiffness is a very important rotor-dynamic param eter. Design revisions will be necessary if inadequate critical-speed margins are present. Review of the rotor mode shapes can identify design modi fications. In general, modifications to bearing and seal stiffness and damping can be effective if significant relative motion exists at that location. Modifications to the shaft bending stiffness can be effective if sufficient shaft angulation exists at the change locat ion for the m o d e  in quest ion. Modifications to the mass distribution will only be effective when significant relative motion exists at the mass location to be relocated. Common prac tice maximizes the stiffness and damping and locates the bearings as close as possible to large rotor masses.

In addition to bearing and seal stiffness and damping as a function of shaft speed, damped natural-frequency analyses include variable hydro dynamic influences. The damped critical speeds are identified as the coincidental occurrence of these natural frequencies and the shaft spin speed, as shown in Fig. 6-63.

Rotordynamic stability is controlled by pro viding an abundance of damping to suppress the destabilizing whirl drivers. These instability drivers produce tangential forces to the radial motion that oppose the damping between the rotor and housing. shaft journal. The bearings provide a relatively large source of stiffness as the main rotor support. Rolling-element bearings tend to provide a non linear support stiffness, because clearance between the bearing outer diameter and housing will be made to meet other functional requirements during tran sient axial-shaft excursions. This nonlinearity might produce nonsynchronous rotor motion at a limited amplitude, which is usually not detrimental. Hydro The tangential fo rces - -commonly  referred to as static bearings can provide superior stiffness and

The rotor stability is controlled by designing significant margin into the design. Rotor-dynamic analysis, including the various instability drivers and dampers along the rotating assembly, will predict the most unstable rotor mode. It usually will be the lowest mode because it usually has the least damping. Operating at twice the lowest mode is a common concern because seal tangential forces are near half shaft speed and are therefore potentially coincident with the lowest mode in this situation. Sufficient damping  is requi red  to prec lude instabilities, and adequate margins should be main tained. Normal design practice avoids operation within 20% of the calculated stability-threshold speed. Additionally, rotor stability is controlled by providing sufficient damping at the operating speed to ensure  a rapid vibra t ion decay after a perturbation as a measure of the system safety mar Common design techniques minimize cross- gin.

Graphical representation of rotor shaft axis and axial acting parallel to the shaft axis. In some cases, the radial loads also act to produce a tangential moment on the shaft that can be either in the direction of rotation (e.g., the tip-seal forces on turbines) or opposite the direction of rotation (e.g., the damping achieved by certain seal designs). The objective of the turbopump designer is to define any resultant loads that must be carried by the bearings and to minimize these over the operating range.

Rolling-element bearings have been used most extensively in rocket-engine turbopumps. These include both ball bearings, as seen in Fig. 6-4, and roller bearings, as seen in the turbine end of Fig. 6-9. The ball bearings can also be used as duplex pairs, as shown in Fig. 6-5. Rolling-element bearings have been used because of their high load capability independent of speed, high radial stiffness, ability to start and shut down reliably, and compatibility with the propellant fluids being used. Normally, these bearings operate directly in the propellant medium, the propellant serving to cool the bearing by a positive controlled flow. However, some propellants

For many turbopump applications, the wear rate is sufficiently low that the resulting life of the rolling element bearing more than adequately meets the turbopump requirements. Such bearings have been used very successfully in turbopumps for expendable launch vehicles.

To overcome the limitations of rolling-element bearings for long-life high-speed turbopumps, hy drostatic bearings are being introduced. These bear ings operate on a fluid film and derive their ability to sustain loads and provide required rotor-dynamic stiffness through a high-pressure supply of the propellant from the pump discharge. These bear ings also offer basically unlimited speed and pos itive damping to the turbopump rotor. There-fore, they are of particular value when high speeds are desirable and operation above one or more critical speeds is desired. Primary limitation: they must start and shut down in a rubbing contact. The ability to do this successfully has been demonstrated for certain applications and is the subject of ongoing technology developments.

Hybrid systems consisting of both rolling el ement and hydrostatic bearings can also be used where the rolling-element bearing carries the loads at start and shutdown when the hydrostatic pressure for the bearing is low. As pump speed increases, the hydrostatic pressure increases, and the hydro-static bearing begins to take an ever-increasing percentage of the applied loads because of its larger stiffness. Thus, the life of the rolling-element bearing is extended because it carries low loads at speed, and the life of the hydrostatic bearing is extended because it does not experience contact at start and shutdown. The hybrid system, of course, requires more axial length and must be designed to prevent the two bearings from fighting each other to avoid overload.

The primary types of rolling element bearings are listed in Table 6-6 along with advantages and disadvantages. Figures 6-66 and 6-67 show examples of such bearings. Various arrangements of duplex pairs of angular-contact ball bearings can be used, as shown in Fig. 6-68, to provide bidirectional axial load capability and overcome their main dis advantage. Springs are typically used to maintain axial preload of the bearings to remove internal clearance and control the radial stiffness. The springs also provide axial compliance to accom modate thermal effects. In order to provide roller guidance without end wear, some roller bearings are preloaded radially by negative internal clearance achieved through a thin-flexible outer race.

Rolling-element bearings are speed-limited due to parasitic loads from ball or roller inertia. This is typically expressed as a DN limit, defined as the product of the inner-race bore diameter D (in mm)
and the pump rotational speed N (in rpm). A practical DN limit for Conrad-type and cylindrical roller bearings is 1.6 million, while angular-contact bearings have shown reliability up to 2.1 million. However, the life of the bearings at even lower DN values may be limited because of the lubrication available and the load combinations experienced. The higher DN values lead to higher centrifugal forces, higher sliding velocities, and increased fluid churning. The propellant will also affect the DN limit; e.g., the maximum values just cited have been achieved in liquid hydrogen, but liquid-oxygen bearings have not typically been used at these limits. Note that for a given transmitted horsepower, the shaft diameter based on allowable stress does not decrease proportionally with the increase of shaft speed. Thus, the required bearing DN value rapidly increases for high-speed turbopumps. As a result, the turbopump rpm may be limited by the bearing DN value.

Ball-bearing radial stiffness ranges from 0.2-1.5 million ft -1 depending upon bearing size, contact angle, speed, mounting compliance, and applied load. As an example, the stiffness of a particular 45 mm ball bearing with 750-1b axial preload will be approximately 500,000 ft-1 at 30,000 rpm if the outer ring is allowed to tilt, but will be significantly stiffer if the outer ring is rigidly mounted. Roller-bearing stiffness is typically higher, ranging up to 2.0-million ft -1. To achieve a given stiffness, bearing design is critical to the successful control of rotor-dynamic re sponse.

During the turbopump design phase, computer programs are used to predict bearing characteristics and to optimize bearing geometry to meet design goals. Stiffness is calculated to support rotor dynamic analysis of critical speeds and unbalance response. Ball excursions determine required cage pocket-clearance and structural criteria. Fatigue life, local stresses, and sliding-velocity calculations are used to assess the effects of variations in bearing geometry and operating conditions. Although the rolling bearing is a dynamic system, it is most often

These solutions are contained in commercially available computer codes. Several of the first were written by A.B. Jones, based upon his high-speed bearing analyses (Ref. 6 12). SHABERTH (SKF Technology Services, Ref. 6 13) includes options for automatically adjusting fits and clearances in response to temperature effects on shaft and bearing materials. The ADORE computer code by Pradeep Gupta (Ref. 6-14) performs a true dynamic analysis by solving the equations of motion for the interaction of the cage with the balls and rings, and can be used to assess the effects of cage clearances and mass and geometry on cage stability.

The axial loads generated by turbopump rotors at mainstage often exceed the load capacity of ball bearings, so the function of rotor axial-position control is performed by a balance piston operated by pump internal pressure. Ball bearings with axial travel stops can limit axial motion during start and shutdown transients when loads are of short duration and within ball-bearing strength. Relatively compliant springs permit the balance piston to position the rotor without loading the ball bearings excessively.

The most commonly used material for bearing rings and balls, vacuum-melted 440-C steel, although not superior in either category, combines hard enability and corrosion resistance better than most other materials. Since short bearing life is a major constraint on engine utility, several alternative materials have been identified which may enhance life and reliability. These include CRB-7 and BG-42
steels, which have higher hardness, and the ceramic silicon nitride (Si3N4) , which is harder and 60% less dense than steel. In addition, the failure mode of the silicon nitride is generally fatigue-spalling rather than fracture. It thus appears to be a better material for the balls of a high-speed turbopump, but further demonstration of this is required. The most widely used cage material for propellant-cooled bearings is Armalon TM, a fiberglass-reinforced polytetrafluo roethylene (PTFE), or Teflon TM. The glass fabric, impregnated with PTFE, gets mandrel-wrapped under heat and pressure into a tube of near net size, and then machined to final shape. Its advantages include light weight and high strength at cryogenic temperature, and resistance to ignition in LO2. Al though the Teflon TM provides some friction reduc tion through film transfer, the glass fibers may promote wear. Friction-reducing treatments for Armalon TM include phosphate-bonded MoS 2 (which is quickly worn away) and a fused coating of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), which has shown good improvement in bearing wear-life.

To maximize propel lant-cooled-bearing life potential, a positive flow of propellant must be provided, and coolant temperature and pressure should be controlled to avoid vaporization of the fluid in the bearing. This may require maintaining high pressure in the bearing area by throttling flow downstream of the bearing. Coolant may be jet- or flood-fed, preferably to each bearing individually rather than in series. Particulate matter should be excluded by filter or traps to avoid bearing-surface damage.

A most important consideration in bearing design concerns the required operating life of the



TURBOPUMP PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 211

rocket engine. The bearings must have adequate statistical probability of exceeding this. One ac cepted life rating for rolling-element bearings, the
"B-1 life," denotes the operating life in hours at which 1.0% of a set of bearings at a fixed load and speed will have failed by contact fatigue. B-1 life is often used to show life potential, but it is recognized that the calculation methodology evaluates the fatigue life under ideal lubrication. By contrast, the bearing environmental conditions in rocket-engine turbopumps frequently lead to wear rather than fatigue. Therefore, adequate B-1 life is necessary but not sufficient to assure meeting bearing-life needs.

Hydrostatic bearings offer an attractive means of overcoming limitations of rolling bearings, as they are theoretically speed-l imited only by the centrifugal shaft stress, and thus can operate at journal speeds to approximately 5,000,000 DN. Additional benefits include increased stiffness and load capacity (with sufficient fluid pressure and flow available) and significant damping, which is minimal with rolling bearings. Since external pressurization must develop the significant load capacity, hydro static bearings are subject to rubbing during start and shutdown. Means of avoiding wear during these periods include auxilliary rolling bearings, wear resistant materials, and "prepressurization" before start. Two types of radial hydrostatic bearings are used in turbopumps: orifice-compensated and axially-fed.

Figure 6-69 illustrates a recessed, orifice-com pensated radial hydrostatic bearing. Its load ca pacity arises from fluid pressure responding to two flow restrictions in series. The pressure drop across the bearing has approximately equal steps: the first in the compensating orifice and the second in the close clearance between the journal and the lands defining the recess boundaries. A radial motion of the journal reduces the flow area on the sid e of the approach, increasing the local flow-restriction, caus ing the fluid pressure to rise in the associated recess. Simultaneously, the land flow restriction opposite is reduced, with a resultant decrease in the associated recess pressure. The relative pressure change, acting over the projected bearing area, provides a force tending to restore the journal to its original position.

Fluid forced through an annular space can generate significant stiffness across the radial gap. With the large pressures available in turbopumps, stiffnesses of over a million lb/in, can be produced. Converging clearance assures positive stiffness and enhances load capacity with minor increases in leakage flow.

Hydrostatic bearings differ from rolling bearings because the fluid film introduces significant damping and cross-coupling. The importance of these characteristics must be assessed based on rotor-dy namic response. High values of direct stiffness can be obtained by adjusting size, pressure available, and bearing geometry, somewhat independent of the fluid used, while the cross-coupling and damping generally increase with the fluid viscosity.

Hydrostatic bearings permit additional flexibility in selecting the basic turbopump configuration; the restrictions associated with the rolling-bearing DN and stiffness limits often result in a rotor con figuration that operates between critical speeds and, therefore, has significant operating-speed restrictions to maintain safety margins. By increasing the shaft and bearing stiffness, subcritical designs with less

gives a relative comparison of their effectiveness.

The face-contact seal (Fig. 6-70) provides the lowest leakage and generally will be used when the pressure-speed-life limits are consistent with reliable operation. The sealing comes through rubbing contact between a rotating mating ring attached to the shaft and the seal face. The mating ring is generally plated with a wear-resistant hard plating and is lapped fiat. The seal ring is generally a self lubricating carbon material with a fiat sealing face. The seal ring can be floating to minimize thermal distortions or can be press-fitted into a metal adapter. The seal ring is loaded against the mating ring with either a welded-metal-bellows secondary element or compression springs. The sealing dam is established to balance the pressure-induced closing forces to maintain a satisfactory face load at high pressure. The secondary sealing element can be a welded bellows, piston ring, segmented ring, or elastomer, depending on the operating require ments. Welded metal bellows are ordinarily used for temperatures below -65 or above 500"F.

Face-contact seals are speed-limited by heat generation at the rubbing face and cooling capacity of the environment. The heat generation rate is a function of the contact load and velocity of the rubbing surface. The limit is given as a PV factor, where P is the unit contact load in psi and V is the rubbing velocity in ft/s. The PV limit is based on the cooling capacity of the environment. Table 6-8
gives PV limit for typical propellants. Clearance type seals, such as labyrinth, floating-ring, or hydro static/hydro-dynamic, are used for higher speeds.

The segmented shaft-riding seal (Fig. 6-71)
consists of segmented sealing rings that are loaded against the shaft with a garter spring and the pressure differential to form a radial dynamic seal. An axial static seal is formed by loading the segments against a fiat surface on the seal housing using springs and the pressure differential. The segmented rings may consist of three rings with overlapping joints or single rings with tongue and groove joints. Having the segmented rings in rubbing contact minimizes leakage. The segments are loaded by the pressure differential and are generally limited to approx imately 100 psi.

The floating-ring seal (Fig. 6-72) consists of a solid sealing ring that is free to float in the radial direction for minimum operating clearance. The radial dynamic seal is formed by the close clearance to the shaft; the axial static seal, by loading the ring against the seal housing. The ring is partially pres sure balanced in the axial direction to control the axial load and the radial friction force. The cen tering force is provided by the pressure profile in the clearance gap. The force increases on the side approaching contact and decreases on the opposite side to give a centering force when the ring moves off center relative to the shaft. The centering force is increased by a factor of approximately 3 when a convergent taper is utilized on the seal-ring bore. The optimum taper ratio of inlet clearance to exit clearance is approximately 1.5 to 2.0 for most fluids.

Hydrostatic and hydrodynamic geometry may be utilized on face seals, segmented seals, and floating-ring seals to provide a lift force pro portional to the operating gap at the sealing surface. The lift force increases as the sealing surface approaches rubbing contact and decreases for larger gaps to form a very small (0.0005-in.) self-adjusting

(Fig. 6-73) may be used to provide hydrostatic lift. Hydrodynamic lift may be provided by Rayleigh step pads (Fig. 6-74) or spiral grooves (Fig. 6-75). The Rayleigh step pads provide hydrodynamic lift by viscous pumping of the sealed fluid in the recessed pads. The spiral grooves develop hydro dynamic lift by viscous pumping the sealed fluid in the spiral grooves. Both concepts are pressure balanced by locating the sealing dam inside of the hydrodynamic geometry. Both the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic-lift seals, as successfully tested in the laboratory, have demonstrated positive control of the quality of the sealed fluid. To date, these seals have not been used in flight turbopumps and are not as reliable if the fluid is susceptible to vaporization in the seal.

The labyrinth seal (Fig. 6-76) can be used when low cost and reliability are the primary con sideration or when the pressure and speed limits of other types of seal are exceeded. Typically, the wear rings on the rotating impellers are labyrinth seals because of the higher velocity due to the required diameter.

Labyrinth-seal designs. radial motion, the leakage is significantly higher than for the other types. Step-labyrinth seals are used to reduce the leakage by creating barriers to reduce the velocity head. The number of teeth, tooth pitch, and height will be optimized to give minimum leakage. Figure 6-77 shows typical data on the effectiveness of the labyrinth design for reducing leakage with a liquid propellant. Kel-F plastic inserts are used for oxidizer seals to allow rubbing contact without the hazard of ignition. A straight or convergent labyrinth with a knurled bore and smooth shaft provides additional dynamic stability by reducing the circumferential velocity relative to the axial leakage velocity.

Table 6-9 gives pressure and temperature limi tations for the principal types of seal. The seal type will be selected to satisfy the pressure-speed-life limits with minimum leakage and maximum reliability.

Oxidizer and fuel on a rotating shaft will usually be separated by a primary oxidizer seal, an inert-gas purged intermediate seal, and a fuel seal with separate drains for the oxidizer and fuel. The purged intermediate seal provides a pressure barrier between the drain cavities to prevent mixing of the propellants. For reliable operation, high-pressure propellants may require staged sealing to reduce the pressure at the intermediate seal. Figure 6-78 shows a representative seal system incorporating these

Some applications require a positive seal during prestart condit ioning but an open  seal during operation. For such cases, static liftoff seals are typically used that close by spring forces until in ternal pressures increase with rotation to provide a force large enough to completely open the seal. Typically, the seal will open at a shaft speed of 20 30% of the mainstage speed.

The need to operate the rocket-engine pumps at low inlet pressure frequently limits the allowable operational pump speeds. In general, the optimum turbine speed will differ from that of the pumps; and if there are significant differences in oxidizer and fuel density, it is desirable to operate the pumps at different speeds as well. Geared systems provide a means of operating all components  at opt imum speed (Ref. 6-11).

Geared tu rbopumps  find application in gas generator cycles for both storable and cryogenic propellants because of the high turbine speed re quired for the high pressure ratio and low mass flow. Upper-stage liquid-hydrogen-fueled engines are also



216 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES candidates because the large difference in density between fuel and oxidizer causes different optimum pump-speeds, and the low power level results in a geared pump being lighter than separate, direct driven fuel and oxidizer pumps.

Several major U.S. launch vehicles (Atlas, Delta, and Titan) utilize geared turbopumps for boost stages of flight, as does Japan's N-2, which is similar to the Delta. The European Ariane and the U.S. Centaur use a gear-driven LOX-LH2 turbopump.

L u b r i c a t i o n .  The method used for lubrication and cooling has a fundamental influence on the design of the gear system. Lubrication schemes are often categorized by use of oil or propellant, but the design will be most influenced by the degree of good or poor lubrication.

For small LOX/LH2 pumps (the Centaur RL10, for example), gaseous hydrogen can be used to cool the gears and bearings with lubrication supplied by dry film coatings, such as molybdenum disulfide, applied to contacting surfaces. Such coating gives poor lubrication, but allows a workable design by keeping contact loads and speeds low. Design emphasizes minimize wear.

Higher-power  applications (typically above several hundred HP) demand good lubrication. This generally means oil; but, with RP-1 (kerosene)-fueled engines, equal success has been obtained using kerosene with an extreme pressure additive (EPA) to minimize scoring of the gear. With good lubrication, turbopump gear design follows conventional prac tice, but gives special emphasis to factors significant at high pitchline speeds and tooth loadings.

Although fluid lubricating properties are im portant, flowrates and method of application are dictated by cooling requirements. Frictional heating in the gear mesh takes roughly 0.5% of the power transmitted. As pitchline velocity increases, tooth cooling becomes critical. Directing jets of lubricant at the disengaging side of the mesh, where the working flanks of the teeth are first exposed, provides efficient cooling if high jet velocities (velocities at least as large as the pitchline velocity) can overcome windage flows.

Both recirculating and single-pass oil systems are being used on larger turbopumps. The lubricant systems must be capable of meeting both gear and bearing flow-requirements. Inert-gas purges may also be used to control gearbox pressure in order to reduce lubricant foaming and to improve drainage or oil scavenging.

G e a r b o x  a r r a n g e m e n t .  Figure 6-16 shows a cross section of the turbopump used on the Delta first-stage engine. It illustrates several factors that influence the overall turbopump and gear-train layout. The pumps and turbine are usually signifi cantly larger than the gears and must interface with large fluid ducts. Therefore, packaging requirements usually force the impellers or turbine wheels to overhang the end of the shafts. It is often necessary to use idler gears or multiple reductions (even when the required speed reduction ratio could be obtained with a single mesh) to obtain sufficient spacing between pump and turbine shafts.

Gear alignment (shaft parallelism) is critical to obtaining maximum gear capacity. Highly loaded gears should, therefore, be centrally mounted between two bearings to minimize the deflection caused by the large transverse loads arising in the mesh. Gear alignment as well as the need to isolate the hot turbine housing and cold pump housing (in the case of cryogenic propellant) usually requires the gearcase structure be isolated from pump and turbine structures.

Rotor-dynamic and shaft bending limit the mass of discs, particularly on a high-speed shaft. To avoid this constraint, the turbine may be supported by its own set of bearings and linked to the high-speed pinion by means of a quill shaft that will accom modate misalignment and isolates loads.

G e a r  g e o m e t r y .  The factors that differentiate turbopump power gears from other high-speed aerospace power gears are higher tooth-face loads
(tangential force per unit tooth width) and short life. Tooth loads may be as high as 5000 lb/in, for a turbopump power gear, but life requirements are seldom longer than a few hours. These factors, along with the need for minimum weight and extremely high reliability, determine the design of the gears.

Involute spur gears have been used exclusively because of their high efficiency and simplicity. Although helical gears offer advantages by somewhat higher load capacity and smoother operation, they introduce axial loads that complicate bearing and casing design, and therefore have been avoided.

The critical concerns in gear performance are tooth-bending fatigue life, pitting fatigue life, and scoring resistance. Gear design must balance the sometimes competing parameters that affect these concerns to achieve the desired life.

Tooth bending strength is related to tooth size
(diametral pitch), pressure angle, number of teeth, and face width. Face width is generally limited to 0.5
to 0.7 times the pitch diameter of the pinion
(smaller gear) because unavoidable misalignment tends to load the tooth ends as width increases. Relatively high pressure angles (angle between a normal-to-the-tooth surface and the tangent-to-the pitch circle), typically 25 deg, are used because they allow a wider tooth base for strength and a larger radius of curvature at the point of contact to reduce hertzian contact stress.

Tooth size and number of teeth are related to the gear diameter. Smaller diameters reduce pitchline velocity and weight at the expense of higher tooth-loads. For a given pitch diameter, the larger the teeth, the smaller the contact ratio (i.e., the average number of teeth in contact at one time). High contact ratios give smoother operation (for reduced dynamic loads, especially at high pitchline velocities) and lower contact loads at the tooth tips where sliding velocity is a maximum. Contact ratio must be traded against tooth size (larger teeth provide greater bending strength). A contact ratio of 1.5 has proven near-optimum for turbopumps.

Standard tooth proportions can be modified to improve gear performance further. Pinions are frequently made with long addendums and gears made with short addendums to reduce sliding at the



TURBOPUMP PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEMS 217

pinion tip, where wear tendencies are greatest, and to strengthen the pinion, which experiences a larger number of stress cycles than the gear. Pinion teeth can be further strengthened by increasing thickness at the expense of the mating gear. The involute profile may be relieved near the tip and root to account for large elastic deflections of teeth as they enter and leave the mesh. Crowning or end-easing is also employed to prevent maximum loads from occurring at the tooth ends.

Gear materials ,  process ing ,  and quality. Materials, processing, and quality control are as essential as the basic design and geometry in meeting life requirements. For highly loaded power gears, life is generally limited by bending fatigue and wear. Deep-carburized, case-hardened steel provides high surface hardness (58-62 Rc) to gain wear re sistance and fatigue life. Vacuum-melted and forged materials can further improve fatigue properties.

Tight control of tooth-form tolerances proves critical for minimizing dynamic loads from tooth spacing errors and ensuring uniform load distri bution across the width of the teeth. To obtain the desired tooth-form accuracy without introducing detrimental  machining effects in the critically stressed fillet region at the base of the teeth, the following process may be used:

 Teeth are rough-cut before heat-treatment, leav ing a slight undercut below the working-flank surface.

 After heat treatment, the root area may be shotpeened to improve fatigue resistance further.

 Working flanks are finish-ground, taking par ticular care to avoid grinding in the fillet and root.

6.8 DESIGN LAYOUT OF TURBOPUMP ASSEMBLIES

Figure 6-79 presents the design layout of the A-1

For instance, ease of devel opment will be one of the more important criteria that influences the selection or arranging of the t u rbopump  mechanical  elements.  Standard or proven mechanical detail should be extensively adopted in the layouts. Important turbopump design layout considerations include these:

218 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Turbopump design layout demands considerable experience and skill. To illustrate the influence of some of these parameters, consider the SSME HPFTP of Fig. 6-5. The use of a scroll inlet to the first stage was driven by an engine system arrangement that would not permit an axial inlet. Also, the way the turbopump was mounted to the hot-gas manifold and the structural backbone of the engine led to a decision to limit the turbine-pitchline diameter, thereby giving up several points of turbine efficiency to reduce weight and provide better structural margin. In selecting materials for the turbine disks, no material was available that provided the structural integrity at the temperature of the hot-gas turbine drive fluid. As a result, the turbine disks had to be cooled with liquid hydrogen. However, this created an incompatibility; the hydrogen embrittled the disk material. Gold-plating the disks eliminated this prob lem.

One of the key ways to control the critical speeds is through the selection of the bearing locations. For the SSME pump in Fig. 6-5, the bearings were placed outboard, but this was driven by bearing DN limits that prevented placing the bearings over the part of the shaft that was carrying the torque. At the outboard locations the shaft diameter can be reduced because there is no shaft torque. To improve the dynamic response with these bearing locations, the pump must operate between the second and third critical-speed, and the seals must be designed to provide additional stiffness and damping. The ball bearing at the centerline of the shaft at the pump end was added after the original design to serve as a transient axial-thrust-control device (rather than using rubbing seal surfaces within the pump). This is a clutching ball bearing that carries the loads until the balance-piston pressure can take control. This usually results in the bearing being engaged until the pump speed reaches approximately 7000 rpm. Another favorable design feature of this pump is that every external seal is only required to seal the pump-inlet-pressure, which is close to 300 psi, rather than sealing the discharge pressure of 7000 psi. This was achieved by providing internal piston-ring seals {0 seal-the high pressures and venting the area under the external casing back to the inlet pressure of the pump.

In laying out the pump, it is necessary to plan the complete turbopump for assembly and, as well, disassembly with a minimum loss of parts. However, the fits required sometimes dictate that parts be assembled by selective heating/cooling of adjacent parts that prevents disassembly without destruction of one of the parts. Another consideration in the turbopump off the engine. With duplex bearing pairs, some of the bearings are generally not inspectable without turbopump disassembly. Future turbopumps will likely rely more heavily on advanced instru mentation to measure bearing condition, rather than visual inspection.

The decision to design for ease of fabrication will depend on the relative importance of other parameters. For example, in the SSME pump (Fig. 6 5) welds were used extensively rather than bolted joints, even though this significantly increased the cost and difficulty of fabrication. This was done because in the design phase of this turbopump the emphasis was on weight and performance to assure meeting all projected mission requirements.

Design of Rocket-Engine Control and Condition-Monitoring Systems

7.1 CCM---INTO A NEW ERA

The past several years have seen sophistication in creasing for rocket propulsion systems. Stricter mis sion requirements and the demand for "smart sys tems" have placed more emphasis on propulsion control system analysis, design, and implementation. To obtain the required performance characteristics and meet the tougher demands, modern control ap proaches have been developed to supplement the classical. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) tech niques, particularly expert (knowledge) systems, are expanding the methodology for enhancing control and condition-monitoring (CCM) system designs. The ability of today's microprocessors rapidly to quence may consist of systems preconditioning
(purging, chilldown); application of start energy, if required (by means of propellant tank-head pressure, solid-gas-generator turbine spinner, gas-blowdown start bottle, etc.); and introduction and ignition of the propellants in the main combustion chamber. Sec ondary sequences may be required for certain subsystems such as the gas generator. A reliable engine-start sequence may be computer-controlled and maintained by monitoring during each func tional step of engine operation during the start transient. The propellant-valve operating sequence effects either an oxidizer-lead or a fuel-lead start, usu ally as dictated by propellant type and chamber igni tion and cooling methods. During the start transient, gather, process, and analyze tremendous quantities of high-temperature spikes in the turbines and the thrust data provides the necessary capability to implement increasingly complex CCM designs.

A control system interconnects components de signed to yield a desired response or output based on a command or reference input. Two general categories of control approach enable the desired output. An open-loop (no-feedback) system does not measure the output or use it to modify the commanded input. As a result, owing to system disturbances, the controlled output can deviate from the command input by a large error. Systems that require minimal variations of the measured output from the commanded input usually embody one of many forms of closed-loop control. A closed-loop
(feedback) control system uses a comparison, or error, of the commanded input with the controlled output to influence continuously the commanded input. By minimizing the measured error, the system can be made to respond with the desired accuracy. Both of these control-system approaches will be dis cussed later in the chapter.

Selection of the control method best suited for the propulsion system--an important first step in CCM system designDwill be influenced by the re quirements analysis, required accuracy, dynamic characteristics of the engine being controlled, and particularly by engine reaction-time constraints. With the control method chosen, the basic elements for the proposed system must be selected, such as type of component for the power supply and working fluid (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic) and the op erating mechanism for specific control devices.

Basic Liquid-Propel lant-Engine Control  Systems

Most engine systems require several or all of the ba sic control systems summarized in the following paragraphs.

Engine sys tem s tar t  control.  A start-se quence control brings the engine system safely from start signal to main-stage operation. A typical se chamber can be avoided by proper sequencing of the turbine-feed circuit valves and the main-chamber control valves. Early engines used timing signals or pressure-ladder sequencing, in which valve sequenc ing was controlled by propellant pressure rise during the start transient. Figures 2-21, 3-5, 3-8, and 3-11 pre sent typical engine-system start and cutoff sequences.

Engine-system cutoff  control  Rapid and safe engine shutdown, during normal operation as well as in an emergency, allows minimum and repeatable cutoff impulse and enhances  reliable systems operation. The cutoff sequence usually consists of shutoff of subsystems power (gas generator, etc.), shutoff of main-chamber flowrate, and, in the case of test firings, postfiring securing (purges, flushes). As a rule, the propellant-valve-closing sequence will be adjusted to provide a fuel-rich cutoff in the main combustion chamber. This prevents damaging tem perature spikes and results in smooth and rapid thrust-termination.

Durat ion control  o f  engine main stage. Important considerations governing engine firing du ration have been discussed in section 2.1. The signal for in-flight cutoff, unless registering a malfunction, will be supplied by the vehicle and fed directly into the cutoff control system just discussed. For lower stages, where optimum utilization of the propellants is desired, a tank low-level sensor is often employed. In final stages, where precise cutoff velocity is essen tial, an integrating accelerometer or equivalent de vice will signal cutoff.

Engine-system safety controls. Special mon itoring devices, such as monitors for detecting combustion instability, gas-generator overtempera ture sensors, or turbopump-overspeed trips, are frequently employed to prevent undesired or unsafe conditions by effecting prompt, automatic, nonhaz ardous, fail-safe system shutdown during all phases of engine operation. In addition, most engine control systems are designed so that an interruption of electrical power supply will cause the system to shut

220 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES down safety. (For certain missions it may be de sirable to switch to an emergency power source, or prevent shutdown by mechanical latching, to con tinue operation.) Mechanical and electrical interlock devices may be used in the control system to assure the reliability of the safety control systems.

P r o p e l l a n t - t a n k  p r e s s u r i z a t i o n  con t ro l . Various propellant-tank pressurization systems have been discussed in Chapter 5. Most propellant-tank systems employ closed-loop control of pressuriza tion. Design requirements for the control of these systems must consider Means to maintain the required tank pressure level within an allowable range during all phases of vehicle and engine systems opera tion, including steady-state engine mainstage;
start or dynamic throttle-transients; and vehicle coasting periods between restarts. Effective safety devices such as pressure-relief valves to prevent overpressurization and rup ture of the propellant tanks. Compatibility with other subsystem controls, such propellant-utilization-control and thrust control systems.

Engine-sys tem c o n t r o l  ca l ibra t ion .  Control systems described in the preceding paragraphs re quire proper adjustment and calibration to produce the desired engine operating characteristics and per formance. This includes the programming of control computers ,  setting of t iming devices, pressure switches, position switches, and sizing of orifices. The correct values for each of these will be verified dur ing engine-calibration and checkout firings. For en gines with fixed sea-level thrust, orifices may be placed in propellant lines for performance-parame ter calibration, others in pneumatic or hydraulic lines as timing and restricting devices.

Engine-sys tems  c h e c k o u t  and  tes t  controls . To verify operational readiness of the engine system and its subsystems, suitable controls must cover postassembly and prefiring checkouts. These permit simulation of engine operation and its critical con trol components, without actually firing the engine system. Utilizing suitable ground-support equipment
(GSE), an engine checkout control system should in c l u d e d

Provisions to conduct leak and electrical-con tinuity checks of the entire engine system. Provisions for verifying proper operation of all instrumentation pickups, such as dc bus voltage and sparkplug firing monitors, and open, closed, and cont inuous-posi t ion signals for valves, propellant flowmeters, and pressure transducers. Provisions for verifying the proper function and operating range of all control devices and subsystems, such as flow-control valves, pres sure regulators, and thrust and mixture-ratio control devices. Provisions to simulate vehicle signals for
"cold" checkout of the engine system's operat ing sequence, such as for start and cutoff.

In addition to the checkout equipment, the engine GSE must include equipment to permit control of static-test firings.

Engine Thrust-Level Control

The significance of the thrust level of a liquid-propel lant rocket engine (sea level or vacuum) has been explained in section 2.1. Fixed-thrust engines usually have this level specified with a tolerance, for in stance, "+3%." Throttleable engines have it specified as a tolerance band across the thrust range. It is pos sible for "fixed-thrust-level" engines to guarantee this band with simple orifice calibrations in the various propellant subsystems of the engine, without resort to closed-loop systems, and with a minimum of calibra tion firings. However, thrust regulators or controllers may be employed in vehicle systems that require a higher degree of precision and repeatability, such as in single-stage vehicles starting at sea level, or in final stages of a multistage system. Thrust regulators are actually chamber-pressure regulators; and at altitude
(vacuum) they in effect act identically to thrust regu lators, since, at altitude, thrust for a given engine and mixture ratio is solely a function of chamber pres sure. The same is essentially true for systems starting at sea level, because the relationship of thrust to chamber pressure as a function of altitude is pre dictable with high accuracy.

Occasionally, vehicle missions will require in flight thrust control over a wider range. Usually, in such cases, the need is for a planned reduction of thrust, or "throttling," during the last portion of pro:
pelled flight. This can be done by one or the other of two basic procedures--stepwise reduction of cham ber pressure (pc) or continuous reduction of pc. Each can be accomplished by control of Turbine power ( in the case of turbopump-fed systems), through regulation of gas-generator propellant flow rate or hot-gas flow rate. Main-propellant-flow rate. Variation of main-tank pressures (in the case of pressure-fed systems).

Additionally, in multiple (clustered) engine sys tems, stepwise thrust reduction can be effected by shutoff of one or more engines of the subsystems.

Propellant-Mixture-Ratio and Propellant Utilization Control

The significance of propellant mixture ratio and its control have been discussed in section 2.1. Mixture ratio control will be needed principally to gain op timum engine performance (vs. mixture ratio) and good propellant utilization; i.e., minimum residuals. Both goals are closely interrelated and essentially in separable.

Open- loop m i x t u r e  ra t io  c o n t r o l  Installation of properly sized calibration orifices in the main propellant lines forms the simplest mixture-ratio control. Other factors affecting engine mixture ratio during flight, such as propellant-density changes due



CONTROL AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 221

to heating and acceleration, can be calculated for their effect on mixture ratio, and an averaging of flight mixture ratio can be used to reduce propellant residuals. Selection of the corresponding orifice size reduces mixture-ratio deviations over the duration of flight to a level acceptable for optimum total propel lant utilization in many missions. Open-loop mixture ratio control can often be further refined by the fol lowing procedures:

Weighing of the propellants loaded; i.e., accu rate determination of the tanked-propellant mixture ratio. The vehicle to be launched rests on load cells, thus permitting weighing of the propellants actually loaded. In mixed sys tems, the noncryogenic component is loaded and weighed first. The cryogenic component follows and is subsequently maintained at level through a topping line. The mass of both pro pellants will be determined from on-the-spot temperature and ambient pressure readings during the tanking procedure.

Use of adjustable, rather than fixed, orifices in one or both propellant lines. As close to vehi cle takeoff as possible, and as a function of tanked weight and temperature readings, a hand or remotely ground-controlled orifice adjustment is made. This method is usually confined to noncryogenic fluids.

For systems where engine operation closely fol lows that obtained during final calibration, remark able accuracy, approaching that of a closed-loop sys tem (single stages, first stages), of targeted mixture ra tio and thus propellant utilization can be obtained with the open-loop method.

In certain applications, however, the variation of mixture ratio as a function of increasing acceleration may exceed tolerable limits. Acceleration in most vehicle arrangements affects predominantly the pro pellant in the forward tank. Because of the long sup ply line, acceleration continues to act upon a rela tively large fluid column, even near the end of pow ered flight (tank depletion). By comparison, the ef fect on the fluid in the rear tank is often nearly com pletely offset by the simultaneous decrease in fluid head (short liquid-column).

To offset excessive acceleration effects on the fluid from the forward tank and thus on mixture ratio, head-suppression valves are sometimes used at the pump inlet of turbopump-fed systems. Here, pump inlet-pressure increase is sensed as a function of ac celeration. Corresponding signals are fed through a logic device to the head-suppression valve, gradually closing it and thus acting as a inlet-pressure throttling device.

Closed- loop mix ture - ra t i o  con t ro l  Certain cases may require a closed-loop sys tem--such as high-velocity-increment upper  stages or missions requiring engine restart following extensive cruising periods involving propellant boiloff. In a closed loop system, the mixture ratio is controlled and compared to a command or reference mixture-ratio by a feedback system that minimizes the difference between the command signal and the mixture ratio at which the engine is operating. Figure 7-1 shows the A-4 Stage engine-mixture-ratio control loop; it uses continuous sensing of propellant mass flow to establish the ratio of propellants consumed. The mixture-ratio feedback (MR) b can then be compared with a command reference mixture-ratio input (MR)r in the propellant-utilization control computer. The resulting error signal (MR)e is fed to the mixture-ra tio-control vernier position actuator for the oxidizer valve. The actuator forms a link in the mechanical coupling between the two main propellant-control valves. The oxidizer flow rate can thus be modified to eliminate the error. In high-thrust turbopump-fed engine systems, such as the A-2 Stage engine, where the propellant valves are independently actuated, the system's propellant-mixture ratio can be controlled by varying the main oxidizer flow in a similar manner. For instance, a propellant-utilization servo control valve, which regulates the pneumatic pressure to the main oxidizer-valve actuator, may control the oxidizer flow by adjusting the angular position of the oxidizer valve during mainstage operation of the engine.

It can readily be seen that control systems, based on propellant-flow-rate measurements, are basically still mixture-ratio controls and thus merely "assume,"
but do not measure directly, the amount of propel lants actually remaining in the tanks and their unbal ance. To accomplish this "propellant utilization"
PU, additional control elements must be employed in the form of vehicle tank-level sensors. Numerous means for this are known: point-sensing, sonar, acoustic, radiation-sensing, differential-pressure, and capacitance probes.

222 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES quantities in the main tanks are continuously moni tored, summed, and compared with a PU-reference in the PU-control computer. Any error detected is used to modify the command reference mixture-ratio in put (MR) r to the mixture-ratio-control computer. This method isolates the mixture-ratio control from the P U control, and thus prevents interaction be tween them. The bandwidth of the PU control system is made narrower than the mixture-ratio control sys tem's, because residual-propellant errors may be ex pected to develop slowly; i.e., initial tanking errors can be corrected over the entire duration of engine operation.

The sensors used in the vehicle tanks may serve additional purposes. In combination with suitable ground equipment, they may permit an automatically controlled loading, high-level limiting and topping procedure. In static firings and flight, they may serve as redundant low-level sensors to initiate engine cut off.

A closed-loop mixture-ratio- and PU-control sys tem may be used not only for accurate maintenance of a fixed mixture ratio; it also has the potential for p rogrammed  mixture-ratio control  (PMR) during flight, either continuously or in steps. It must be kept in mind that the average mixture ratio still must be equal to the tanked mixture ratio to assure simultane ous propellant depletion. However, by programming a mixture ratio in favor of the heavier component during the early portion of flight, and then switching it in favor of the lighter one, the accelerated vehicle mass will be reduced faster. Also, mixture ratio may be programmed to provide a higher thrust level dur ing the steeper portion of a trajectory. This provides a better thrust-to-weight ratio in the presence of grav itation, with attendant velocity benefits. These meth ods, possibly in combination, may substantially in crease stage payload, since the effects of mixture ra tio on performance (Is) are usually small within a reasonable range (see Table 7-1).

Differences between fuel and oxidizer pump characteristics as a function of speed. Line-resistance changes as a function of tem perature and for miscel laneous mechanical reasons.

Each of these factors must be considered first evaluating the need for a closed-loop PU system as well as the mixture-ratio control range required to properly minimize residuals.

Thrust-Vector Control

Steering a vehicle over the desired trajectory em ploys thrust-vector control (TVC). The following methods have found application.

1) Gimballed thrust chamber or engine assembly
(widely used).

2) Gimballed thrust-chamber nozzle (rare with liquid propellants).

3) Jet vanes in the nozzle section of the thrust chamber (obsolescent).

4) Secondary injection (into the thrust chamber).
5) Auxiliary jets.

The first method is used most frequently, due to its inherent reliability and performance. The first three systems require actuators that may be operated b y  hydraulic, pneumatic, or electric means. The re maining systems are controlled by flow regulation.

TVC sys t ems  using ac tuators .  Figure 7-3
presents a simplified schematic for a TVC system employing hydraulic or pneumatic actuators. It can serve to explain the fundamentals of closed-loop TVC, even through the systems used in practice may differ significantly in detail. The actuators are controlled by commands, originating in the vehicle's guidance system, the commands being a function of the vehicle's deviations from a prescribed path and of its response to corrective steering action. The command signals are fed through an electronic TVC logic to servovalves. In the system shown in Fig. 7-3,

each servovalve modulates the fluid flow to its re spective actuator assembly in response to an electri cal error signal proportional to the difference be tween desired actuator position and its actual posi tion. Feedback of the actual position is obtained through a transducer attached to the actuator. Ad ditionally, a rate transducer senses the actuating speed and applies it to the control computer to stabi lize the closed-loop control through adequate damp ing. Instead of a rate transducer, electronic differen tiation of the position transducer output may serve the same end. Malfunction safety circuits make en gine cutoff in the event of erratic operation.

Figure 7-4 shows a typical schematic for a TVC system using electromechanical actuators powered by a reversible 28-volt dc motor. The control computer consists of summing junctions and an amplifier, as in the case of hydraulic actuators. The dc motor driv ing the actuator is controlled by the error signal gen erated by comparing the guidance-command refer ence input with systems-position feedback. To pro vide adequate systems damping, a rate generator or differentiation of the posit ion signal gives the actuating speed.

Engine-to-vehicle interfaces with actuator systems. Many factors affect efficient actuator per formance.

Engine installation and alignment. To keep demands to the minimum on the vehicle's guidance and engine-actuation systems, the engine thrust vec tor must be properly prealigned with respect to the vehicle attachment point in all three planes. Typical specified tolerances are +0.25 in. laterally and +0.5"
vertically.

The significance of good thrust alignment can be seen from the fact that in an engine cluster, at the randomly distributed maximum of these tolerances, a trim deflection of close to 0.5" would be required from all engines to offset the misalignment.

For larger (looser) alignment tolerances, the trim deflection would be further increased. Even if the trim deflections seem to reduce effective thrust and guidance capability only slightly, the need to apply them for the full duration of powered flight would appreciably reduce payload.

It is customary to align the engine thrust vector to the upper face of the gimbal bearing before ship ment. Both optical and dynamic methods (load cells) are used. The optical (cold) alignment estab lishes the geometrical location of the thrust vector in the shop, by finding the centers of nozzle throat and nozzle exit and aligning their connecting line per pendicu!ar to the gimbal plane. A simple plumb at tached to the injector center can aid this operation. Subsequently, during engine firing, this measurement may be confirmed dynamically using side-load cells in lieu of gimbal actuators. As a rule, after a few en gines have been aligned in this manner, experience will permit meeting specification by optical means alone. The vertical alignment can be documented simply as the eye-to-eye distance of the actuator at tach points or as the line through two index points
(Fig. 7-5). Lateral dimensions can be marked in a suitable manner at or on the gimbal bearing face. If the mating vehicle face has been properly aligned to

Figure 7-5 shows installation methods of a prealigned engine into the vehicle. For the first vehicles of a new type produced, it is advis able to specify verification of engine alignment fol lowing transportation to the launching site.

Actuators, loads. Actuators can be of the hy draulic-piston, hydraulic-rotary, or electromechanical type. Gimbal actuators are attached to the engine at one end and to the vehicle at the other (Fig. 7-5). They may be procured by the vehicle builder or by the engine builder, but must be properly dimen sioned. The attachment points at either end must be capable of absorbing, with an adequate reserve, the forces encountered. As a rule, two actuators will be required for each engine. Together, they permit de flection of the engine in all directions. It is impor tant to note that, if an individual actuator produces a maximum deflection of, say, 7 deg, the consequence will be approximately 10 deg of maximum angle
("corner deflection") from a pair of actuators. The ducts, flex lines, gimbal bearing, and possibly other components affected must be able to "take" this de flection.

Selection and design of the actuators is based on the gimbal forces required. In a typical case, the ac

The force is determined by considering inlet-duct reactions, flexible serviceline reactions, gimbal bearing friction, heat-shield reaction (if any), correction for misalignments, aerodynamic loading
(if any), vehicle acceleration effects, inertia of gim balled mass, and miscellaneous minor effects.

The engine design must reduce these forces to a minimum for the smallest size and lightest weight of the actuators and associated equipment. Recognition of this need and careful design can do much toward this goal. The system must be capable of stable, well damped response when cold gimballed, such as dur ing prelaunch checkout, even though the loads en countered there may be quite different from those occurring during engine firing. This dual-load situa tion may pose serious problems.

During startup of the engine, brief peak  side loads, in excess of those occurring during normal gimballing, can be generated by the thrust chamber itself, especially with high-expansion-area nozzles be ing developed at sea level. Unless these loads can be eliminated or at least reduced, they must be consid ered in the design of actuators and attach points at both ends.

Crosstalk and spring rate. Since the engine and vehicle designers are not entirely independent regarding actuator installation, a situation may exist wherein motion of the actuator in one plane affects the other actuator it its plane. This is referred to as
"crosstalk." Excessive crosstalk may develop control instabilities. The engine designer and vehicle builder need close coordination to minimize crosstalk.

The actuator must be able to translate its motion without delay into engine deflection. If the control loop formed by actuator, engine structure, and vehi cle thrust-structure is "soft, "--if it has a low spring rate (lb/in.)--the engine will not react promptly to an actuator motion as called for by the guidance sys tem, but rather delay, with subsequent overshoot and continued oscillation. The natural frequency of this oscillation is a function of actuator stroke per degree of engine deflection, feedback gains, and compensa tion-network parameters.

Secondary injection. Thrust vector control through secondary injection of matter into the thrust chamber nozzle ("SITVC") has been successfully ap plied to solid motors. It has found only limited, and then predominantly experimental, application in liq uid-propellant propulsion systems, where it appears promising for upper-stage engines, in which the lat eral forces required are smaller than with boosters. Secondary injection employs, principally, gas injec tion using inert stored gas, thrust-chamber tapoff [Fig.
7-6(a)], or a gas generator [Fig. 7-6(b)] or liquid injec tion [Fig. 7-6(c)] using inert fluid or propellants.

In a gimballed thrust chamber, the side force acts approximately at the injector end. With an SlTVC system, the applied side force acts downstream of the nozzle throat and approximately at the point of in jection, resulting in a longer moment arm, which de creases the required side force.

Performance evaluations. The performance of any type of secondary injection system is based upon two performance factors: amplification K and axial-thrust augmentation K1, defined as follows:

K - Iss _ Fs/vCs __ Fs/Fp (7-: a)
ISp Fp/wp Ws/iCp

Essentially, the K factor determines the quantity of fluid required to obtain the side force, and the K1
factor determines the penalty on the overall system Is to obtain the required side-force. Both of these factors known, the total effect of a given secondary injection system on a propulsion system may be de termined. The K factor determines the quantity of secondary injectant fluid required (for a known duty cycle). The K1 factor evaluates the Is penalty on the propulsion system. If K1 equals 1, the specific im pulse of the secondary fluid will equal that of the primary fluid, and therefore the propulsion system will suffer no Is penalty due to the SlTVC system.

Both the amplification factor K and the thrust augmentation factor K 1 are influenced by the sec ondary-injection orientation. For each application, a tradeoff must be made between the two factors to de

termine the optimum injection orientation for  max imum propulsion efficiency. Side forces for a given w s are increased if injection is made through a series of holes arranged on a horizontal arc, rather than through a single orifice. Note that the manifolds re quired in this case may adversely affect response, however. In a typical tapoff SITVC system, the gas flow rate may be 1.5 to 2.5 percent of the primary flow rate, the upper value indicating the situation of maximum force required between two injection sta tions (two jets operating).

The performance of a gas generator SITVC sys tem is comparable to that of a tapoff system, proba bly slightly better. This if offset by higher complexity
(valves, injectors, ignition, cooling).

Liquid injection systems (inert fluid or propel lants) offer the simplest arrangement. This is offset by their lower performance, K-factors being in the order of unity, at flow rates from 5 to 6 percent of the primary flow. However, in systems with low-duty cy cles, they may still be very attractive.

As a rule, four injection elements are required for a given system, equally spaced on the main chamber circumference, of which no more than two adjacent ones would be operating at a given time. The control of the required valves is accomplished through a logic and a servosystem analogous to that of a hy draulic gimbal actuator system.

CCM Concept and Preliminary Design Deve lopment

Before actual control-system logic development, mis sion requirements must be defined and functional analyses performed. Developing and selecting the most suitable CCM system and components  for a particular application will be aided by the method ology shown in Fig. 7-7. It covers both classical and modern control-system design, and is representative of current usage in government and aerospace orga nizations for CCM system selection (Ref. 7-1).

Requirements  generat ion and analysis. Basic CCM requirements are generated by the cus tomer with contractor participation. Typically, tech nical requirements for a CCM system flow down from the mission, vehicle, and engine requirements. Fig ure 7-8 outlines sample CCM system-requirement considerations based on this flow-down. The level and scope of requirement considerations for any particular application vary widely, depending on the customer and magnitude of the program.

Functional analysis~allocation. Performed in the concept and preliminary-design phases after the complete set of requirements has been generated, functional analysis consists of determining what must be done by the CCM system to meet the mission requirements. Figure 7-8 outlines representative func tional-analysis considerations. Functional flow dia grams usually aid an analysis. Figure 7-9 shows an example of a functional flow diagram for a typical orbital-transfer-vehicle (OTV) engine. The functional analysis will define the major components  and internal and external interfaces of the CCM system.

Synthesis. Functional-analysis allocations will be used in the synthesis of several candidates for

CCM architecturemthe fundamental organization of the CCM system. The following must be accounted for in defining an architecture configuration: hier archical levels of control, distributed processing vs. centralized processing, functional emphasis, subsys tem partitioning, software architecture, and redun dancy configurations.

Once defined, candidate CCM systems can be modeled and simulations run to define their perfor mance in terms of meeting the system requirements. Trade studies between the candidate systems will use the simulation results. Evaluations are usually con ducted in terms of selected system-parameter values or performance characteristics as defined in the re quirements phase of the analysis. The CCM concept that best satisfies the mission needs goes into devel opment.

Figure 7-10 shows a representative example of a modern control-system architecture, the SSME Block
11 controller. It is a dual redundant system with cross-strapping between the three major subsys temswinput  electronics, data processor, and output electronics--designed so that no single-point failure will ever cause the system to malfunction. A first fail ure causes switchover to an alternative channel of electronic hardware/software. A second failure in the alternate channel causes electrical/hydraulic lockup
(engine valves and controls maintained in position)
or safe shutdown (depending on the operational pro file). This redundancy approach is termed fail-op erate~fail-safe.

Control Methods

As mentioned earlier, control systems may be gener ally classified as either open-loop or closed-loop.

Open-loop control Figure 7-11 shows a generic example of this type of control system along with its advantages and disadvantages. This system uses preset controls, such as orifices and on-off command devices.

A typical example of open-loop control, an en gine propellant-flow system calibrated to a fixed set of conditions, has the propellant flows controlled simply by opening and closing the propellant valves. Thus, minor deviations from the design mixture ratio or propellant flow rates, such as from fabrication tol erances of engine components, can be corrected be forehand by insertion of accurately sized orifices into the propellant-flow lines to effect the desired pres sure drops. The extent of correction would be de termined from preflight-calibration test data. Open loop control has the advantage of simplicity, but it is limited to a specific set of operating parameters, and is unable to compensate for variable conditions dur ing operation.

Accurate sequencing of an open-loop control system as may be used for engine start and stop, usu ally with the aid of interlocks. For example, the pro pellant valves of many small engines or gas genera tors are mechanically linked and are operated by a single actuator. Adjusting the relative positions of the valve gates or poppets, with respect to the me chanical linkage, will properly sequence fuel and oxi dizer valves.

Closed-loop contro l  Also called feedback control, this type of system usually includes sensors to measure control or engine-operating parameters, microprocessors to analyze the sensor data, and effectors to implement the control strategy. Unlike open-loop control, closed-loop control depends on the magnitude of an error signal (deviation of desired output from measured output) to bring about a correction. In general, closed-loop control aims to minimize errors during operation and reduce system sensitivity to environmental changes and changes in component characteristics. It is applied to areas such as engine thrust control and/or throttling, pro pellant mixture-ratio control, and thrust-vector con trol. Figure 7-12 shows a generic closedqoop control system and points out the advantages and disad vantages of this type of system.

A desire to make rocket-engine control more ro bust and stringent has brought about enhancements to the classical closed-loop diagram of Fig. 7-12.

Optimal control strategies try to optimize the system with respect to a chosen operating parameter. In an adaptive-control approach, loop operating character istics are changed to maintain control for pre dictable departures from the normal control mode. Closely related to the adaptive strategies are the knowledge-based (expert system) control approaches. Here, the control system has the ability to change loop operating characteristics to maintain control for unpredictable departures from the normal con trol mode. An onboard, real-time computerized sys tern performs operating-system identification, devel ops a revised set of control laws, and then uses the adaptive component of the system to control the en gine or vehicle. Figure 7-13 shows a schematic dia gram of a CCM system design using an expert system with adaptive control.

This section discusses ap proaches that can be used in the design and devel opment of a control system.

C l a s s i c a l  con t ro l .  Classical control method ology is applicable to control design problems in which the characteristics of the system to be con trolled are not precisely known or in which sim plifying assumptions can be made if the system is complex. Classical control views each system com ponent as a block in which the input and output are related by a transfer function. This approach simplifies the solution by combining the behavior of the internal components of the system to be con trolled into one system block (transfer function) to c( t )

Classical control is applicable to both open- and closed-loop designs. Being a single input-single out put (SlSO) approach, it does not have the ability of multiloop control system design in the strictest sense;
but, some classical quasi-multiloop techniques have been developed.  Classical control methodology must confine itself in practice to a lumped-parame ter, linear, time-invariant modeling representation, with either stochastic, deterministic, or discrete time capability.



230 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

The usual classical approach.to a single-loop sys tem designs the control loop on an individual basis by using one of the techniques mentioned below. For multiloop control systems, the loops are de signed on an individual basis, normally resulting in various degrees of cross-coupling between them. The remainder of the system design consists of enhanc ing or eliminating the cross-coupling between the loops (using the methods described here under
"Classical Multiloop Design Techniques") to achieve the best possible compromise  design for the in tended application. Classical control design can also be used to design both single and multiloop adaptive systems (i.e., when control operating regime changes can be predicted) by providing for gain changes
(gain scheduling). This type of approach has been used on the SSME. Recently, classical control methodology designs, incorporating learning (ex pert) capability (i.e., when control operating regimes are used to define a "knowledge-base") have been receiving great attention.

Classical l inear design techniques. The primary design approaches used in linear, classical control are the time- and f requency- response techniques. In the time-response approach, a step, ramp, parabolic, or impulse signal is used as an input into a control system to define its output characteris tics in terms of a mathematical model of the system. Analytically, the Laplace transform is often used to transform the model from the time domain to the complex S-Plane domain. The problem is therefore transformed from a set of t ime-dependent  differ ential equations to a set of t ime-independent alge braic equations. The solution to the algebraic set is then transformed back into the time domain by using the inverse Laplace transform.

In the time domain, system response characteris tics and requirements can be specified in terms of delay time td, rise time, tr, peak time tp, peak over shoot Mp, settling time ts, and steady-state error. Figure 7-14 shows a representative t ime-response wave.

Performance indices may also be used to evalu ate CCM performance during system development. Frequently used performance indices for a control law development in the time domain are the follow ing:

ITS? = j t e 2 ( t ) d t  (7-5)

Complimentary to the t ime-domain response technique, the frequency-response approach uses si nusoidal signals as inputs to determine the output characteristics of the system in the frequency do main. The output is displayed by means of Bode plots, root-locus diagrams, Nyquist diagrams, Nichols charts, and/or  inverse Nyquist diagrams. Lengthy discussions of both the time- and frequency-domain approaches can be found in basic control textbooks
(Ref. 7-2 through 7-6).

Classical nonlinear design techniques. Two additional techniques in classical control can aid the design of nonlinear systems: the describing function and the phase plane.

Describing function. The describing function, essentially a generalized transfer function for nonlin ear systems, based on a restricted mathmatical foun dation, is easy to apply, gives reasonable results, and can be used for systems of any order. The analysis assumes that a sinusoidal signal input to a nonlinear element has an output signal with the same funda mental period as the input. It is further assumed that all harmonics, subharmonics, and dc components can be neglected (a reasonable assumption for most feedback situations). And it is assumed that the feed back control system has only one nonlinear compo nent, and that time-invariant. Describing functions are generated from Fourier series analysis of the out put waveform. Once the nonlinearity has been char acterized, various methods of compensating for it, such as reducing system gain, adding a phase-lead network, or introducing rate feedback, can be exam ined. Nyquist diagrams and Nichols charts are the most revealing techniques for stability analysis for the describing-function approach

Phase plane. Although associated with the clas sical approach, the phase-plane method, a state space analysis, specifically concerns the solution of a second-order, nonlinear, time-invariant differential equation. It is a technique for analyzing the transient response of a feedback control system to a step input or for solving an initial-condition problem. Dif ferent curves of displacement vs. velocity, called tra jectories, are generated for a series of step functions. The resulting family of curves defines the phase portrait. If the trajectory approaches infinity, the system is unstable. If the trajectory circles the origin continuously in a closed curve, a sustained oscillation
(limit cycle) results. If the phase trajectory ap proaches the origin, the system is stable.

There are three procedures to construct the phase portrait of a system. Two are analytical: direct solution of the differential equation and transforma tion of the second-order differential equation to a first-order one. The remaining, a graphic method, isoclines, is the most useful of the three.

Classical multiloop design techniques. In recent years, the classical approach has been ex


C O N T R O L  AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 231

tended for certain limited cases to multi-input, multi output  (MIMO) systems. A transfer-matrix approach is used to diagonalize or decouple the system repre sentative with a shaping-function matrix. The decou pied-loops can then be designed with such SISO techniques as the direct or inverse Nyquist array or direct or inverse characteristic-locus methodologies.

Control l a w s .  The following equation expresses the most general  and standard control l a w w t h e proportional-integral-differential (PID) control:

{P} {D} {I}

de K c t p = Kce + KcZD~- ~- + ~ e d t  + Ps (7-6)

t I u where  K = gain, I: = derivative time (min)
c D

1: I = integral time (min), e = error, and Ps = constant

Generally, it will be preferable to use the simplest procedure possible in designing the control system. However, using only the proportional mode results in degraded static accuracy caused by inherent offset error. Adding integral control eliminates the offset but may cause large overshoot.  The addit ion of derivative control achieves more rapid transient re sponse and tends to decrease initial errors. Various combinations, such as proportional integral (PI) and proportional differential (PD), can meet the control requirements. If the controller cannot meet the con trol requirements, it will be necessary to design a compensator  to move the control design into a re gion where the system design can provide accurate transient-and-stable operation.

Class ica l  con t ro l  s y s t em example s .  An example,  a multi loop system, will demonstrate  the modern approach to classical control-system design. By showing how the system is modeled and control laws written, both single input /output  and multiple input /output  type problems can be covered simulta neously.

M u l t i l o o p - o u t p u t - c o n t r o l  e x a m p l e  (Ref. 7-7). A two-input, two-output regulator system (Fig. 7-15) is required to control the temperatures T1 and T 2 of a propellant in two interconnected tanks. The desired t empe ra t u r e s  Trl  and and Tr2 are set on input potent iometers  that supply the command voltages Erl and Er2. The tank temperatures are sensed by thermistors whose outputs E01 and E02 are compared to the command voltages to obtain the errors e. The controller uses these to synthesize a control law u. The controller output  signals Ul and u 2 are boosted by thyristor amplifiers that supply power  to resis tance heaters (Fig. 7-15). Let w denote the product of the volumetric flowrate, density, and specific heat of the propellant and Td the entrance temperature. Let C1 and C2 denote  the thermal capacitances of the tanks, and q l and q2 be the heat per unit-time gener ated by the heaters. Then conservation of energy for each tank yields dT 1

q2 = c4u2 (7-10)

where the constants c 3 and c4 include the power-am plifier gains. Letting Xl = T1, x2 = T2, gl = C1/w and I; 2 = C2/w. Using Eq. (7-9) and (7-10) in Eq. (7-7) an

Having formulated the mathematical representation of the system, a control scheme must be chosen. In this example, a PI controller was designed for each of the outputs. The system and disturbance matrices are given by Eq. (7-16). Assume that tl = t2 = 10 and bl  b 2 - 100. With these parameter values the matrices b e c o m e  100 100

(7-18)

A matrix, the decoupling compensator  matrix, will make the plant matrix Gp(s) relating output (Y(s)) to the control U(s) become a diagonal matrix. This greatly simplifies the solution procedure. The de coupling compensator matrix is chosen a s  1 G12(s) ]
G(s) = (7-19)

Post-multiplying Gp from Eq. (7-18) by G(s) yields GpG =

We want  this matrix to be diagonal; therefore, s e t  0.1
G12(s) -- 0 G21(s) - - s+0.1

In this case the diagonal elements of Eq. (7-20) are identical to the diagonal elements of the system ma trix in Eq. (7-18). Now individual PI controllers can be designed for the two uncoupled systems by em ploying the techniques of single-input, single-output systems. Figure 7-17 shows the resulting control sys tem. Each of the two uncoupled  systems is desig nated as second-order,  and the two controller gains can be set to yield the desired natural frequency and damping ratio.

M o d e r n  c o n t r o l  As just shown, classical con trol theory uses input-output  relationships, princi pally the transfer function. After being written, the differential  equa t ions  descr ibing the system are linearized and subjected to constraints to allow for useful input-output relationships. In contrast to the classical approach,  modern  control theory makes direct use of the differential equations in the solution approach.

Modern control theory system representat ions do not obscure the internal behavior of the system, as classical theory may do with the transfer function, and are not limited to linear stationary systems. In theory, there are no limitations to the applicability of modern  control theory; but practical limitations do exist. Although it may be possible to represent the system as a set of simultaneous differential equations, it may prove impossible to find solutions. Therefore, the modern  approach makes frequent use of digital computers and numerical solutions.

A great deal of research is being done in modern control theory to make its powerful techniques more convenient  and practical. Whichever version of the modern  approach is chosen, extensive use will be made of the concept of state space.

S t a t e - v a r i a b l e  r e p r e s e n t a t i o n .  The "state" of a system means the smallest set of variables that must be known at some time to to predict unique ly  the future behavior of the system for any specified input. Although the state of the system is unique at any instant of time, a set of state variables is not. The individual set of state variables chosen must  be linearly independent.

For example, the second-order differential equa tion for a mass-spring-damper system with an exter nal forcing function may be written as follows:

md2x/dt2 + Bdx/dt + k x  = fa(t) (7-21)

Replacing x by Xl and dx/dt by x2 allows the second order differential equation to be written as a set of two first-order equations:

dx l /d t  = x 2 (7-22)

dx2/dt = - (k /m)xl  - (B/m)x2 + (fa/m) (7-23)

The variables x l and x 2 are called the state variables since they define the state of the system (they are just

Fig. 7-17 Control system for multiple output. another form of writing the differential equat ion of motion of the system). These two variables may then be considered to be the components  of a state vector x. State space is then def ined as the two-dimen sional space with Xl and  x2 as the coordinates. For larger systems with more  defining equat ions ,  the number of state variables will grow accordingly.

For a linearized system, it is always possible to write generalized vector equations relating the output vector y to the state vector x and control vector u as follows:

dx/dt  = A(t)x + B(t)u + Blv (7-24)

y = C(t)x + D(t)u (7-25)

where A(t) is the plant or system matrix and B(t) is the control matrix. The C and D matrices relate the output variables y to the state x and control u vari ables. Modern control theory deals broadly  with solving and manipulating these two equations. How does this system treat a control law of the following form?

u =-Kx + Nr (7-26)

where r is the command input vector, K the gain ma trix, and N a scaling matrix. As formulated, the prob lem is not well-posed: there are more unknowns  than equations. To circumvent this, se t  K = pkT (7-27)

The resulting closed-loop characteristic equation be c o m e s  ]sI = A + BpkT[ = 0 (%29)

which is identical to the characteristic equation of a single-input system. Continuation of the example

while the A and B matrices of Eq. (7-13) become [_.0101 [1000]
A = B =

In the example, the desired temperature values are set by the potentiometers; and if they remain fixed, there will not be a change in the command input vector so that r = 0. We wish to design a regulator for the system. In Eq. (7-26), u = -Kx, arbitrarily select Pl

Matching the corresponding coefficients of Eq. (7-30)
and (7-31) gives kl = 12.363 and k2 - 2.431. Figure 7 18 shows the structure of this regulator. The transfer function relating the output vector to the disturbance is obtained from m

these are the steady-state errors.

This example gives some indication of the power of modern control theory. With the block diagram of the system (Fig. 7-18) and the governing equations, the designer can define a controller to eliminate the steady-state errors. It is also possible to experiment mathematically with different system parameters and input conditions.

This brief overview of control-system analysis and design has presented examples to demonstrate the application of the theory to an engineering prob lem. Complete development of all of the concepts introduced along with numerous examples can be found in Ref. 7-2 through 7-8.

trolled include propellants, pressurants, and control system fluids (hydraulic or pneumatic). This section discusses some of the design considerations and analyses governing these components.

Flow and pressure-drop equations fo r  sizing valves. Determining the flow area of a valve from the given flow-rate and pressure-drop data employs equations that contain empirical coefficients. These coefficients are established from test data on the specific type of valve and are specified by various methods. Several of these equations, each containing a unique empirical coefficient, are described in this section. The equations not only provide a basis for computing the required valve flow-area, but also a ready reference for converting from one method of specifying the valve size (flow capacity) to another. Table 7-2 gives nomenclature and units used in this section.

Incompressible-fluid-flow equations are used for fluids having relatively constant density with respect to operating pressure. At moderate pressures, most liquids can be considered incompressible fluids.

The orifice coefficient C together with the in compressible orifice equation defines the flow capac ity of valves as well as orifices ("A" is the orifice flow area or valve minimum-flow area, which usually oc curs at the seat), as follows:

CA w =-~-~-[2go (P1 - P2)]1/2 (7-33)

For orifices, the flow coefficient C is a function of various parameters, including the following:

 The Reynolds number, a dimensionless quan t iWoa function of line size, fluid velocity, and viscosity. An equation for the Reynolds num ber appears in Table 7-3.

 The ratio of the line inside diameter to the orifice diameter.

 The geometry of the orifice; i.e., whether or not the orifice has a sharp (or rounded) inlet and the relative length of the orifice.

A large collection of empirical data on orifice coefficients that include the effects of the above pa rameters will be found in Ref. 7-9.

Use of the incompressible orifice equation for valves is commonplace. Specific values for C are in fluenced by many of the same parameters that apply to straight orifice flow. However, valves usually have flow paths that are much more complex than orifices, often involving many changes in flow areas and flow direction throughout the valve flow-path. As a result, valve C values can be accurately defined only from flow test-data. Each valve type has its own character istic value for C. Additionally, within each valve type other factors may cause a variance in C values. For example, consider a pilot valve that has not been de signed to minimize pressure drop and has a C of 0.4. On detailed examination of the valve flow-path, one might find that all of the flow areas come close to the value of the minimum-flow area, which occurs at the seat. For this reason, all of the flow velocities within the device will be high, contributing to high differen tial pressure and thus a low value for C.

The range of orifice coefficients for valves can vary from less than 0.4 for small pilot valves, with



236  DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES many sharp edges and changes in flow direction, to values higher than 2.0 for ball valves with a smooth flow path and with a minimum-flow area that is the same as the inlet and outlet lines. Conversely, a ball valve (which ideally has a large value of C) can also have a much lower value if the minimum-flow area through the valve is much smaller than the inlet- or exit-line diameters, which will incur expansion and contraction losses.

There are two common methods of using the ori fice coefficient and flow equation to specify valve size:

 Effective area Ae, the product of the orifice co efficient and the minimum-flow area for the valve, Ae = CA.

 Equiva lent  s h a r p - e d g e d  orifice d i a m e t e r
(ESEOD). This diameter can be used in the orifice-flow equation as effective area when converted to area and multiplied by a speci fied orifice coefficient (usually 0.65), as follows:

A e - CA = ~- ESEOD 2 x 0.65

The empirical pressure-loss coefficient KI accounts for pressure losses in contractions, expansions, and bends in the flow path. Specific values for many cases can be found in Ref. 7-9. This coefficient is also used to characterize valve flow-capacity, based on the flow area of the upstream line. The relationship be tween K1 and the flow rate i sN

By equating Eq. (7-33) and (7-34) the effective area can be found:

Ae = C A  A1

Another factor useful in measuring and analyzing pressure loss, resistance r, helps most in analyzing a system where resistances can be added algebraically in much the same way as they are added in an elec trical circuit. The fluid-resistance analogy, however , requires flow as a squared function, replacing the lin ear current in the electrical circuit. The defining equation i sm w -- [o(P1 -- P2)] 1/2
r (7-35)

By equating Eq. (7-33) and (7-35), the effective area can be computed from a given resistance value, as follows:

A common industrial practice relates valve flow ca pacity to water flow at a specific differential pressure.

The Cv value becomes the number of gallons of water per minute that a valve will flow with a differential pressure of 1.0 psi. A useful form of this equation re lates Cv to flow capacity for any fluid with known density:

Cv w =  ~ [r (P1 - P2)]

1/2
(7-36)

Equating Eq. (7-33) and (7-36) yields the effective area:

Cv Ae = CA - 38

Many of the same equations used for incompressible flow analysis can be used for compressible flow if the pressure drop will be less than 10% of upstream pres sure. More accurate results can be obtained by using the compressible-fluid equations that are applicable over the complete range of operating pressures and pressure drops.

The flow coefficient for nozzles depends on nozzle geometry and the ratio of line to nozzle diameters
(as detailed in Ref. 7-9). Applying this equation to sharp-edged orifices yields a flow coefficient that is nearly constant with respect to pressure ratio P2/P1. However,  this same equation, applied to nozzles, yields a flow coefficient that depends on pressure ra tio (Fig. 7-19).

The average-density orifice equation is derived from the incompressible orifice [Eq. (7-33)] and the average gas density, based on upstream and down stream pressures at constant temperature, assuming

This flow equation is frequently used for sizing valves, where the flow coefficient is based on experience with similar flow devices.

Leakage flow equations. Leakage flow equations are essential tools for the design of fluid control components.  An understanding of these equations permits the prediction of propellant leak age, based on test results with referee fluids. For example, it is not practical or economical to perform component leakage tests with a cryogenic fluid, such as liquid oxygen, because of associated hazards and the difficulty of handling and measuring leakage from a fluid that changes phase from liquid to gas. In addi tion to leakage correlation of one fluid to another, these equations make possible the estimation of leakage from known leak-path surface geometry, such as might exist between the poppet and seat of a valve. The following discussion has been extracted from Ref. 7-10.

Leakage of fluids can occur through one or more of the following mechanisms: permeation, molecular flow, transition flow, laminar flow, turbulent flow, and nozzle flow. Each of these mechanisms will be dis cussed in following paragraphs. Equations and boundary conditions are summarized in Tables 7-3

and 7-4. These equations are derived for a circular hole of diameter d and a parallel plate leak-path model of width W and gap hp, with pressure drop over length L for each path.

Permeation, turbulent flow, and nozzle flow are proportional to the flow area; thus, circular or other flow paths can be substituted. The hydraulic diame ter d is used to determine the applicable Reynolds number and friction factor. However, molecular flow and laminar flow are integrated equations, involving the path geometry. The noted constants will therefore differ as shown in the tables.

Permeation flow occurs by a process of gas ab sorption on a surface film, diffusion through the bulk, and desorption on the low-pressure side. It usually takes large surface areas and organic materials to produce significant leakage. Natural rubber, a typical example of material with high permeability, will be easily penetrated by helium and water vapor. Metals are not permeable to the rare gases, although hydro gen gas can diffuse into most metals, often causing loss of metal strength. Unless in the mass spectrome ter range (<10-5 scim or 10 -2 scc/hr), permeation leakage is usually insignificant. Note, however, that other modes of flow can occur through physical openings in the permeable material in the same or opposite direction as the permeation leakage. Con sequently, it is difficult in the low-leakage range to differentiate between leak modes.

Molecular flow occurs when gas pressure is suffi ciently low and/or the leak path is small enough that gas molecules encounter the walls more frequently than other gas molecules. This type of flow results when the mean-free path Lm exceeds the leakage gap hp, a condition defined by the Knudsen number as follows:

Lm KN = -K-- > 1.0 ,,p

Molecular flow results from a greater concentration of molecules on one side of a barrier than on the other. The driving force for flow is therefore the par tial-pressure differential existing across a given leak path. As an example, with 1.0-atm helium pressure on one side of an opening at 1.0 atm and a like pres sure of nitrogen on the other side, there would be a molecular-flow transfer of each gas in opposite direc tions across the same leak path.

A small mean-free-path of the molecule with re spect to the distance between walls induces laminar flow governed by bulk fluid properties, primarily vis cosity. The Knudsen number for the lower boundary of laminar flow is KN < 0.01. In this case, the channel is full, and flow prevails only from higher to lower pressure.

Between laminar and molecular flow, a transition region combines molecular- and laminar-flow char acteristics. The easiest treatment simply adds the two types of flow or, if sufficiently high flow exists, ignores the molecular component (and vice versa). In lami nar flow, the viscous forces between the fluid particles



C O N T R O L  AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 239

govern the stream lines, resulting in a predictable ve locity profile from zero velocity at the boundary to a maximum velocity between boundaries. This velocity profile is termed parabolic because it follows a sec ond-degree curve (parabola). As the flow velocity is increased, the inertial forces between fluid particles become greater than the viscous forces, and a transi tion to turbulent flow begins. The defining parameter is the Reynolds number, the ratio of inertial to vis cous forces:

9 V d Re =

1728 m g

Tests of valve seats show gaseous laminar flow to exist for Reynolds numbers less than 500. Flow velocities are usually low enough to assume infinite heat trans fer or isothermal flow. For Reynolds numbers ap proaching 500, gas-exit velocities become very high because of expansion and reduced density, and the isothermal assumption is not valid (although the re suits may be sufficiently accurate for most analyses). Published data indicate that liquid laminar flow pre vails with Reynolds numbers up to 2000.

In the turbulent flow regime, laminar flow exists only in a narrow boundary near the walls. The veloc ity profile is nearly fiat, and the flow characteristics are defined by both theoretical and empirical infor mation. Basically, pressure drop is a function of in ternal and surface fluid friction over the length of the flow path. Under some conditions of incompressible flow, entrance and exit losses can exceed the friction loss, and these factors must  be considered in comput ing  the leakage flow. For gas flows, thermodynamic considerations are employed to de fine fluid conditions, and the flow is considered to be adiabatic; i.e., there is no heat transfer. Consequently, temperature will decrease as the gas expands to an exit pressure. The exit pressure will either be greater than the ambient for sonic flow or equal to the am bient for subsonic flow.

Nozzle flow occurs as the flow path is shortened, friction losses become negligible, and flow-pressure drop is expended in a turbulent jet. In this case, the flow rate is governed by the velocity head and an empirically defined flow-coefficient that is largely a function of the entrance geometry and length of path to gap ratio.

Compressibility effects exist in most modes of gas-leakage flow. The most significantly affected re gions are the turbulent and nozzle-flow regimes. With constant-area leak paths, the exit velocity will be lim ited by a phenomenon known as "choking." This condition results when the exit velocity equals the acoustic velocity. Mach number, a measure of com pressibility effects, and an important parameter  in gas dynamics, is defined as the ratio of the average fluid velocity V to the speed of sound a at the same conditions: M -- V/a.

Compressibility effects can usually be neglected with a Mach number less than about 0.4, correspond ing to a pressure drop less than 10% of the upstream pressure. This case will seldom be seen with seal leakage because the supply pressure is usually several times greater than the ambient or downstream back pressure.

Control-fluid p r e s s u r e  leve l  The operating pressure of fluids has a major effect on the design of fluid-control components .  For example, actuating forces required to control the component  are af fected by operating pressure on any unbalanced pressure areas. Additionally, seal friction loads will be higher at high operating pressures as a result of the increased contact load.

The magnitude of operating pressure influences the design of seats and seals. Elastomeric and plastic seals, for example, must be contained to prevent ex trusion at high pressures.

Structural loads resulting from high pressure must be considered in selecting materials to meet stress requirements. Although more subtle, deflection re sulting from high pressure, or from assembly loads required to contain the high pressure, must be con sidered in selection of clearances of precision de vices, such as bearings. Deflections (which degrade surface geometry) may affect performance of such items as static seals and valve seats.

Under certain circumstances,  combinations of pressure and temperature can cause deleterious ef fects on material properties. More detail on this sub ject can be found in the section on "Design of Dynamic Seals for Fluid-Control Components."

Special system operating provisions are often made to meet the stringent requirements in high pressure applications. For example, the cutoff events in a high-pressure, turbopump-fed engine system may be sequenced so that turbine power is cut first; thus the main propellant valves will not be required to shut off against the mainstage high discharge pres sures.

Fluid-flow velocity. Problems associated with high-velocity fluid flow in control components  in clude generation of acoustic resonances, unforeseen loads resulting from differences between stagnation pressure and static pressure, and direct impingement of high-velocity flow on devices sensitive to side loads.

Components and lines that have a disruption in the flow path and a geometrical configuration that causes the fluid and the disruption to interact have developed acoustic resonance. The resultant local mechanical  vibration and acceleration can cause hardware damage.

In components having a high-velocity fluid--i.e., the stagnation and static pressures are very differ ent---caution must be taken to prevent these pressure differences from distorting or loosening hardware exposed to the high-velocity flow stream.

Fluid-flow temperature. Fluid temperature plays a major role in the selection of basic design concepts  for seals and for material  selection. Materials with similar coefficients of thermal expan sion provide the best combinat ion for extreme temperature service. Additionally, the design should consider differential tempera tures  from point to point in the component  to avoid excessive distor tion, compression,  or tension in critical parts. Differential temperatures can be expected to occur during transients, when, for example, the interior of a component  is first exposed to a cryogenic propellant

In designing components,  other considerations for temperature include selection of materials for ductility and strength (cryogenic temperatures usually lower ductility and increase strength, while high tem peratures have the opposite effect).

Some pneumatic components require pressuriza tion and venting rates to be maintained to meet cer tain engine-sequencing requirements. Changes in gas temperature will affect these rates. The system either should have heaters on the actuators to maintain gas temperature constant or should use thermally-com pensated orifices to correct changes in temperature.

Dynamic cons idera t i ons  in f lu id - f l ow  con t ro l  components .  Dynamic analysis of fluid-flow control components often requires development  of computer  models. The control component  to be simulated can usually be represented mathematically by a set of nonlinear differential equations. The equations can then be solved by using numerical integration techniques on a digital computer. These computer models are extremely useful in predicting and explaining component  dynamic and static be havior as well as in defining performance and operation boundaries.

Transient factors, such as dynamic response, sta bility, pressure surge, flow noise, and induced vibra tion, are important design considerations in any fluid-flow control component .  To obtain reliable control performance at high-fluid-flow velocities, the components must be designed to withstand the im pact loading imposed upon the control surfaces by the fluid stream and also the impact force inflicted on the seat by the poppet.

The following example illustrates the use of a computer model to simulate transient characteristics of a control valve. Figure 7-20 illustrates the schemat ic of a bipropellant control valve. In this concept, the main valves are designed to have a differential area piston, controlled by a three-way pilot solenoid valve (normally open). This valve alternately pressur izes and vents the control side of the piston for opening or closing. Basic equations appear below for the pilot valve and one of the main valves. Nomenclature  other  than that def ined by the schematic may be found in Table 7-2.

Design  o f  Dynamic  Seals for Fluid-Control C o m p o n e n t s

Apart from static seals, which will be treated in Chapter 9, two basic types of seals are required for fluid-flow-control components: seals for moving (re ciprocating and rotating) cylindrical elements, such as actuator pistons, shafts, and rods (referred to as dynamic seals), and seals for valve seats (seating closures).

Temperature is one of the most important con siderations in the design of seals. Seals can be classi fied into those for medium-temperature service (-65
to 400F), low-temperature service (-423 to 400"F), and high-temperature service (over 400"F). The selection of the configurations and the materials for these seals is based to a large extent on service conditions and the type of fluid involved. Generally, soft nonmetal lic or elastomeric seals are used wherever possible. The outstanding advantage of these seals is that they function satisfactorily despite minor imperfections in the seal or the mating part.

Dynamic seals f o r  medium-temperature services.  Medium-temperature-service dynamic seals, successfully used on liquid-propellant rocket engine valves (Fig. 7-23), include O-ring packings with and without backup rings or slipper seals (Fig. 7-23a, b, and c). Plain elastomeric O-rings have been used as dynamic seals for both hydraulic and pneumatic service. For applications where the differential pressure across the seals exceeds 1500 psi, backup rings have normally been used to prevent extrusion of the O-ring between the shaft and bore.

Some applications need a plastic slipper seal in conjunction with an O-ring. As an example, a valve in which the friction accompanies an O-ring may not satisfy repeatability requirements. The plastic slipper seal, usually a Teflon-based material, then provides a nearly constant, repeatable coefficient of friction, permitting better repeatability. The slipper seal can also be useful when the available elastomers, compat

The use of a slipper seal then lets the O-ring act as a static seal, while the slipper seal makes the true dynamic seal.

Dynamic seals f o r  low-temperature service. Lip seals (Fig. 7-23d) can be used effectively as recip rocating and rotary shaft seals and as reciprocating piston seals in propellant valves for temperatures as low as -42YF and pressures up to 2000 psi. They are used to seal pressurants, such as helium and nitrogen, and propellants, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (and RP-1 at medium temperatures). The de sign creates differential pressure to increase contact stress between the seal and the moving surface. This pressure enhances the contact stress already present from hoop tension in the seals. The thin sheet mate rial used in this design furnishes the flexibility re quired for cryogenic operation. Mylar is the material of choice for this seal design, although KEL-F has also been used, if proven adequate in seal-fluid com patibility testing.



242 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

The triangle seal (Fig. 7-23e) serves the same ap plications as the Mylar lip seal, but at the operating differential pressures extending to over 8000 psi. This design is rugged and simple. Precise machining of the seal geometry permits analysis of loads re quired to close the gap between the seal and the mat ing surfaces, permits estimation of contact stress and load, and provides a means of estimating friction load from known friction coefficients. Propellant seals at high pressure use polyimide material, such as DuPont Vespel SP-211, which contains Teflon to re duce friction. Other applications, notably in lower pressure service to approximately 1000 psid, use vir gin or graphite-filled TFE Teflon, or Vespel SP-211. The wave-washer springs force the loader ring against the seal at an angle of 45 deg, which provides equal axial and radial load. Additionally, the seal contact stress and load increase with differential pressure. A major benefit of this design is the degree of lateral motion that the seal can withstand, by virtue of its ability to slide sideways, without detrimental effect on leakage or on seal stress. The lip seal, by compari son, requires hoop deflection of the seal material to accept compliance for lateral motion.

Hydroformed metal bellows (Fig. 7-23f) are used extensively as reciprocating piston and shaft seals on rocket-engine valves in applications which demand essentially zero propellant or pressurant leakage. In addition to the sealing ability, the bellows can also provide spring force to bias valve poppets to a speci fied position. Bellows can have either single- or mul tiple-ply construction. Multiple-ply construction can increase hoop strength of the bellows without the large increases in spring rate that shown by a single ply of equivalent thickness. Bellows are typically hy droformed in dies. After forming, the plies are welded together at the ends to form a solid mass for the final machining to length and for welding to the mating shaft or piston and housing. Disadvantages of bellows include high cost of the fabrication pro cess, high spring rates, which may require additional control load to operate the component,  and rela tively large envelopes, which increase the size and weight of the component.

Dynamic seals f o r  high-temperature service. Precision metal piston rings (Fig. 7-23g) are used for sealing gas at high temperatures. A typical applica tion might have a Stellite piston ring in a nitrided stainless-steel-bore. Piston rings are simple and ef fective for sealing hot gas without incurring large fric tion loads. However, they allow significant leakage. As a consequence, propellants mus t  be positively separated from each other or from the atmosphere by multiple seals with vent or drain ports between the seals.

A bellows and metallic-face-seal assembly (Fig. 7 23h) can also be used for high-temperature rotary shaft sealing. Limits on operating temperature are imposed by the allowable stress and fatigue life of the bellows material at the operating temperature. This type of seal has been used in gate valves at tempera tures up to 1400"F and pressures up to 1150 psi. The illustrated seat consists of a flame-sprayed tungsten carbide surface on the shaft in contact with a Rene-41
ring.

Sealing specifications. Design requirements on leakage often dictate the seal design. For this reason, it is beneficial to have an extensive knowl edge of seal capabilities. The use of inert gas for leak testing usually can circumvent the impracticalities of testing with propellants, because leakage thus mea sured can be analytically converted to equivalent propellant leakage.

Figure 7-24 shows typical helium-leakage for the various seal designs (maximum allowable over the range of pressure and temperature). Lower values can be achieved, but at higher cost, owing to the need to provide better hardware-geometry control and to the expected higher initial rejection rates.

Design of  Seating Closures for Fluid Control Components

Seating closures used on rocket-engine control com ponents (Fig. 7-24) include seals for propellant, pres surant, and hydraulic systems for a wide variety of operating pressures and temperatures.

Seating closures f o r  medium-temperature service. The trapped-O-ring seat (Fig. 7-24a) is used extensively in poppet valves for medium-temperature service with gases, such as helium and nitrogen. The design employs a two-piece poppet  to facilitate groove machining and to permit seal installation. Dimensions of the seal groove are selected to retain the O-ring firmly and to provide a protrusion of ma terial that seats against a mating metal corner. This seal is used at differential pressures up to 4500 psi at
160"F with a 90-Shore-hardness O-ring. This seal de sign is also used for dual seating, where two seals on the same poppet  must seat simultaneously, at differ ential pressures up to 1000 psi and temperatures of
165"F with 70-Shore-hardness O-rings. Design re quirements for this seal include making certain that, to prevent blowing the seal from the groove, gas trapped between the groove and the O-ring will have been vented before applying pressure.

The bonded elastomeric seal (Fig. 7-24b) is used on certain fuel valves and pneumatic-service-control poppet valves. Leaktight to liquids, it seals less than 5
scim using helium. The bonding process used to fab ricate this seal must be closely controlled, because it does not allow normal inspection, as in the case of the trapped O-ring seal. The design permits a one piece poppet  because it needs no separate retainers to hold the seal in place. Design considerations in clude limiting the volume of the seal protrusion above the metal-stop surface to the volume of the open section of the seal below the stop-surface cavity in order to prevent bulk compression and to ensure stopping on the metal stop.

Seating c losures  f o r  low- temperature service. The plastic-disc seal (Fig. 7-24c) is but one of many configurations used in poppet  valves. The primary characteristic of this seal is that it is retained mechanically, as opposed to being molded in place, and is machined from plate or bar-stock plastic, usu ally KeI-F. The seal does not provide the ability to conform to the mating surfaces as well as elastomer seats do; but its operating temperature extends t o  423"F. Additionally, because of material compatibili

Fig. 7-24 Seating c losures  used  in f luid-control  c o m p o n e n t s . ties, the use of plastic for sealing permits service with a much wider range of propellants than elastomers have. For example, use of plastics, such as TFE Teflon, will make this design suitable for use with such exotic propellants as nitrogen tetroxide and fluori nated oxidizers. Design details that must be consid ered include the use of a positive stop to limit the amount of deflection imposed on the plastic. In es timating poppet  stroke, material creep should be taken into account.

The floating seal (Fig. 7-24d) is used in certain poppet  check-valve designs to good advantage. With a design permitting the seal (usually Teflon) to float, the seal can seek the proper geometry to achieve clo sure. The seal also acts as the positive stop that keeps impact-loading away from metal parts, which other wise might create detrimental wear. Although offer ing the self-centering feature, this design must reseal on two faces at the end of each open-and-close cycle
(whereas a more conventional seal design, retained in the poppet, has to reseat only on one face).

Flat metal-to-metal seating (Fig. 7-24e) is used ex tensively in small control valves where the effective unbalanced pressure area must be precisely con trolled. Metal-to-metal seating is also used in corn ponents requiring service in extreme temperatures, either high or low, and with fluids not compatible with soft materials. Typical materials include tung sten carbide poppets and 440"C seats. A bumper land outside of, and slightly below, the seating land can often eliminate damage to the seating land that might result from impact of the poppet on the seat ing-land corner when it is not closing in true parallel fashion. Surface finishes as low as 0.1 ~tin. AA can be achieved with flat seats that allow practical fabri cation with low leakage. Operating pressures for the metal-to-metal seat are virtually unlimited, if surface areas can limit contact stress be low the yield strength. The design must take into consideration the problem of particulate contamination, which can damage the seat and cause excessive leakage. For this reason, metal-to-metal flat seats should be used only with clean fluids or with filters.

The cutter seat (Fig. 7-24f), a specialized ar rangement,  resists particulate contamination and keeps leakage very low. Both the poppet and the seat are tungsten carbide for extreme hardness. The seat lands are purposely kept narrow to reduce the chance of trapping a particle of contamination and to cut through particles if they do become trapped. The



244 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES narrow seating land also provides very accurate con trol of effective pressure area. This design is used in pneumatic service for operation at-200"F. Design considerations for this seat include sensitivity to im pact damage due to the use of low-ductility materials.

The bellows-loaded ball seal (Fig. 7-24g) serves ball valves, usually employing Kel-F to gain a degree of compliance with the macrogeometry of the ball surface. The seal seats on one end in a retainer welded to a metal hydroformed bellows. The oppo site end of the bellows is welded to another retainer, which is bolted in place to the valve housing and sealed by a static seal. The bellows permits the seal to seek the ball seating surface as the ball moves lat erally through clearances, and also permits a degree of compliance because of ball misalignment axially in the housing. This seal design is used at differential pressures up to 1500 psi and at temperatures as low as
-423"F. Careful selection of contact points between the seal and the retainer and the seal and the ball, with regard to the mean-effective area of the bellows, must be observed to establish proper seating. As a disadvantage of this method, hydroformed metal bel lows are usually costly and require a lengthy lead time to procure.

A lip seal (Fig. 7-24h), similar to the dynamic seal discussed previously, typically seals butterfly valves for liquid-propellant engines, but will be one-piece Kel-F and usually much thicker than the shaft-seal de signs. The additional thickness provides mechanical stiffness needed to withstand high-velocity liquid flow and the resultant differential pressure. Retainers and bolts clamp the seals to the body to effect a gasket type static seal with the housing. Invar washers are sometimes used to provide thermal compensation, which aids in maintaining a constant gasket load as the temperature of the bolts, seal, and housing de creases to that of the propellant (as low as -423"F for liquid hydrogen). This seal design has limited differ ential operating pressure. Making the seal thick enough to handle high differential operating pres sures would reduce its flexibility to the point that the compliance could not guarantee a good seal.

The flexible-disc seal (Fig. 7-24i) represents the low-temperature equivalent for the compliant elas tomeric seal of Fig. 7-24a. This seal permits dual seat ing on a common shaft. It has deflections on the or der of 0.001 to 0.002 in. and operating pressures un der 1000 psi (owing to the hertz contact stress be tween the flexible disc and the seat). This seal can be used at temperatures down to -423"F.

Seating closures f o r  high-temperature service. The metal-to-metal seat and the cutter seat
(Fig. 7-24e and f) both offer satisfactory high-tem perature service. Additionally, the flexure-disc seal
(Fig. 7-24i), within the limits of material properties for flexure stress and hertz contact stress, also gives suitable high-temperature service.

Sealing specifications. As in the case for dynamic seals, here design must often be selected to fulfill seal-leakage requirements. For this reason, the designer needs extensive knowledge of seal capa bilities. In most cases, use of inert gas for leak testing will circumvent the impracticalities of testing with propellants, because leakage thus measured can be analytically converted to equivalent propel lant leakage.

Figure 7-24 shows typical helium leakage
(maximum allowable over the range of pressure and temperature) for the various seal designs. Lower val ues increase cost, owing to the need to provide better hardware-geometry control and expected higher ini tial rejection-rates.

Design of Propellant Valves

Propellant valves control flow of propellants to main thrust chambers and gas generators or preburners. Other functions include control of bleed flow, spark igniter flow, and various thermal conditionings. Although usually two-position (open/closed),  nor mally-closed valves, to meet specific sequencing re quirements, designs may include an intermediate opening position. For thrust- or mixture-control purposes, a continuously-variable opening position may be required on some propellant systems.

In addition to propellant compatibility and struc tural integrity, prime design considerations for pro pellant valves include the following objectives:

 No leakage of propellant through the valve when closed (see previous section on leakage flows for considerations to minimize potential leakage).

 Proper actuating time during opening and closing in accordance with the requirements of the control system.

 Minimum pressure-drop.
 Meet fail-safe and/or  fail-operational system requirements. Among the great variety of propellant valve types available, each has certain characteristics that make it suitable for a specific application. Frequently used propellant valves can be classified according to their design configurations: butterfly, ball, poppet, venturi, and gate.

Butterfly-type propel lant  valves. One of the most widely used types used in large liquid propellant rocket engines, the butterfly valve has established a reliable operational record in LO2/RP-1, LO2/LH2, storable, and other liquid-propellant ser vices. Existing butterfly-valve designs range from 2.0 to 17.0-in. nominal diameter, for use at propellant pressures from 20 to over 1500 psia.

Figure 7-25 presents a typical butterfly-valve de sign. In it, a lip seal engages a spherical surface on the valve gate, similar to the one in Fig. 7-24h. The valve gate pivots on the valve shaft, the axis of which passes through the geometric center of the spherical sealing surface. In most designs, the valve gate ro tates 90 deg from the closed to the fully opened posi tion. The valve is operated by a piston-type actuator, through a connecting link and shaft crank arm. Lip seals make dynamic closure with the rotating valve shaft (Fig. 7-24d). Noncryogenic-propellant pressure, an inert gas supply, or hydraulic system pressure con trolled by a pilot valve supplies the actuating power.

The valve in Fig. 7-25 is designed to be normally closed by a spring installed on the closing side of the actuator piston. Except for shaft, gate, link, lever, and

Butterfly valves have relatively low resistance to fluid flow. They are compact, light, and easy to ser vice. And they have a high characteristic area, which can be expressed as- 7 1 "

A* = ~-ds 2 - Ag (7-39)

where  (see Fig. 7-25 for dimension references) A =
characteristic area of the valve, in.2; d s = inside di ameter  of the valve seat lip-seal, in.; and Ag = pro jected valve gate area at fully open  position, in.2. Values for A range from 65% of the duct area on a 2 in. valve to about  87% of the duct area on a 12 in.valve. A butterfly valve maintains a relatively smooth fluid-flow stream over a wide range of valve gate angular positions. Thus, when used as a throttle valve, it has little tendency toward turbulence and its a t tendant  adverse effects, such as local propellant cavitation.

When RP-1 is used as the actuating fluid for the LOX valve a heater may be required at the actuator to keep the fuel from freezing. The actuator and valve arrangement of the butterfly valve (Fig. 7-25) may be des igned  for no rma l ly -open  or normal ly-closed operat ion,  and posit ion indicators may be added. Figure 7-27 illustrates the linkage between the main oxidizer valve and the igniter-fuel-sequence valve of the A-1 Stage engine.

Ball-type propel lant  valves. A ball valve offers low pressure drop, since it permits in-line, unrestricted fluid flow, if it has the same flow area as the connecting lines. As an additional benefit, ball valve's spherical sealing surface can readily be fabricated with precise geometry. Ball valves have a reliable record in cryogenic and in some storable propellant control applications for the main thrust chamber and for high-capacity gas generators.

Ball valves have actuating-torque characteristics similar to those of butterfly valves. A fluid-dynamic torque acts in a direction to close the valve, increases as the valve is opened until reaching a maximum torque value between 60 and 80 deg open, and then decreases rapidly to zero as the full, 90-deg open po sition is reached. This 90 deg of rotation for opening necessitates an actuator with relatively long stroke.

The SSME main LOX valve (Fig. 7-29) presents an example of a successful application. It has a 2.38-in. diam propellant-flow passage. Flange-mounted be tween the main-thrust-chamber LOX dome and the high-pressure oxidizer duct, the valve controls oxi dizer flow to the main-chamber LOX dome and main-chamber augmented-spark igniter. A hydraulic servoactuator, mounted to the valve housing, oper ates the valve. Operating pressure is 4600 psi and the flow rate is 853 lb/s. (Preburner ball valves on this engine operate at pressures as high as 8800 psi and LOX flow rates up to 83 lb/s.)

The valve has two major components,  the inte gral bal l /shaft /cams and the ball-seal retracting mechanism. The ball seal is a machined plastic, bel lows-loaded design. Redundant shaft seals with an overboard drain between them prevent leakage along the shaft (actuator end) during engine operation. Inlet/outlet throttling sleeves align the flow to mini mize turbulence and the resultant pressure loss. Ball seal wear is minimized by cams and a cam-follower assembly that displaces the seal away from contact with the ball (after the initial few degrees of ball travel when it is being opened).

Poppet - type  prope l lant  valves. Poppet valves offer relative simplicity, primarily because of the reciprocating operation which permits the direct, in:line connect ion of an actuator. However,  this arrangement requires turning the flow inside the passage, with consequent  relatively high pressure drops. Poppet valves prove satisfactory when precise throttling control is not required and when tight shutoff may be required. Throttling of poppet valves, without sophisticated contouring of some sort of plug within the flow path, results in poor  control as a consequence of the high area gain when the poppet is near the seat.

Figure 7-30 presents the design of the main pro pellant-control poppet- type valve of a Saturn first stage F-1 engine. The F-1 engine contains two LOX valves and two fuel valves of similar design. The dis played valve has a seat diameter of 8 in. and a 2.34 in. stroke. These valves are hydraulically actuated to either of two positions, open or closed. A pressure balancing chamber reduces the unbalanced hydrody namic forces and thus the size of the actuator. The re lationship between the dynamic-seal and seat-seal di ameters, in conjunction with the propellant pressure, produces sufficient unbalanced force that, even with the loss of actuator control pressure, the valve would still retain the fully-open position. A small sequence valve mechanically attached to the main valve actua tor mechanical ly sequences it with other engine components. This type of poppet valve is suitable for high-flow and high-pressure cryogenic and storable propellant services.

Venturi-type propellant valves. Figure 7-31
shows a typical design for a venturi-type propellant valve. In certain installations, for various reasons, it may be desirable to use a valve of a nominal size, smaller than that ~f the main duct. A valve installed in the throat of a venturi offers a possible solution. The smooth contours of the venturi limit pressure drop penalties to a few psi. With adjacent ducting permitting, it is conceivable that the venturi may simultaneously be used for flow measurements.

The venturi may be designed to operate as a cav itating venturi. Based on Bernoulli's energy equation, the minimum pressure of a liquid is made to fall be low its vapor pressure. As a result, a gaseous region forms at the throat. If this gas moves through the throat at the velocity of sound, downstream pressure variations and disturbances cannot advance beyond the throat. Up to minimum pressure differentials across the venturi (for example,  20% of upstream pressure), the flow rate will then depend on upstream pressure only. When used as a throttling device, the cavitating venturi affords smaller pressure drops, be cause the gaseous characteristics at the throat pro duce a near-linear relationship between flow rate and supply pressure, rather than following a square law. The fluid-flow venturi valves have been applied suc cessfully in cryogenic and storable-propellant units.

In fluid-flow systems that require flow limitation and a shutoff control valve as well, the venturi valve with a cavitating diffuser will provide both, at a weight of only the valve and at a pressure drop of only the venturi.

Venturi valves occupy a relatively long space in the direction of flow, between four to six times the line nominal diameter. This length imposes limita tions on size and application in engine systems. However, venturi valves up to 10-in. nominal diame ter have been successfully built for rocket systems.

The venturi-type propellant valve of Fig. 7-31 was d e s i g n e d  and  m a n u f a c t u r e d  by Fox Valve Development Co. A pilot-operated shutoff valve, it has a venturi section with a spring-loaded poppet seated at the throat. Propellant line pressure, con trolled by a solenoid pilot valve, actuates the valve, open or closed. As shown in the schematic, the nor mally-closed pilot valve is inserted in a passageway that interconnects the poppet  cavity and an opening in the venturi throat. Normally, upstream propellant pressure fills the poppet  cavity and provides addi tional seating force on the poppet  in the same direc tion as the valve spring to ensure valve closure. When the pilot valve is energized to open, propellant pres sure behind the valve poppet  is vented out at a greater rate than it can be replaced by leakage



248 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES through the poppet  clearance area. This condition reduces pressure and thus overcomes the valve spring and causes the main valve poppet to open. Because the valve body is not pierced by a shaft or actuator rod and there are no dynamic seals, no pathways exist for leakage to ambient. The small number of moving parts further enhances the relia bility of venturi valves.

Gate-type propel lant  valves. Figure 7-32
displays a typical design of a propellant gate valve. Its unrestricted fluid flow, resulting in low-pressure drop, is a major advantage. It also provides a relatively short distance between the valve inlet and outlet in the direction of the flow. This design uses elastomer O-rings as the valve-seat seal; these are suitable only for medium-tempera ture  services. Cryogenic application requires other seal types. Gate valves are designed for propellant line pressures up to 3000 psi. Because of relative bulkiness, gate valves are limited to low-propellant-flow applications, in cluding gas-generator control and ground-support services.

Design of Control Pilot Valves

A pilot valve controls a fluid, which in turn controls or actuates other fluid-flow-control components, such as propellant valves, or controls engine-sequence events, such as the admission of igniter fuel. A great variety of control pilot valves serves liquid-propel lant rocket engines. Basically, they can be grouped into two categories, on-off and proportional (servo). This discussion concerns only the on-off type. Since the proportional-type pilot valves are used widely in closed-loop control systems, they will be treated as regulating devices and thus discussed in another sec tion.

A pilot valve may be operated electrically or by fluid pressure or through a mechanical connection with other control components.  Requirements for fast response,  minimal leakage of control fluid through the valve when closed, and actuating power source compatible with systems design--all receive close attention in the design of pilot valves.

The most frequently used on-off pilot valves may be classified according to design configuration into the two-way, three-way, or four-way Wpe.

Two-way-type pilot  valves. The term two way refers to the number of ports. A two-way pilot valve is basically a two-port, open-close-type shutoff valve. The sequence valves shown in Fig. 7-27 and 7 31 are typical examples of two-way-type pilot valves. Both kinds use mechanical actuation from the main propellant valves. Solenoid or fluid-pressure-oper ated two-way pilot valves are also used frequently.

Three-way- type  p i l o t  valves. A three-way pilot valve (Fig. 7-33) has three ports: the inlet or pressure port, the outlet or cylinder (actuator) port, and the vent or return port. If the valve is designed normally closed (NC), the fluid path between inlet and outlet ports will be closed when no actuator power is applied, while the path is open between outlet and vent ports. Actuation of the valve closes one fluid path and opens the other. The reverse is true for a normally open (NO) valve; i.e., the fluid path between the inlet and outlet ports is normally open.

The design illustrated in Fig. 7-33 contains a hard metal-to-metal seat, restrained from radial motion during vibration by a flexure disc, which also serves as a spring to open the valve at low inlet pressures. Metal seating permits precise analysis of the unbal anced seating area and results in the minimum-size actuator. The poppet is made of a fine-grain tungsten carbide, and the seats are hardened 440C stainless steel. Filters are built into the inlet and outlet ports to protect the seats from particulate contamination. The valve is held closed against the inlet pressure by a spring that acts through the armature and the pushrod. Both armature and pushrod have Teflon bushings, which eliminate metal-to-metal sliding mo tion and the resultant need for lubrication. The solenoid is completely potted to restrain lead wires, coil wires, and solder joints during vibration. The solenoid is hermetically sealed by weld joints be tween the case, electrical receptacle, and base and by a glass compression seal within the electrical recep tacle. In the construction of the solenoid magnetic path, 430 stainless steel eliminates need for protec tion from the operating fluid or from the atmo Armature Case Base Filter

Four-way-type p i lo t  valves. A four-way-type pilot valve can replace two three-way valves for control of double-acting (two-directional) actuators. Figure 7-34 presents the basic schematic of a four-way pilot valve. The schematic shows a solenoid actuator;
but mechanical or pressure actuators are also com mon. A four-way valve has two outlet ports, one normally closed and one normally open. The nor mally-open port is connected to the inlet port when the actuator is not energized. Likewise, the normally closed port is connected to the vent. When the actuator is energized and the poppet is moved to a second stop, the outlet ports reverse their function;
i.e., the normally closed port is connected to the inlet and the normally open port is connected to the vent. Figure 7-34 shows a poppet-type four-way valve. Slide and sleeve four-way valves are also common but usually only in hydraulic systems.

Design o f  so lenoid  actuators .  Solenoid actuators are usually applied to the sliding stem of pilot-valve poppets  to give on-off, two-posit ion operation. Solenoids (electromagnets) contain an armature or plunger that moves in a coil of wire. Energizing the coil exerts a magnetic force on the armature, the force's magnitude proportional to the cross-sectional area of the armature, the number of the coil turns, the electric current applied to the coil, and the gap between armature and core. The force of attraction increases as the gap narrows.

Figure 7-33 shows a typical dc solenoid actuator. Its magnetic circuit consists of a stationary core, case, base, and armature. Energizing the coil pulls the ar mature toward the core against a compression spring. The spring pushes the armature back to the normal position when the coil is de-energized.

The following equations are used for preliminary des ign of f lat-faced (p lunger - type)  a rmature solenoids of the type shown in Fig. 7-33.

The numerical value of 0.7 shown in the ampere-turns equation implies that 30% of the ampere-turns devel oped by the coil will be used in the fixed air-gaps and in the magnetic material, leaving the remainder to do the useful work across the variable air-gap G. More precise estimates of the distribution of the am pere-turns used within the magnetic circuit require analysis of all flux paths and are usually accom plished by numerical analysis of all fringing, leakage, and series flux-paths.

Solenoid actuators (particularly if energized for extended periods) must be designed with sufficient heat-transfer radiat ing-and-conducting surfaces to prevent temperature from becoming excessive. To provide the required current, the resistance of the coil should be based on its maximum temperature. Suitable protection, such as weld or braze joints, should be provided to prevent the solenoid from be coming contaminated with operating fluids.

Fast response in solenoids depends on magnetic materials with high resistivity, which reduces the eddy currents that produce flux opposing the direction of intended motion. Additionally, drop-out current may be high if gap G is permitted to go to zero. This problem can be avoided by use of nonmagnetic shims or by undercutting the face of the armature by a small amount  (0.0005-0.0015 in.), leaving only a small surface area to contact the mating face.

250 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Design of  Servovalves

Servovalves, in general, are electrohydraulic devices that will control fluid flow or pressure applied to a load in response to an electrical signal. Valves are staged to fit the horsepower requirements of the ap plication. A single-stage valve may be suitable for low-horsepower needs; two-stage valves are necessary for higher flow rates and pressure. The electrohy draulic interface takes place in the first stage, which incorporates a permanent-magnet  torque motor and either a single-inlet (jet-pipe) or nozzle/flapper hy draulic servovalve.

Nozzle/flapper servovalve. Figure 7-35 shows a nozzle/flapper (first stage) combined with a purely hydraulic second stage. The sliding-spool valve arrangement  displayed supplies the second-stage function of most servovalves for flight and engine control applications. Proportional flow or pressure control is achieved through balance of electro magnetically-produced torque against moments pro duced by linear deflection of springs in the first and second stages.

The torque motor converts electrical input sig nals into mechanical motion of the armature. The magnets, frame, and armature form a magnetic cir cuit. Current applied to the torque motor coils cre ates an additional magnetic  field which, when summed with the permanent field, produces a net torque on the armature. This magnetic torque, in a single-stage valve, is balanced by the motion of the armature, resulting from deflection of the flexure tube; in a two-stage valve, the feedback torque from spool motion is also summed.

Armature motion translates directly into dis placement of the flapper be tween the nozzles and production of hydraulic forces on the spool. The mo tion of the flapper between the two opposed nozzles varies the pressure in the two branches of the hy draulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit constitutes a bridge network with four flow restrictions; two fixed orifices and two variable restrictions are formed by the nozzle/flapper clearances. Motion of the flapper increases restriction at one nozzle and decreases flow area in the other. Motion of the spool results from connecting these pressures to the ends of the spool and balancing the resulting force against the feed back spring.

The spool-and-sleeve valve represents a four-way design, with a pressure, a return, and cylinder 1
(CYL1) port and cylinder 2 (CYL2) port. Although pneumatic-service four-ways have a seat and poppets for positive sealing, hydraulic spool-and-sleeve valves cy, 1 cy,2 \ s

The balance of the torque, created by spool motion with the torques produced by the electromagnetic circuit and angular deflection of the flexure tube, yields a linear relationship between input current and load flow.

Figure 7-36 shows the servovalve used on the SSME hydraulic-actuation system. The torque motor consists of coils, frame, and an armature assembly. Typical values for coil resistance and rated current are 1000 f~ and 8 mA, respectively. The frame as sembly surrounding the coils closes the permanent magnetic circuit of the torque motor. The frame is designed to minimize stray magnetic flux, so that the torque motor will neither react to, nor magnetically influence, other electrical equipment.

The armature assembly- -motor  armature, flap per, feedback spring, and flexure-tube support-- is mass-balanced to provide minimum susceptibility to shock and vibration. The armature, which extends through the center of the coils, is mounted on a tube that acts both as a fluid barrier and a cantilever spring. The flapper extends below the assembly on the "wet" side of the joint to control the hydraulic rely on tight diametral clearances (on the order of circuit.
0.0002 in.) between the spool and sleeve to limit leak- The first-stage orifices and filter are combined age flow to manageable values. The leakage through into one assembly to allow the filter to be washed these lapped clearances is herein referred to as lap with the second-stage flow. The filter is sized to en leakage.

Displacement of the spool from a neutral null position instigates flow from one of the two load ports (CYL1 or CYL2). Spool movement  varies the flow areas of the load flow-metering slots in the sec ond stage. Flow proportional to input current is sure protection of the small restrictions in the first stage. Because any pressure drop is identical for both orifice circuits, use of a single filter element for both orifices eliminates the influence of filter pres sure drop on valve null bias. Materials used in this assembly will be chosen for high structural strength, achieved by using rectangular metering slots, in corrosion resistance, and minimum differential which the flow area is directly proportional to spool thermal expansion.



CONTROL AND CONDITION-MONITORING SYSTEMS 251

Servovalve performance requirements are typi cally defined by the following characteristics: rated flow, pressure gain, frequency response, internal leak age, hysteresis, threshold, and linearity. Typical val ues for the type of valves used on the SSME-HAS are as follows:

Rated flow Pressure gain Frequency response Internal leakage Hysteresis Threshold Linearity

7.5 gpm at 3000 psid
14,000 psi/mA
-3 db, -90  at 100 Hz
0.20 gpm at 3000 psid
3% rated current
0.5% rated current
+I0 %

A basic understanding of the mechanics of a two stage servovalve can be gained by examining simpli fied expressions for servovalve performance. The primary static-performance measurements will be seen in internal leakage, pressure gain, and second stage flow. Internal leakage results from first-stage quiescent flow and lap leakage from the second stage;

Second-stage leakage proves a more difficult quantity to predict because of the difficulty encountered in measuring dimensions such as diametral clearance and metering-edge radii. However, the following ex pression provides a reasonable estimate of the leak age through the overlap region of a spool valve:

This expression holds for sleeves with two diametrically-opposed slots. Because the condition of the spool/sleeve metering edges for parameters Cdm and L must be taken into account, the designer must depend on previous experience in developing a two-stage servovalve.

First-stage pressure gain, an important factor in dynamic performance, normally will be measured in the development of a servovalve to verify first-stage sizing. It can be calculated using the following expres sion:

PG1 =

(Co 2 Xf02 + 1) 2

Note that, in a two-stage servovalve, the spool must be locked in the null position to obtain a meaningful first-stage pressure-gain measurement.

where Cd2 = discharge coefficient for metered flow

Nozzle/flapper valves have been used as the first stage of dual-stage servovalves for at least 30 years. More recently, fluidic or completely electromechani cal designs have been replacing nozzle/f lapper valves on many applications.

J e t - p i p e  s e r v o v a l v e s .  In one type of fluidic valve design, the "jet pipe" configuration produced by HR/Textron, movement of the torque-motor ar mature deflects the dominant  portion of a high velocity jet into one of two "receivers," transferring the kinetic energy of the moving oil into differential pressure across a load (Fig. 7-37).

Direct-drive servovalves.  In the last decade, significant work has been done in developing designs to replace the traditional electrohydraulic first stage with a completely electromechanical configuration. These "direct-drive" valves (Fig. 7-38) apply modern rare-earth magnet materials to generate the forces required to move the second-stage load and protect against contamination. The particular concept dis played employs a rotary, limited-displacement dc torque motor and an eccentric ball to impart axial motion to the second-stage spool. A LVDT provides position feedback to the control circuit.

Direct drive significantly reduces quiescent leak age, and the direct mechanical coupling of the motor to the valve also minimizes the effects of vibration, shock, and impulse loads on the null stability and ac curacy of the device. The direct-drive valve currently sees favor in systems requiring great reliability, expe riencing large thermal transitions and high vibration and shock loading, and needing better dynamic per formance.

Design of  Gas-Pressure Regulators

Basically, gas-pressure regulators are variable-area type pressure-reducing valves. They maintain con stant pressure at an outlet or in a downstream region, even though the pressure at the inlet may vary
(decrease). Gas-pressure regulators may be operated independently, or in conjunction with pressure-relief devices, under either dynamic or static conditions.

Fig. 7-39 Schematic of  a typical  gas-pressure regulator controller.

For example, the gas-pressure regulator for the A-4
Stage propulsion system (Fig. 3-13) maintains a con stant main-oxidizer-tank pressure of 165 psia, while the helium gas pressure at the regulator inlet varies from 4500 to 245 psia. If the tank pressure should continue to rise with the regulator completely closed because of such effects as aerodynamic heating, a tank relief valve gives additional protection.

Elements o f  gas-pressure  regulators.  Most pressure regulators include two basic elements, regulator controller and regulator valve. The con troller controls opening of the regulator valve, which then meters the gas flow through the regulator.

The regulator controller, essentially a sensing and computing unit, measures the difference between actual and desired pressure. Its output, called the er ror signal, can be directly applied as a mechanical force, or it can control pressure output to a ser vovalve. Figure 7-39 shows the schematic of a typical gas-pressure regulator controller, the regulated pressure being sensed externally by a bellows, which is internally evacuated, or vented, to atmosphere. The vacuum establishes an absolute pressure reference, while the vented bellows uses ambient pressure for reference (gage pressure). As the regulated pressure
(the sensing pressure) changes, the bellows deflects against a calibrated internal-spring load, simul taneously posit ioning a directly connected ser vovalve (Fig. 7-40), which in turn regulates a control pressure output.

A regulator valve consists of the control valve and an actuator. If only limited accuracy is required, or if very small capacities are involved, the regulator controller can develop the error signal directly as a mechanical force to position the regulator valve. Such a directly spring-loaded pressure regulator is represented schematically in Fig. 7-41a. For greater accuracy, the regulator valve actuator can be posi tioned by controlled pressure from a servovalve con nected to the regulator controller.

Figure 7-40 presents schematically the principle of operation of typical single-bleed, poppet-type, pneumatic servovalves (as used in gas-pressure-regu lating services). Two basic configurations are in use. The first (Fig. 7-40a) regulates output control pressure Pc through variation of the bleed-port-flow area. The

Because the servovalve amplifies them, small er rors in regulated pressure will cause large changes in control-pressure output. This control pressure Pc can then be applied to control the regulator-valve posi tion in the following ways:

1) Control pressure Pc serving as the loading pressure for a simple dome-loaded pressure regula tor, as shown schematically in Fig. 7-41b. A large-ca pacity, dome-loaded pressure regulator can also be loaded by a separate, small-capacity precision pres sure regulator (precision loader).

2) Control pressure Pc serving as the input to a mechanism that positions the regulator valve as a linear function of control pressure. In its simplest form, this mechanism, consists of a spring and a di aphragm (Fig. 7-41c).

When a single-bleed servovalve is used with the regulator controller, the supply pressure Ps to the control servocircuit must be isolated from the inlet pressure Pi to the main regulator valve, because of the steady-state error that would be introduced by the often extreme variation of Pi. A simple, (directly)
spring-loaded, low-capacity regulator, similar to the one in Fig. 7-41a, will be required to reduce Pi to a reasonably constant supply of pressure Ps for the control servocircuit. This regulator, commonly called the "bleed regulator," can be a part of the main regu lator controller.

Design considerations f o r  gas-pressure regulators. Basic considerations for the design of gas pressure regulators include the following:

1) Principal causes of error in a pressure regula tor: variation of inlet pressure, flow demand, and temperature; mechanical hysteresis, friction, and



254 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES creep of stress members; variation in effective length of members because of angular displacement; varia tion in vehicle acceleration, and vibration. Also, the fact that pressures are not sensed at the desired point of pressure control (influence of pressure drops caused by flow through downs t ream systems). Whether or not these errors have been held within allowable tolerances, without mechanisms (including diaphragms and springs) of unreasonable complexity and size, makes the basic test of a good regulator de sign.

2) Proven usage. Where feasible, proven con cepts and control mechanisms of previous designs should be utilized--especially for dynamic character istics, stability and transient response and for me chanical details, such as poppets, seals, diaphragms, and springs.

3) Balance of the regulator-valve poppet.  It should minimize the forces imparted to the valve by inlet pressure Pi. This balance may be achieved by attaching a balance piston, similar to the one of the poppet  servovalves (Fig. 7-40). However, this proce dure will require some type of dynamic seal, and dy namic seals are known to be trouble sources. In cer tain applications, therefore, an unbalanced valve may be preferred.

4) Alternative mode. In most cases, the regula tor must lend itself to the alternate mode of opera tion as a shutoff valve, until the opening of a start pi lot-valve.

5) Lockups. The various gas-pressure-regulator designs in Fig. 7-41 control pressure by admitting ad ditional gas, as required, to the regulated pressure re gion. If the flow demand on the regulator is reduced to zero (dead-end conditions), the regulator valve shuts off. However, the pressure in the regulated re gion may increase above the design point, even with the regulator valve closed, because of a time lag in closing, following reduction of demand to zero; in evitable regulator-valve leakage; and thermodynamic effects, such as increase in temperature of the gas in the regulated pressure region or vaporization of a pressurized liquid. The condition of zero flow, known as a lockup, often poses problems. Lockup can be eliminated by incorporating a relief valve down stream of the regulator valve as part of the regulator assembly. In the A-4 Stage propulsion system, indi vidual relief valves for the main propellant tanks pre vent possible intermixing of propellant vapors.

6) Miscellaneous design considerations for gas pressure regulators: type of regulated gas; gas inlet pressure and temperature range; regulated-gas outlet pressure level with respect to ambient or vacuum, its tolerance or accuracy of regulation, and range of ad justment; required maximum flow capacity; required response time and allowable overshoot; type of line connections; environmental conditions (temperature, vibration, humidity, etc.).

Figure 7-42 presents the dynamic-response char acteristics of a typical pneumatic pressure regulator upon initiation of a demand. The regulator was set at a regulated outlet pressure of 400 psia. The gas used
(helium) was discharged into a system of approxi mately 60-in.3 volume.

Sizing of the  g a s - p r e s s u r e  regulator. Re quired flow area across the regulator valve when it is fully open, i.e., the characteristic flow area of a pressure regulator, may be calculated for required flow capacity and regulated outlet pressure at minimum allowable gas-inlet pressure. The isen tropic-nozzle-flow equation (Table 7-4) is typically used for sizing regulators.

D o m e - l o a d e d  p r e s s u r e  regulators. The dome-loaded type of regulator (Fig. 7-41b), one of the most frequently used regulators, normally em ploys a metallic diaphragm in the main actuator to keep friction low. The dome pressure Pc, which de termines the force to the actuator diaphragm and thus regulates valve position and outlet pressure, can be regulated either internally by a pressure controller or externally by a low-capacity pressure regulator or loader. There are many variations of dome-loaded regulators.

The typical dome-loaded gas pressure regulator, shown in Fig. 7-43, has an alternate mode of opera tion as a shutoff valve. The regulator chiefly main tains a regulated outlet pressure at a preselected value called the "set point." The regulator is composed of four elements: start pilot-valve, bleed regulator, sens ing control unit, and main regulator valve. The com bination of bleed regulator and sensing control unit forms the main regulator controller.

The start pilot va lve~a  solenoid-actuated poppet valve normally held closed by a spr ing-- in  the closed position locks up the outlet pressure of the bleed regulator. The bleed regula tor~a  normally

Fig. 7-44 Typical dome-loaded, zero-gain type gas-pressure regulator loaded by a bleed regula tor. closed, directly-spring-loaded type of pressure-reduc ing valvemsupplies an approximately constant preset pressure to the sensing control unit. This preset pres sure exceeds the main-regulator outlet pressure Pr. It is the sensing control unit, then, that establishes the main-regulator outlet pressure. It detects small devia tions from the set point and magnifiesthe error sig nals by means of a single-bleed, nozzle/flapper ser vovalve linked to a sensor diaphragm by increasing or decreasing the control pressure Pc that operates the actuator diaphragm of the main-regulator valve, a normally-closed, dome-loaded pressure-reducing de vice.

Operations follow this sequence of events. Gas enters the regulator through a filter located at the regulator inlet port, but is prevented from entering the main-regulator-control pressure dome by the closed start-pilot valve. Upon opening the start-pilot valve by energizing its solenoid, gas flows through the bleed regulator and is reduced to pressure Ps, as de termined by the preset reference-spring force. The gas then enters a fixed restrictor and passes into the control dome, where the flow tends to open  the main-regulator valve against the actuator spring. Dome pressure Pc is controlled by varying the flow area of the nozzle/flapper servovalve, which bleeds the loading gas into the main-regulator outlet mani fold. Equilibrium between the sensed regulated-outlet pressure Pr and the sensor-spring force positions the servovalve flapper a sufficient distance off the nozzle seat and maintains a steady-state control pressure pcma pressure always greater than Pr, as determined by the set of the main-regulator-valve actuator spring. Under these steady-state conditions, gas continues to flow from the bleed regulator through the servovalve at a rate determined by the restrictions and out to the outlet manifold. The regulator-controller circuitry has what is called a negative gain. A sensed increase in pressure Pr causes an amplified decrease in con trol pressure Pc, with attendant decrease of the main

G = -- Apc (7-44)
Apr where G - controller gain, Apc = change in control pressure, psi, and AP r - change in sensed pressure, psi. Table 7-5 lists the principal design parameters of the gas-pressure regulator displayed in Fig. 7-43.

Figure 7-44 presents the design layout of a typical dome-loaded, zero-gain type of gas-pressure regula tor. The main-regulator  controller  consists of a spring-loaded bleed regulator and a fixed-area bleed orifice, which gives a constant bleed from the control dome to the regulator outlet. The bleed regulator maintains the control-dome pressure Pc at a constant level. Here, too, control pressure Pc exceeds the reg ulated outlet pressure Pr by an amount determined by the main-regulator-valve actuator-spring preload. This regulator has been designed to maintain an out let pressure Pr of 282 psig +-5 psi at inlet pressures ranging from 5000 to 375 psig. The actuator di aphragms are made of a 0.0025-in., 17-7 PH high strength stainless-steel sheet. All sliding members, such as regulator-valve poppets and guides, use 440C stainless steel to eliminate surface galling. The regu lator main body and housing are made of aluminum alloy forgings.

Integrating-type pressure regulators. Figure
7-45 presents the design of a typical integrating-type gas-pressure regulator that controls the propellant tank pressures of a pressurized-gas propellant feed system such as the A-4 Stage propulsion system. Main-oxidizer-tank pressure is sensed through a rela tively short external line. Fuel-tank pressure is main tained at 10 psi below the oxidizer-tank pressure by different pressure settings of line check-valves and tank-relief valves. A spool-type, four-way servovalve, which is directly connected to the sensor of the regu lator controller, controls the regulator-valve actuator. Supply pressure Ps of the servovalve is taken from the regulator-outlet pressure Pr (i.e., Ps = Pr). The sensor contains two bellows with an oil-filled damper be tween them. The damper consists of a partition with a properly sized orifice. The outer bellows (exposed to the propellant vapors) is hydroformed from thin 321
stainless-steel tubing, because the pressure differential across it is small and because it contains fluid. The inner bellows must withstand a pressure differential equal to full tank pressure, since the interior of this bellows vents directly to the atmosphere.  For this reason, the bellows is machined from 17-4 PH stain less-steel stock. This regulator is called an integrating type because a constant-tank pressure error will pro duce a constant actuator-piston velocity (neglecting extraneous forces). This velocity, in turn, gives a con stant regulator-valve opening (or closing) velocity and a constantly increasing (or decreasing) gas flowrate. Tank pressure is then the integral of tank pressure error vs. time. The integrating type of pres sure regulator provides the constantly increasing reg ulator-valve flow area required for decreasing supply pressures, with minimum error in tank pressure, but may be unstable if the gain of the servovalve and ac tuator combination gets too high. A suitable gain value should be determined by computer  studies of the regulator dynamic characteristics.

Design of Liquid-Flow and Pressure Regulators

Liquid-flow and pressure regulators basically are vari able-area-type, pressure-reducing valves. A liquid-flow regulator maintains a constant rate of flow or limits the maximum rate of a flow. A liquid-pressure regula tor, like a gas-pressure regulator, maintains a constant fluid pressure at its outlet under variable-flow condi tions. Design considerations for liquid-flow regulators and pressure regulators are similar to those for gas regulators.

Design of liquid-Jlow regulators. Liquid-flow control can be obtained with a venturi. The pressure at the throat is proportional to the velocity of the
(incompressible) fluid and thus the flowrate. The pressure differential between throat and inlet can be used to control the position of a butterfly valve, and thus the flowrate, by means of a servocontrol circuit. Figure 7-46 shows the schematic of a regulator of this type.

Figure 7-47 presents the principle of another type of flow regulator that frequently gets used in rocket engine systems because of its simplicity. It consists of two restrictors, one of fixed and the other of variable area. This combination automatically maintains a constant pressure drop across the fixed restrictor, providing a constant flow. The fixed restrictor con sists of a disk containing a number of orifices and mounted  in a piston. The variable restrictor is formed by variable throttle ports located around the piston periphery. The pressure differential across the fixed orifices causes the piston to move against the regulator reference-springs. Piston throttle ports and reference-spring rate are designed to maintain a con stant pressure drop across the orifice disk.

As the fluid inlet-pressure increases, or the back pressure decreases, the flowrate tends to increase also. However, the attendant increase is pressure dif ferential; i.e., pressure force on the piston moves it against the reference springs, simultaneously increas ing the flow restriction. A new equil ibrium is achieved as the inlet-pressure increase is absorbed by an increase in pressure drop across t h e  piston throttle port.

Design of liquid-pressure regulators. Figure
7-48 presents a l iquid-pressure regulator design frequently used in rocket-engine systems. The actua tor diaphragm of the regulator valve (plunger) can be loaded either by a pneumatic reference pressure
(as shown) or by a reference spring. Regulated outlet pressure is sensed directly. An increase in outlet pressure tends to reduce the flow area of the regula tor valve until an equilibrium is reached between out let and reference pressures. The actuator diaphragm is made of Mylar laminations, which are compatible with cryogenic propellants, such as liquid oxygen.

Design of  Pressure-Relief Valves

Pressure-relief valves protect fluid systems and pres sure vessels from being over-pressurized. There are two basic types, the direct-operated and the pilot-op erated. In the direct-operated, the valve poppet  is loaded directly by a properly calibrated reference spring. The valve opens as the pressure force acts against the spring force. In the pilot-operated valve, the main-relief-valve actuator is controlled by a pilot valve calibrated for the desired relief-pressure setting. The direct-operated relief valves are used for large tolerance, low-capacity services. For large-flow re quirements, pilot-~perated relief valves are used for quick response and to avoid excessive size. Most pressure-relief valves are used in gas-pressure sys tems. Important design considerations include type of gas and its conditions; pressure-relief level, its tol erance and range of adjustment; required response



258 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES time, dead-band (differential between actuation or opening, and deactuation or closing pressure), and other dynamic characteristics; required maximum flow capacity; simplicity of construction and line connections; and environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, acceleration, and vibration.

The required flow area for a gas-pressure relief valve at a maximum-opening position, i.e., its charac teristic flow area, can be calculated from the isen tropic nozzle equation of Table 7-4.

Direc t -opera ted  gas -pre s sure  re l ie f  valves. Figure 7-49a shows the design of a typical low-capac ity, direct-operated gas-pressure-relief valve. Its pop pet is loaded directly by a coil spring. This valve is one of the simplest designs, but it may become dy namically unstable under externally introduced vi bration.

Figure 7-49b gives the schematic of an improved design of a direct-operated relief valve, one assuring a predictable deadband and eliminating chatter un der vibration. This design employs coned-disk-type
(Belleville) springs, operating between positive stops, in the negative-rate portion of the force-deflection curve of the spring. As shown in Fig. 7-49b and 7-50, the spring remains against pretravel stop C until the applied force (valve-inlet pressure Pi x valve-poppet seat area) reaches level A. The spring then snaps from C to the post-travel stop D, with no further in crease in applied force. Reduction of the applied force to B will cause the spring to snap back from D to C. The positions of the pretravel/posttravel stops can be adjusted for constant actuation and deactua tion forces, independent of spring-manufacturing tol erances. The coned-disk spring washers are usually made of beryllium copper or 17-7 PH stainless steel. This type of relief valve suits high-pressure-helium storage bottle services, such as in the A-4 Stage propulsion system.

Pi lo t -opera ted  g a s - p r e s s u r e  re l i e f  valves. Figure 4-51 presents the schematic of a typical high capacity, pilot-operated tank-gas-pressure relief valve. Normally, both main and pilot valves are held closed by valve spring forces Fsm, Fs3, and pressure Pc. The pilot-valve controller also senses the tank pressure Pt. When the pressure reaches or exceeds the preset level, the pilot valve is actuated to open (cracking pressure). The open valve vents the main-relief valve-actuator control pressure Pc and, in turn, per mits the main valve to open. The main-valve poppet position is a function of the control pressure, which then is controlled by the position of the pilot-valve poppet and by the tank pressure.

Design of Miscellaneous Fluid Flow Control Components

Check valves. Check valves allow fluid flow to go in only one direction. There are two basic check valve types, the poppet and the swing-gate. Valve selection depends to a great extent on application. General design requirements for check valves include type of fluid and its pressure and temperature, required flow capacity, allowable pressure drop, allowable rate of reverse leakage (including zero leakage), space envelope and line connection, and simplicity of construction.

Figure 7-52 pictures the design of a typical pop pet-type check valve. A light, compression-return spring normally holds the poppet in the closed posi tion, preventing any possibility of fluid leaking back. When fluid pressure is introduced upstream, the poppet will open against the return spring. Because of their relatively high-pressure drop, check valves of this type are used only in low-capacity service, with either elastomer O-rings or metal-to-metal seals.

Figure 7-53 illustrates a swing-gate-type check valve. It consists of two elements, inlet body and out let body. The swing gate is secured to the inlet body. A torsional-type return-spring holds the gate in clos ing position. Swing-gate check valves minimize pres sure drop. However, positive sealing against reverse flow is more difficult. In some applications, orifice holes are drilled in poppets or swing gates to allow a regulated reverse flow for specific control purpose.

The tendency for check valves to oscillate during operation can be overcome by three methods:

1) Design the check valve to be fully open against a stop for the required flowrate and never re duce flow below the design flowrate during service.

2) Provide coulomb (friction) damping.

3) Provide an augmented force to hold the poppet on an open stop at reduced flowrates.

Often, it is not possible to control the actual range of flowrates the check valve will be exposed to, once it is in service. As a result, preventing poppet oscillation by means of method (1) is usually imprac tical. Method (2), friction damping, has been used successfully; but hysteresis introduced by the friction causes cracking and reseating pressures to become less predictable. Method (3), augmenting the poppet force, can extend the range of flow rates over which oscillation does not occur. This range will be some what  narrower than for coulomb damping; but problems associated with hysteresis will not develop.

Augmented-force check valves (Fig. 7-54) in the purge lines on the SSME isolate the pneumatic purge system from propellant systems. Force augmentation is achieved by placing a restriction (B) downstream of the seat adjacent to the poppet head area (C). As

As the poppet moves open, pressure builds up in a cavity (A) intermediate of the seat and the restriction (B). This intermediate pressure pro vides an augmenting opening force by acting against the poppet-head area (C). The poppet in this design will move to a fully-open position and rest on the positive stops at differential pressures lower than the initial cracking differential-pressure, thus extending the range of flow rates with no oscillation.

The check valve in Fig. 7-54 has metal-to-metal seating with a hard facing on both poppet and seat. This arrangement permits service with back pressures

130 scfm of nitrogen at 750 psi and 70'F.

Burst diapbragms. To gain positive, hermetic sealing, the designer will often use burst diaphragms, especially in storable-liquid-propellant engine systems. They also serve as safety valves to prevent excessive pressures or to initiate flow at a prede termined pressure. Burst diaphragms can be ruptured either by the upstream fluid pressure or by me chanical means. General design considerations for burst diaphragms include these important points:

The type of fluid and corrosive characteristics of it.

Duration of storage (especially with corrosive storable liquid propellants).

Method of diaphragm installation in duct or valvebody.

Method of rupture (upstream fluid pressure or other means).

Burst-pressure level (if upstream fluid pressure is used) and its tolerance; environmental temperature effects.

Retention of the diaphragm after rupture (no metal particles are to be ejected).

Allowable pressure drop across the burst di aphragm.

Figure 7-55a shows a typical flat-disk-type burst diaphragm. A V-groove has been coined into it in a horseshoe pattern. The depth of the groove will de termine the burst pressure. The uncoined section serves as a hinge during rupture and as a retainer. The diaphragm can be jointed to the duct by weld ing, brazing, or bolting. This design has been satisfac tory for many applications.

Figure 7-55b shows a poppet-type storable-pro pellant valve with a built-in burst diaphragm, that as sures a positive, hermetic seal of zero leakage during long storage periods. It also protects the elastomer seal of the valve seat. Rupture of the diaphragm oc curs during valve opening, either from valve actua tion or from upstream propellant pressure. When closing, satisfactory valve sealing is provided by the elastomer seal only.

Burst diaphragms are made from a wide variety of metals. Annealed aluminum alloys such as 1100-0
and 6061-0, are among the alloys most easily con trolled. Burst diaphragms rupture in a combination of shearing, bending, and tearing. The exact burst pressure of a specific diaphragm design can be eval uated only experimentally. Variations of the mate rial's ultimate strength have a pronounced effect. The consistency of the desired diaphragm burst-pres sure level will be greatly enhanced by the following precautions in manufacturing and quality control:

Grinding the raw sheet or diaphragm to ensure uniform, accurate thickness.

Close control of groove depth, by precision coining or machining, and by stress-relieving before and after coining.

Continuous testing of the diaphragm material for hardness.

Close control of the clamping pressure with bolted diaphragms.

Close control of the welding or brazing pro cesses to minimize heat effects.

Proper dimensioning of diaphragm thickness and groove depth to allow for corrosive effects of the propellant during storage.

It is possible to hold burst-pressure variations of a specific diaphragm design to within 2% for di aphragms of over 1-in. diameter and design burst pressures greater than 300 psi. For diaphragms of smaller size and lower burst-pressure, this tolerance may increase up to 5%. Because deliverable burst di aphragms cannot be tested, a number of samples are drawn from each manufacturing lot for testing. The number of samples is determined statistically to meet specific reliability requirements.

Explosive-actuated valves. For a device that may be required to operate only once (either to open or to close), an explosive-actuated valve pro vides the smallest possible size and weight. Because the power of the explosive actuation is virtually un limited, a rigid, hermetic, zero-leakage-type seal can be used with this type of valve.

Corp). The actuator of this normally closed valve consists of an explosive charge "A" and a ram "B,"
including a shearing head "D." The seal of the valve has a solid metal diaphragm "E," machined as an in tegral part of the valve body. Upon an electrical sig nal the explosive charge detonates and drives the ram forward to cut out the seal diaphragm as a single piece of metal and hold it firmly against the end plug
"F." The tapered head of ram "B" plunges into the guide-hole edge and causes a perfect metal-to-metal seal at point "C." This seal prevents contamination of the working fluid with gases from the explosive charge. The input current required for this valve is about 0.5 A, and actuation of the valve takes about
0.002 s.

7.3 DESIGN OF INSTRUMENTATION AND HARNESSES

Engine Instrumentation

For high-performance liquid rocket engines to meet demanding mission objectives, all component  sub systems must be designed to operate at peak perfor mance levels. All of the components are monitored continuously during the construction and hot-fire testing phases to ensure that reliable performance characteristics will be maintained throughout devel opment and delivery. It is only through the use of highly specialized instrumentation and dedicated computing capability that closed-loop control, con dition monitoring, and engine safety requirements can be met.

To successfully instrument a rocket-engine sys tem, the designer must understand the intricacies of normal engine operation. This understanding should then be followed by instruction in instrumentation basics and control theory tempered by a meaningful treatment of rocket-engine failure mode data. Before instrumentation can be installed on an engine, de tailed analyses must be performed to define fatigue factors, vibration levels, and heat-transfer characteris tics. From a purely functional standpoint, individual sensor designs can range from the relatively simple to the highly complex. Selecting the right sensor for the job directly impacts the performance and reliability characteristics of an engine system.

Typical rocket-engine systems contain a large array of instrumentation for specific measurement tasks, in four main categories reflecting the criticality of the control system: engine ready (blueline), safety
(redline), control, and condition monitoring. Some of these tasks require redundant measurements using either multiple sensors or multiple-channel sensors.

Five essential parameters must be monitored in an engine: temperature, pressure, flow rate, pump/
turbine speed, and vibration. Measurements will be made during the engine design-verification or devel opment stages plus condition-monitoring evaluations of roller bearings, coolant liners, turbine blades, etc. Sensors such as strain gages and heat-flux calorime ters are generally used for such measurements.

Proper instrumentation requires that a sensor or sensor system satisfy a wide range of operating pa rameters. A good rule of thumb sets a target for each sensor of using a third to two-thirds of its total range. This will be particularly important for pressure sen sors because they tend to be more accurate within this range.

A thorough sensor evaluation is especially im portant when designing or specifying sensor compo nents to be used in close proximity to engine hard ware, due primarily to the violent nature of the en gine environment. A shallow knowledge of rocket engine behavior  can produce disastrous results. Material compatibility is a major issue where liquid oxygen is concerned. Many non-metallic materials are not tolerated by the liquid-oxygen environment and can produce a violent, sometimes explosive re action. Hydrogen on the other hand, interferes with the in tergranular  s t ructure of certain nickel chromium alloys (17-4pH for example), leading to material degradation. Special consideration should be given to the thermal properties of materials
(thermal range and thermal expansion) since these effects can compound structural weaknesses.

Most importantly, once a sensor has been se lected for use in an engine, proof that it functions properly over the specified temperature range will be essential to its eventual acceptance into established sensor inventories. Although a given temperature sensor might not be rated for use at liquid-oxygen or liquid-hydrogen temperatures, it is often possible to
"extend" thermal ranges by performing a calibration at the "new" operating temperature.

Principal Types of  Instrumentation

T e m p e r a t u r e  s e n s o r s .  There are three com mon sensors used  for measuring temperature:
thermocouples ,  resistance temperature  detectors
(RTDs), and thermistors (Table 7-6).

Two dissimilar metal wires joined at one end forms a thermocouple. It generates an electromotive force (EMF) proportional to its bulk temperature. Thermocouples are simple, rugged, and have fast re sponse time, 100 ms for very small wire diameters. They can readily be installed into most engine de signs. Thermocouples are available in a variety of types for specific applications (Table 7-7).

As a disadvantage, a thermocouple has very low output voltage (Fig. 7-57), approximately 60 mV, thus



262 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES necessitating a signal amplifier. In addition, thermo couple output tends to drift over time, and that, de pending on the usage time-frame, may create a prob lem. There are other design factors to take into ac count before selecting a specific thermocouple for a given application. Grounded-type thermocouples have a faster response time than ungrounded, but a shorter useful life due to mechanical strain induced during thermal cycling (Fig. 7-58 and 7-59).

Thermoelectric elements should also be matched to the physical environment in which they will be used. For example, iron-constantan thermocouples rust when exposed to moist environments. For this reason, sealed sheaths normally protect thermocou pie wires. Whenever possible, thermal-expansion co efficients of the thermoelectric materials should be matched to those of the sheath material to minimize thermally-induced-strain effects.

The resistance temperature detector (RTD), a wound coil made of platinum or nickel wire whose resistance varies with temperature, gives stable per formance over long periods and is highly accurate, especially while sensing at cryogenic temperatures. The coil RTD often forms the fourth leg of a wheat stone bridge that converts variable resistances into voltages. Like the thermocouple device, the RTD output is nonlinear, but can be characterized through the use of a polynomial-fit equation. Unfortunately,

Fig. %60 Cryogenic temperature sensor.

RTDs tend to be fragile and must be packaged for the environment  of a specific application. Second, an
"area"-sensitive device, the RTD has a s lower re sponse than the thermocouple.  Figure 7-60 shows a two-element RTD used for measuring cryogenic tem peratures.

The third type of temperature  sensor, called a thermistor, a semiconductor  device with a limited operating range, primarily has been  used for moni toring the tempera ture  of other  electronic equip ment. Thermistors have a fast response time and are very nonlinear. They must use a linearization circuit to provide a linear vol tage-to- temperature relation ship. They are also easily damaged; thus packaging requirements are an important design consideration.

P r e s s u r e  s e n s o r s .  Pressure measurements  fre quently require that sensors opera te  over a wide temperature range at high vibration levels. Two types of pressure  measu remen t s  concern  rocket-engine designers: static and dynamic. Static-pressure mea surements can be performed with sensors having low f requency response ,  typically less than 1000 Hz. These sensors can be installed some distance from the p ressure  por t  wi th  a sma l l -d iamete r  tube connecting the port to the sensor. In cases where the pressure  media  will exper i ence  very high tem peratures (>600"F)uin the combust ion chamber,  for example,  this type of measu remen t  is preferable because the sensors can be installed in a m o r e - b e  nigh thermal environment.

Dynamic pressure measurements  require sensors to be installed near the pressure media. For a high frequency-response sensor (>5 kHz), the sensing ele ment (i.e., diaphragm) should be in almost immedi ate contact with the pressure media or flush to the surface of the pressure chamber.

Piezoelectric pressure sensors are used primarily for measuring dynamic-pressure components ,  exten sively in the development  phase.  The term p i e z o means "to squeeze," and conveys the principle upon which these sensors operate. A quartz crystal is pack aged inside a hermetically sealed container. In its equilibrium state the sensor reads "zero." But acted upon by an external pressure wave, the crystal pro duces a static charge on its surface proportional to the applied pressure. As the pressure stabilizes, how ever, the charge dissipates and the sensor's output re turns to zero.

The most common type of pressure t ransducer utilizes a standard resistance gage to measure strain on an object and convert it to a pressure value (Fig.
7-61). Such a sensor has a metal diaphragm or force collector that employs strain gages at the areas of minimum and maximum strain. When connected to a Wheatstone-bridge network, the sensor produces a full-scale output  of approximately 5 mV per volt of excitation. Pressure sensors utilizing foil-gage tech nology are limited to a bulk temperature of approxi mately 250"F.

The term "piezoresistive" is reserved for pressure transducers embodying semiconductor  measuring el ements. Small pieces of P- and N-type silicon (pro cessed specifically for t ransducer  applications) are bonded  to a central diaphragm. The P-type material increases its resistance with an applied load; N-type material, the opposite.  Connected  to a s tandard Wheats tone bridge, this circuit makes  an effective pressure-measuring device. These sensors are used in many high-temperature applications and are not as prone to the sensitivity and linearity shifts often as sociated with other pressure-sensing devices.

Pressure switches are used when  it is not neces sary to monitor  the absolute analog pressure of a given media. Like the other pressure sensors, pres sure switches use diaphragms as the force collector, which in turn actuates a switch at a predetermined pressure level. That level can be preset at the factory or set in the field.



264 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

A c c e l e r o m e t e r s .  Accelerometers measure the acceleration of an engine component  that has been subjected to shock and vibration. Most acceler ometers utilize the same piezoelectric technology as dynamic pressure sensors. A single quartz crystal is packaged together with a seismic mass and spring mechanism. Variations in pressure on the piezo electric element change its electrostatic charge in proportion to the vibration/shock load. This sensor has a very high natural frequency, making it ideal for shock and vibration measurements.  Piezoelectric accelerometers can be used from -450 to 1400"F and are available in single- or multiple-axis config urations. Figure 7-62 shows a miniature accelerome ter used for measuring engine-component vibration.

F l o w m e t e r s .  Flowmeters are fundamental to propellant/oxidizer mixture-ratio determinations in the main combustion chamber. Flowrates are ex pressed in volumetric units or weight per unit time. Flowmeter selection criteria depend  on the fluid environment and the data type required by the engine controller. Turbine and venturi are two common flowmeter types.

The turbine flowmeter has been used in rocket engines very successfully for years (Fig. 7-63). A rela tively simple device, it has a turbine wheel suspended in a duct. The turbine rotates freely driven by the gas or liquid flowing past. The rotational speed of the turbine is proportional to the velocity of the fluid. Since flowrates are usually constant, the turbine's ro tational speed is also a true representation of the volumetric rate of fluid moving through the flowme ter. Turbine rotation is sensed through the flowmeter body by an external pickup mounted on the surface directly above the flowmeter rotor. The rotation produces a train of electrical pulses in the pickup. The frequency of these pulses can then be transmit ted to the appropriate readout electronics in the en gine controller. The output characteristics of the flowmeter are quite linear. Accuracies to 0.5% full scale (FS) can be obtained. Repeatability is a re spectable 0.1% FS or less.

Rocket-engine test stand facilities frequently use differential-pressure flowmeters to measure fluid flow. Either venturis or orifice plates are used as the pri mary restrictive elements limiting fluid flow in a lo calized region. Differential pressure sensed near the

Fig. 7-62 SSME flight accelerometer. restriction can be related to the actual fluid flowrate. The output of this flowmeter is nonlinear (a square root function) and the dynamic range is limited to
4:1. Orifice plates and venturis cause a permanent static-pressure loss in the flow system. However, ven turis can measure approximately two-thirds more flow at the same differential pressure than the sharp edge orifice of the same size.

S p e e d  sensors .  Turbopump shaft speed needs monitoring to verify its performance while con firming that redline shaft speeds are not being exceeded. The typical speed sensor is a variable reluctance type consisting of a permanent magnet and an independent pole piece surrounded by a coil winding of thin-filament magnet wire (Fig. 7-64). The speed sensor is installed through the turbopump case in close proximity to the speed-nut  assembly mounted on the pump shaft. The speed nut has a collection of equally sized and spaced teeth around its outer diameter. Each tooth passing through the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnet induces an ac voltage in the coil winding. This voltage pulse is transmitted to the engine controller,

which converts the signal frequency to a voltage proportional to the shaft speed.

S t ra in  gages .  Strain gages help to quantify strain levels in various engine components  for design verification or failure investigation. Although strain gages are simple devices, to properly employ them requires the user to understand the selection criteria explicitly in terms of precision, strain magnitude, temperature extremes, cyclic endurance,  and other test variables including the availability of desired gage types. Technical support  provided by the strain-gage manufacturer contributing importantly to the success of strain-gage selection and installation.

Three main types of strain gage are commer cially available: nickel-chromium (also known as ni chrome), semiconductor, and foil. All are available as single units or in gage combinat ions  called rosettes. Three-gage rosettes are widely used in stress analysis where magnitude and direction are totally unknown.

Temperature fluctuations represent an important source of error for strain gages because resistance changes with both strain and temperature. Compen sating for temperature-induced error can be done in a number of ways. A "dummy" gage, identical to the active gage, can be attached to an unstrained coupon of the same material as the active gage and subjected to the same temperature conditions. Both active and dummy gages then connected to adjacent legs of a Wheatstone bridge will cause the resistance changes due to temperature to cancel. Another approach is to measure the temperature at the gages; this requires that the strain-gaged assembly be calibrated before use. The calibration will provide the necessary char acteristic curve(s) to correct for thermal error. In either case, it is advisable to use temperature compensated strain gages.

P o s i t i o n  s e n s o r s .  Control-system feedback loops depend heavily on the use of position sensors, particularly when modulating components  such as valves and actuators are involved. These devices literally translate the mechanical position of a device
(valve position 90% OPEN, for example)  into an electrical output. This information can then be used for throttling control of the propuls ion system. System safety or start enable/inhibit parameters are other possible commands. As a unique feature, this ence/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) envi ronments.

Potentiometer displacement sensors have been used in various capacities for reporting valve and ac tuator position. They are cost-effective and require no specialized signal-conditioning equipment  to be incorporated into a control system. They do suffer the disadvantages, being a variable-resistor type, of necessarily experiencing mechanical  wear of the wiper and coil. Second, these sensors are extremely noisy when vibrated. Third, like the LVDT, they can be a bit large. It should be noted that if cost is im portant and long life is not an issue, this type of sen sor may well be worth considering.

Certain valve and actuator applications require only that the home positions (full-open or full-close)
be reported. If it will not be cost-effective to incorpo rate a high-priced, customized sensor, requiring ex tensive signal conditioning, then limit switches make an ideal choice, especially when the engine does not need throttling. Limit switches have been used in many rocket-engine applications with a high degree of success. They are extremely cost-effective and, even when used in redundant systems, maintain a high degree of reliability.

I n s t r u m e n t a t i o n  Insta l lat ion

T e m p e r a t u r e  s e n s o r s .  Sensor chosen for a particular measurement,  the designer should direct attention to the selection of an appropriate sensor port before beginning any support hardware designs. Selecting a commercia l ly  available tempera ture sensor will make installation design considerably easier. Otherwise, further analyses will be required to define the structure that best facilitates the sensor installation. Sensors should be compat ible  with propellent and engine-hardware requirements, both internally and externally. Equally important, the designer must assure himself that the installation does not put the sensor in a posit ion to cause measu remen t  errors (stem conduct ion,  velocity errors, inadequate immersion into the flow, etc).

P r e s s u r e  s e n s o r s .  Pressure-sensor installation procedures depend on the designer's understanding of the pressure media to be measured  and also whether static or dynamic pressures are to be sensed. sensor type can be readily built into valve or actuator Pressure sensors will be installed either directly or hardware, remotely from the pressure media depending on the

Supercooled lines



266 D E S I G N  OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES may produce an ice obstruction in the line, resulting in faulty or loss of measurement.  Connecting lines must be also be designed with adequate diameters and lengths. The lines must be fastened to the struc ture to withstand severe vibration levels. Again, it is equally important  that the installation not put the sensor or pressure-pickup point in a position to cause measurement  errors (velocity errors, total pressure, etc).

In designs requiring dynamic pressure measure ments, sensors should be installed as close to the pressure media as possible. In applications where the frequency response desired runs above 4 kHz, it is advisable to have the pressure-sens ing  e lement
(diaphragm) in close proximity with the media. The diaphragm should never protrude into the flow.

For a dynamic response from 100 Hz to 4 kHz, the pressure-sensing element may be located several inches away from the pressure media. This is conve nient if the sensor cannot be installed directly or the surrounding environment prevents it from being lo cated in close proximity. It is always recommended to analyze the pressure cavity to ensure that the cav ity resonant modes combined with the tap-transducer cavity come well above the measured pressure fre quency range.

Figure 7-65 shows a typical sensor installation in the thrust chamber  of a rocket  eng inempressure transducer and acoustic-cavity equivalents, plus asso ciated equations.

A c c e l e r o m e t e r s .  To gain accurate and useful information, special care must be taken to couple the sensors properly to the test component.  Attachment methods must not introduce any distortion and the sensors must be mounted rigidly to a base structure that responds to the frequency range of interest. Whenever  possible, the accelerometer  should be mounted  on a stud base. The accelerometer  base must be in good contact with the test object and care should be taken to ensure a flush mating with a smooth,  flat surface. Standard machine  screws should be avoided because, since they lack a flange or shoulder, it is possible to bottom them in the ac celerometer, thereby changing its dynamic response and possibly causing damage to the unit. For an electrically insulated installation, special care must be taken to isolate the accelerometer  from the electrical ground, thereby preventing ground loops.

Making accelerometer  attachments to surfaces that cannot be drilled or tapped present a unique problem. As one way to resolve it, the sensor can be cemented directly into the test object. Adhesives should not be scraped or sanded from the ac celerometers; this creates a rough mounting surface and can cause poor frequency response and a possi ble increase in transverse sensitivity.

CONTROL AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 267

In certain applications, mounting the accelerom eter on the test object may effect the system being measured and thus the nature of the data obtained. With piezoelectric accelerometers, this occurs for one of two reasons: (1) the fixture required to couple the accelerometer to a flexible structure may intro duce local stiffening, thus changing the structural re sponse,  or (2) the added mass of the fixture/
transducer may change the system characteristics. Effects due to either can be reduced or eliminated by choosing the smallest and lightest accelerometer possible.

F l o w m e t e r s .  The turbine-type flowmeter can be installed in a simple fashion between available flanges in existing ducting (Fig. 7-63). This type of transducer is very sensitive to velocity-profile dis turbances in the flow stream. The line configuration should therefore minimize or eliminate flow distur bances during calibration and use. The line should be straight for a minimum of 10 diameters upstream and 5 diameters downstream. The presence of major flow. disturbances caused by turbopumps,  valve inlets/outlets may require even greater straight sections.

If swirl is present in the line ahead of the flowme ter installation, a longer straight section may be re quired or flow straighteners may need to be installed. Flow straightening should conform to industry stan dards and specifications. Piping and system compo nents should be arranged to minimize pulsations en tering the turbine meter. Pulsations may cause the meter to read high, and excessive pulsations may cause permanent bearing damage. Pulsations should be kept below 10% of flowrate at the meter location.

P i c k u p  i n s t a l l a t i o n .  The magnetic pickup output, a low-level signal, will range from 10 mv to several volts peak-to-peak. The following rules govern proper installation:

 Do not mount the pickup close to electrical equipment producing large electrical fields (motors, relays, etc).

 Use twisted and shielded cable for the pickup/amplifier connection.

 Hard or flexible conduit for the pickup cable must not be shared with other cabling carrying high level power sources.

 Use a #14 AWG or larger-diameter ground wire connected from the amplifier ground to the pickup body or pipe to reduce the incidence of electrical noise.

S t r a i n  gages .  The installation of strain gages is by itself a considerable science. Each application deserves special care and study. The selection of valid gage characteristics is very important to optimizing performance, taking into account the operating environment while obtaining accurate anti reliable strain measurements.

Strain gages can be bonded satisfactorily to al most any solid material if the material surface is pre pared properly. Cleanliness is vital. Throughout the surface-preparation process, it is wise to guard against contamination. The opt imum surface finish for strain-gage bonding depends upon the nature and purpose of the installation. The recommended sur face finishes for several classes of gage installation are summarized as below.

The normal method to locate and orient a strain gage accurately on the test surface first marks the sur face with a pair of crossed reference lines at the point where the strain measurement will be made. The lines are made perpendicular to one another, with one oriented in the direction of the strain mea surement. The lines should be made with a tool that
"burnishes" rather than scores or scribes the surface
(ballpoint pen or a round-poin ted  brass rod). Graphite pencils should never be used on high-tem perature alloys where the operating temperature might cause carbon embrittlement. All residue from the burnishing operation should be removed by scrubbing with conditioners used on cotton-tipped applicators. Cleaning solutions should never be al lowed to dry on the surface. The final step in surface preparation brings the surface condition back to an optimum alkalinity of 7.0 to 7.5 pH. Preparations to achieve the right alkalinity are available from strain gage suppliers.

Several adhesives are available for bonding strain gages for use at temperatures ranging f r o m  452 to 700"F. Special bonding materials--notably ce ramic "paints" and flame-sprayed ceramics- -are available for temperatures up to 1200"F.

The weldable gage, a precision foil sensor bonded to a metal carrier, can be spot-welded to structures and other surfaces. Spot welding proves convenient, particularly where bonding conditions are not ideal. It can be done with a stored-energy handprobe spot welder.

P o s i t i o n  s e n s o r s .  Most position sensors in rocket  engines  are specifically des igned  for measuring a mechanical  displacement  within a subsys tem/component  normally used for closed loop controls (i.e., fuel/oxidized valves, actuators). The sensor installation concepts should be integrated in the earlier stages of the subsys tem/component development. This will avoid unnecessary costs in developing a radical design. Furthermore, the engine designer must come to understand the operation and function of all mechanisms involved in the design. This will aid the integration of sensor and other mechanisms. In general, the designer will follow good engineering practices to achieve a successful installation.

These components must be designed and manufactured to the same standards as any other engine component or subsystem. In addition to the cabling required to interconnect the various engine electrical subsystems, other cables are required to link the subsystems to the vehicle systems. This includes wiring for power supply, controls (start and stop, power up, throttling, etc.), instrumentation, and checkout circuits. To facil itate engine installation and line connections, these wires will be combined into trunks, each terminating in connectors that must have a mating counterpart on the vehicle. The vehicle-to-engine interface con nections use a "J-Box" (junction box) into which are plugged both the engine and the connectors to vehi cle systems. The "J-Box" permits easy and environ ment-protected redistribution of incoming and out going wires to assigned connectors.

The typical block diagram in Fig. 7-66 depicts the principal electrical connections between engine subsystems and vehicle.

Requirements.  Proper design of a rocket engine wire harness must consider the following:

 Working environment
 Importance of signal transmitted
 Materials
 Harness-construction type
 Routing (minimum distance, interference)
 Secure clamping (safety, avoidance of wire chafing)
 Selection of attachment points (avoidance of special brackets)
 Adequate support  (harness weight,  vehicle acceleration)
 Moisture protection (potting, sheathing)
 Heat protection (routing, wrapping)
 Arching protection (corona & dead shorts)

 Flexibility (installation, stiffness vs. bending load)

 EMI requirements/protect ion
 Redundancy
 Maintenance of harness and engine

For manufacture, the designer must supply certain information, this is best combined into a single as sembly drawing containing the following informa tion:

1) Wire list. This list (Fig. 7-67) calls out each harness wire by number, color, and conductor size, and defines its termination hardware. It also speci fies the wire routing be tween  end points (plugs and/or  receptacles) and shield-termination schemes.

2) Harness schematic. For clarity, the schematic repeats in pictorial form most of the information supplied in the wire list, together with additional in formation. Signal names, logic names, grounds, volt ages, and functions may be specified. Use of a schematic is optional.

3) Physical routing diagram. This diagram (as shown in Fig. 7-68) defines the branch points and their relative distance from the primary connector, clocking (if required) all part numbers used in as sembly, identification, nomenclature, wire size, and type. Each connector will have its shell size, contact arrangement, polarity, application name, and refer ence designation on a hard callout (field note).

Design Considerations

Design considerations span a wide range of diverse factors.

Thermal.  Thermal environments fall generally into six categories: ambient, sub-zero, hot gas, plasma gas, cryogenic and combinations of those. Each en vironment establishes its own parameters. Ambient

Secondary Shied Termination conditions can often be harnessed with almost any available approved flight materials and of course may use the special materials, and designs used in hostile applications.

When harnessing in sub-zero conditions, care should be used in finding proper materials. Many soft goods will not perform well at such thermal lev els. Fast freezing makes good protection from water an essential. Cryogenic conditions occur when nor mal a tmospheric  gases liquify. Insulations, soft goods, and resins will become brittle or fractured. Thermal coefficients of expansion for connectors become a factor as well as sealants in hermetic con nectors. Hot gas and plasma environments also re quire special material; insulations are usually woven glass or ceramic.

Vibration. Vibration can have a detrimental ef fect on all engine harnesses. Harnesses for high-vi bration areas require the use of stress/strain relief, good clamping techniques, potted backshells, and thicker insulation. High-reliability connectors should be used for interconnection.

Humidity Humidity can be a serious problem if not handled correctly. Humidity causes short-circuit failures, corrosion failure, and water/ ice damage. When harnessing in extreme humidity it is important to avoid trapping moisture in harness or connector areas. Braided harnesses and non-potted backshells tend to trap moisture and should be avoided if pos sible. Dual wall (glue-wall) sleeving should be used. Rigid sleevings should be avoided due to the cracking problems associated with them.

Material compatibility Candidate materials for harness use need to be scrutinized, because incom

270 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES patible materials are a leading cause of harness failure. Metallic materials need to be compared on the galvanic scale to avoid galvanic corrosion. Materials selected (especially soft goods and plat ings) must be compat ib le  with specified flight requirements. Flammability and outgassing require ments require definition.

Weight Minimum-weight  requirements are al ways important in space vehicles; but integrity, sur vivability, reliability and service life should never be sacrificed for less weight.

Bend radii Bend radii fall into two categories:
bend radius at connector/ termination and routing bend radii. When harnesses exit connectors, the ini tial bend will exhibit the most critical element on the life of a harness. Care must be taken to limit the amount of bend transmitted to the relief and har ness-configuration connector. As a general rule, 10X diameter of harness is considered optimum, 3X mini mum, for bend radius. Care must be taken to avoid sharp objects, corners, and other damaging parts as well as hot ducts and moving parts when routing har ness and determining bend radii. It is important to maintain adequate clamping always.

Harness routin~ Harnesses should be routed in a manner  that prevents damage to harness or the connector. When clamping next to the connector, an effort should be made to eliminate side play
(especially on angled backshells). Side play tends to loosen backshells and connectors, causes birdcaging in braided harnesses,  and can cause conductor breakage. The first clamp should be located within 6 in. of the backshell exit. Harness clamps should be located in a manner that will prevent the harness from contacting sharp edges and other surfaces that can cause damage. The maximum distance between clamps should be 15 in. Multiple harnesses may be secured in a single clamp. Bend radii should be maintained by proper clamping. Routing on fuel lines should be avoided. Loops should not be left that maintenance personnel can use as hand or foot holds.

Shielding. It is sound practice when designing harnesses to provide shielding to eliminate noise, crosstalk, EMP, and RF interference and to provide a good ground connection. When designing shielding, care should be taken not to produce ground loops.

Harnesses that need protection from electromag netic pulse (EMP), fire, or lightning strikes must be designed in a manner that will allow a high energy pulse to be absorbed and directed to the ground without degradation of signal. Most designs use a flexible or rigid outer sheath that will carry the high energy pulse to engine ground. Flexible sheath mate rials are generally woven into a fabric or braid con figuration around the conductor bundle. Materials used in braiding include copper with nickel plate, stainless steel, and Inconel. Rigid sheaths are usually copper and are supplied only as coax. Braided har nesses need special connector  backshells to termi nate the sheath mechanically and electrically. Care should be exercised to prevent ground loops when mechanically terminating secondary harness ends.

Signals Signals usually are ac or dc and analog or digital. Input signals to the engine controller orig inate from the instrumentation, and output signals are transmitted to the engine control valves. Proper engine function depends upon good signal quality. Proper shielding will help guide unwanted electronic signals to ground. Power signals should be run in separate cables from data signals on the same har ness leg. Shielded twisted pairs and triples should be used for most signals.

Noise Unwanted impulses absorbed into the sig nal carrier create noise. There are two kinds of noise, spurious and common-mode.  Spikes from other electronic carriers either near or around the signal carrier cause spurious noise. Common-mode is pri marily ac noise induced by radio frequency (RF)
waveform or magnetic fields. Proper shielding prac tices will help block spurious but not common-mode noise; it must be attenuated through the use of prop erly designed signal-conditioning equipment.

Electromagnetic interferenc~ Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is caused by magnetic fields penetrating the outer shield. That changes the ampli tude and RF waveform. Since 90 deg to the electronic field, a strong, dynamic magnetic (e) field creates a disturbance in the electron flow. EMI can best be eliminated by a complete shield sized to attenuate the energy in the greatest e-field found (or expected)
and good conduction to ground.

Crosstalla Two analog ac signals running parallel to each other can cause crosstalk (signal crossover). The waveforms transmitted tend to increase in amplitude and frequency as they interact with each other. Running signals in twisted pairs and triplets help reduce cross talk. Further, power should be isolated from data signals whenever possible by the use of shielded cabling and segregation.

Conductorx When choosing wire it is important to look at a current vs. resistance. As a rule, aircraft use 600-V RMS wire with resistance selected by choice of an AWG. Resistance is usually kept to less than 1
ohm over the engine-harness conductor length.

Conductor insulation. Rocket engines, owing to the severe environments in which they operate, need special insulation, the best of which are in the Teflon series TFE, PTFE, PFA. Teflon is basically limited to an operation temperature of 200F. The insulation should be heavier than standard military wire for protection against high vibration. It is always better to use a solid insulation rather than braided insula tion unless nothing else is available (such as ceramic braid in hot-gas environment).

Conductor assemblies The standard wire used for harnessing, multi-conductor cable grouped in sets of two or three, can be shielded or unshielded (shielded preferred) ,  twis ted (preferred)  or non- twis ted, stranded (preferred) or solid. Groups of multi conductors are bundled to make a harness run. When implementing a redundant harness, the backup will usually be routed in the opposite direction and never tied into the primary assembly.

Conductor construction Solid conductor  wire normally will not be used in harnessing since it should not be crimped, is not flexible, and will break upon repeated bending. In special cases, solid con ductor can be used (wire welds, transitions, etc.). Stranded conductor wire is considered to be the best



CONTROL AND CONDITION-MONITORING SYSTEMS 271

choice for harnessing. It is crimpable and flexible, and has a long fatigue life. Preferred strand configu rations are bundles of seven or nine conductors re gardless of individual strand AWG.

Conductor material Conductor material should be high-strength copper alloy. High-strength alloy gives excellent pull and crimp strength with little sac rifice to higher-resistance values. Pure copper should be avoided except under  special circumstances. Other materials include nickel wire, thermocouple harness wire, fiberoptic cable, and stainless steel. Aluminum should not be used due to galvanic corro sion.

Conductor plating, Plating will normally be used to prevent corrosion on copper-alloy conductors. Nickel plating is used extensively due to its excellent properties. Silver plate is to be avoided due to oxide growth and bad galvanic relationship with copper. Unplated copper wire should never be used except in noncorrosive conductors (such as nickel, nickel al loys, and stainless steel).

Coaxial conductors Coax is commonly used for RF signals. The "RG" series is recommended due to its inherent ability to mate with existing connector systems. When choosing coax, impedance must be matched as well as voltage standing-wave ratio
(VSWR) in the selected connectors. Careful attention must be made to verify that all components of coax to cable are matched: center conductor AWG, di electric ID and OD, braid and braid type (foil, braid, etc.), and outer sheath OD. If required, low-noise coax may be used; it incorporates a second outer conductor to shunt EMI and noise to ground.

Connectorx Connector assemblies can be very versatile as long as the design stays within the chosen series. When choosing parts, threads, contacts, shell sizes, and materials must be compatible. The choice of connector series should be based upon these pa rameters:

 A qualified standard part
 Flight-rated and certified
 Reliability failure history based upon in-house experience and industry alerts
 Available standard materials (pins, sockets, shells, platings)
 Electronic characteristics (attenuation, current,

VSWR)
 Available pin sizes
 Backshell accommodations
 Density of contacts
 Shape (bulkhead, firewall, etc.)
 Hermetic availability
 Scoop-proof (no bent pins)
 Connector shell-type (circular, "D", miniature, etc.)
 Interconnect type (threaded, bayonet, breech lock, etc.)
 Availability
 Self-locking, non-locking

Self-locking connectors can lock themselves in position after being assembled and do not loosen in working environments. Locking schemes can be ratcheting, wire bales, jam nuts, or screw posts. Self locking connectors are preferred over non-locking types.

Non-locking connectors require help to stay in stalled while in use. Lockwire, locktite, or Torque stripe can be used to keep connectors tight.

High reliability High reliability, as the name implies, means withstand severe environments with out degradation or loss of electrical signal. High-re liability connectors are designed primarily for high vibration and high-moisture environments.

Hermeticx Hermetic connectors are normally used on assemblies that require a gas-tight seal. Hermet ic-connector  assemblies are inseparable
(contacts cannot be removed or replaced). Most hermetic connectors have a shell with a permanent dielectric (glass) insulator around the pins. The glass insulator can be a small bead or can cover the whole insert area. Hermetic connectors are usually circular.

Mechanical retention Bayonet connectors are used in applications where side loading and vi bration are not present. Bayonet connectors are fully engaged in less than one turn. Threaded con nectors come in two main series, standard thread and tri-start thread. Standard thread uses English or metric threads to retain the connector; this style is used less in new designs. Most new designs now use tri-start connectors. Tri-starts become fully engaged in about one full turn and require low hand-torque to lock and seal. The thread-form type has three lead-in circular threads with a modified acme form in either English or metric pitch.

Scoop-proof Scoop-proof connectors should be used whenever possible because they prevent bent pins, a major cause of connector failure.

Connector clocking, When two or more of the same connectors are used in one place, clocked con nectors can prevent accidental/ incorrect hookup. Clocked connectors use polarized keys on the con nector to prevent mismating. Polarized connectors make interconnection "fool-proof" by eliminating the possibility of improper connector mating. In addi tion, the harness design should avoid placing two or more of the same connectors close enough to be cross-connected.

Pins and sockets The national electric code requires that power supplied by sockets and that mat ing pins be the correct size for the intended service. This ph i losophyuin tended  to stop accidental short ing across unprotected pins with a foreign conduc tormshould be used unless precluded by other re quirements. Contact materials are usually gold plated alloy 52 (iron-nickel) with a crimp socket for connector interconnection.

Crimp terminations are preferred because they are stronger in tensile strength than the conductor used and provide true electron-exchange bonding. The drawbacks are that only one conductor may be crimped in a single well and solid-conductor wire should not be crimped. Pull tests must verify crimp integrity as well as correct tooling. Crimps must be sized by conductor size vs. crimp-well size (see mili tary or commercial specification). A conductor may never be doubled over to increase its size for proper crimping.

Four types of solder terminal will normally be available (Fig. 7-69): spade, turret, solder-well, and wire-wrap post. The spade lug is preferred since its two sides and hole relieve the most strain. Shade

Wire Wrap Post

Fig. %69 Typical  so lder  t ermina l s . terminations without holes should not be used. Turrets are good for multi-conductor solder termina tion but are more susceptible to strain failure. Solder well, the standard design available in most military type pins, can be used to accommodate multi-con ductor termination, but need good strain relief and possibly potting boots to ensure fatigue life. Wire wrap posts should only be used with solid conduc tors, with minimum of four wraps on each post. It should be noted, however,  that solder terminals should be avoided if possible.

Contact insertion and extraction Contacts must be inser ted  using only the a p p r o v e d  tool. Unapproved or wrong-size tools will cause grommet damage and destroy sealing. All contacts must be in serted into the connector (used or unused contacts). Unused contacts should have sealing plugs inserted behind the contact; test done with a proper tool after insertion to verify seating of the contact; contacts ex tracted using an approved tool. Unapproved or wrong-size tools will cause grommet failure and seal damage. Special tools are required to remove con tacts from unused holes.

Specialized hardware In most  applications, hardware must be added to protect harness and con nector. Protective caps, strain reliefs, and backshells all must be checked for compatibility. Shrink sleev ing, strain-relief boots, and part-number tags must be added in proper order and be made of pliable mate rials. All end-points must have a readable reference designator tag. Other special hardware may be addedDEMI backshells, potting boots, etc.

Redundancy Redundant signals should always be carried through separate harnesses and separate primary connectors. A good block diagram will al ways show single-point failure areas which negate re dundancy principles.

Identification methodology. There are two types of identification methodo logy- - sys tem style and assembly style. System identification uses dis tinct reference designation (REF DES) for each inter connection. The REF DES is broken into two parts, class letter and unique numeral (for example, J78). The class letter (per ANSI Y 32,2) is usually "P" for plugs or movable  connector  and "J" for jack/
receptacle or more-primary (closer-to-source) mov able connector. P&J should not be confused with pins and sockets, which do not influence reference designations. The numeric identifier is individually numbered. Numbers should not be used twice or reused if a REF DES is cancelled. In system method ology all P&J prefixes may or may not match the mating-connector reference designator. When using system identification, a permanent log must be kept with the system to assign REF DES, to prevent errors, and to assign future REF DES.

In assembly-style methodology, each assembly will have its own series of REF designators starting with numeral one. Each connector will have a unique numeral regardless of prefix (for example: J1, P2, J3, J4, P5, etc.). Most organizations prefer assembly style to identify connections.

H a r n e s s  types. Conventional harnesses are used in areas that are not usually vital to engine function. Most expendable engines use conventional harnesses because of cost-effectiveness and ease of fabrication. Conventional harnesses are constructed of insulated conductors in braided shielded cable available in groups of 1,2,3,5, etc., with 2 and 3 being most common. Conductor groups are laced together with twine or sleeving and terminated in normal strain-reliefs or backshells.

Coax harnesses serve all kinds of high-frequency data cabling. Normally they are connected to accelerometers and high-frequency pressure trans ducers. Coax cabling is available in two forms, rigid and flex, the more common being flex. Normally, low-noise coax will be the common flex form. It is almost always triaxial-type cable, constructed with two outer conductors in common to attenuate noise. Coax harnesses can be point-to-point or ganged into a common connector/harness configuration.

S p e c i a l i z e d  h a r n e s s e s .  Harsh environments may include water or salt spray/ice, vibration, hot or cold working- tempera ture ,  high electrical loads, dynamic movements,  high "delta" temperature over working temperature, and harsh or hazardous working medias. It is the designers responsibility to de termine the extent of the working environment and choose suitable hardware (Fig. 7-70).

Armored harnesses Armored braided harnesses provide lightning protection and allow an engine system to shut down in the event of a failure/fire. An armour harness must survive a fire that is present in a reducing environment  (oxidizer rich). Armored harnesses are usually constructed with multiple layers of braided sheath, with the outer braid typically made of Inconel and the inner braids of stainless steel and/or copper (with nickel plate).

Lightning harnesses. Lightning braid, on the other hand, is used to prevent lightning strikes on the engine or vehicle from affecting engine function A good rule of thumb is to carry the impulse to ground as soon as possible. Lightning protection should conform to MIL-B-5087 or other specifications.

H a r n e s s  c o n s t r u c t i o n  m e t h o d s .  Most harnesses are made on a wire board created on the basis of the wiring document (usually assy drawing). A good assembly drawing will show branch points with clocking (if none specified, it will be constructed as drawn) and the connector  clocking (if none shown, it will be 12:00 to master keyway) so that the wire board will be made correctly.

Mockup hardware should imitate the final prod uct, ordinarily using rope of the same approximate OD, but sometimes cable for more complex mock ups. Mockups should have realistic tolerances and dimensions from connector face-to-face. Also, when locating branch points, short branch points (break out before intended branching point) will be prefer able to long ones since long branch points will cause the harness to double back on itself.

Splicing should be avoided in harnessing. Splices should be crimp splices with shrink-sleeving covers. Sleeving should be multi-layered dual wall under flexible single wall for moisture protection. When splicing conductors in a leg or run, the entire area should be covered with a separate shrink sleev ing to provide strain relief. Individual splices must be clamped to prevent tensile loads from pulling on the splice.

Connector mating. Circular connectors should be mated and torqued down according to the connector  series. Before mating, threaded con nectors should be inspected for cleanliness, bent pins, deplated contacts, and corrosion. Ionized air should be blown on each connector face. If ionized air is not available, clean gaseous nitrogen should be used. Torquing should be performed with strap wrench and torque wrench.

Bayonet connectors should be inspected, air gunned, and then installed by hand until clicked into position. Use turning to demate the connectors. Inspect and install the protective cap on the mating connectors.

Coax connectors should be inspected, air-gunned, installed, torqued, and then potted to keep out mois ture and lock the connector. Potting needs to be re moved for demating. Remove the connector, in spect, and cap.

The early rocket engine might have been compared to the carbureted internal-combustion engine in that mixture ratio was controlled by orificed openings and control sequences were programmed by a pres sure-ladder process. As engine complexity evolved, the control sequencing became more critical and a rudimentary control unit, the relay controller, came into use. Two significant changes in the SSME made the electronic controller a necessity. The first in volved achieving the required performance by means of closed-loop control and safety monitoring of critical parameters. To do this and optimize start, run, and stop sequences, as well as manage redun dancy and accommodate changes, the general-puro



274 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES pose computer was essential. The second significant change was the concept of a reusable engine. This required measurement, processing, and recording of data relevant to health of the engine so that its con dition could be determined before the next flight.

Requirements Def'mition

The foremost requirements for a control system are reliability, response, accuracy, and stability. The pre liminary design of the engine determines what must be controlled, how it is to be controlled, and control accuracy. As the engine design progresses into the detail phase, the number  of sensors and control valves will be further defined. From this, an engine to-controller interface can be defined and initial pro cessing requirements established. After initial sizing of the hardware, a preliminary reliability analysis de termines the required redundancy  to achieve the mission goal. The requirements can be divided into four areas: converting sensor inputs to a usable form, processing sensor data to perform safety monitoring and process control, convert ing computed results into a form suitable for driving the necessary effec tors, and performing necessary prelaunch and in flight tests to ensure safe engine operation.

Sensor-Input Requirements

Parameters that must be monitored include combus tion temperatures,  fuel and oxygen temperatures, combustion chamber and pump  pressures, valve po sitions, pump speed and flow, and engine vibration. Resistance temperature devices (RTDs) and thermo couples will usually be employed to measure temper atures. For each temperature to be measured, the type of device must be determined, and required re sponse times, device impedance,  accuracy, and the maximum and minimum temperature range must be defined.  Calibration and linearity characteristics must also be specified.

The principal type of pressure sensor em p loyed- -a  strain-gage unit connected in a balanced bridge configuration (see Fig. 7-61 in section 7.3)- must  have specified its characteristics such as impedance, frequency response,  excitation voltage, voltage sensitivity (in volts per unit of pressure), and maximum and minimum pressure ranges as well as calibration requirements.

Typical instruments for measuring speed and flow use a moving ferromagnetic-pole piece and pickup coil to sense shaft rotation (of either the pump shaft or f low-measuring turbine shaft). A counter circuit measures the interval between succes sive pulses. Electrical characteristics such as coil re sistance, inductance, output voltage versus frequency, and the maximum and minimum frequency range to be measured are also considered. One often-used testing technique employs a second coil that is in ductively coupled to the primary coil, which in turn applies a test frequency to the primary coil. This signal is then measured through the pulse-interval counter and verified. Where two coils are provided for redundancy, the test signals can be cross-coupled.

The position of the main fuel and oxidizer valves, as well as valves used for thrust and mixture-ratio control, must be measured accurately to ensure proper engine performance. The position of other valves (such as anti-flood and bleed valves) must be known to determine whether the engine can be safely operated. For valve-position sensing, the rocket-en gine control will employ the rotary variable differen tial transformer (RVDT) for measuring angular mo tion and the linear variable differential transformer
(LVDT) for measuring linear travel. Optical en coders and ratiometric techniques, such as the track ing resolver-to-digital converter, offer better accuracy and should be specified in new valve designs. Parameters that should be specified are minimum and maximum values of position to be measured, resolution, accuracy, and excitation source (if re quired). Techniques that are sensitive to cable length or capacitance should be avoided. For on-off indica tions, the LVDT has been employed instead of limit switches because of the unreliability of switches in the rocket-engine environment. New proximity switches that use magnetic or capacitive effects offer adequate accuracy with lower cost but are as yet unproven in the rocket-engine environment.

The reusable rocket engine has made it necessary to monitor vibration during flight to detect bearing wear or failure. Radial accelerometers located on the pumps are fed to bandpass amplifiers that record the real-time signal on tape for postflight analysis; if re quired, the rms value of the vibration will be avail able as an engine-shutdown control (redline). The requirement to protect the vehicle from the effects of bearing failure is leading to the development of new bearing-wear detectors and use of real-time tracking filters to provide precise vibration data. Parameters that should be specified include frequency range of interest, signal-processing bandwidth and range, and a complete definition of vibration amplitude over the entire frequency range that the transducer is ca pable of detecting. Piezoelectric accelerometers are capable of outputting signals in the high-frequency range up to 5000 g. Electronics must be designed to filter and amplify without signal distortion. To min imize the effects of random vibration, a narrow-band tracking filter should be employed that can measure synchronous or harmonic vibration only. Accuracy and response time need to be specified.

Certain general requirements apply to all sen sors: tolerance to faults (such as open or shorted connections),  sensitivity to electrostatic discharge, and protection from electromagnetic interference
(EMI). Interface design should prevent any external failure from causing an in-range parameter failure. Sensor lines coming into the controller should have EMI filters to prevent radiation from within the con troller as well as entry of external EMI and electro static charges. (See section 7.3 for a more detailed discussion of engine instrumentation.)

Data-processing Requirements

Determin ing  the da ta-process ing  requ i rements necessitates an assessment of the tasks necessary to control the engine.  That calls for an in-depth



C O N T R O L  AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 275

analysis of the engine operation. The following task list illustrates the approach:

 Sensor processing requirements can be esti mated from the engine measurements  list. Pro cessing tasks for sensors include a reasonableness test, comparison to other sensors, curve fitting, scal ing to engineering units, and reporting the data to a health-monitoring system.

 Control process ing  requ i rements  include redline monitoring, control of thrust and mixture ra tio, and receipt and acknowledgment  of vehicle commands. Algorithms should be developed and processing requirements should be estimated from them. A state table should be maintained that de fines engine and controller status. During prelaunch, launch, and postlaunch activities.

 Control of output devices requires command output and verification that the device responded.

 Continual self-testing of the controller must verify that input and output data paths are function ing correctly. The processors themselves must be tested, either by doing a preprogrammed problem with known answers or by some other technique such as parallel processors that compare computed re suits. Redundancy management of the controller and engine resources requires maintaining a fault table. The complexity of the fault table can affect process ing requirements and execution time dramatically. Typical software requirements for redundancy man agement exceed those required for control. After the tasks are defined, an estimate of processing time can be made. Experience from similar programs can be used, and representative tasks can be coded and then extrapolated to the total requirements. Because of the uncertainty of the process, a safety factor of two or more is prudent.

Control of  Effectors

The engine is controlled simply by the opening and closing of valves: for control of flow paths, solenoid on-off valves; for engine performance, proportional valves controlled by several methods.  In one method in current use, an electrical current controls the flow of fluid in a hydraulic servovalve. The hy draulic circuit has power amplification to drive the valve. Position feedback to the electrical circuit al lows closed-loop control of commanded valve posi tion. (See section 7.2 for a more detailed discussion of engine valves.)

Proportional and on-off valves both employ in ductive coils for control, but the resistive and induc tive characteristics of the solenoids must be defined. The power levels required to activate the coils and the response time for each valve must also be deter mined. Power levels should be kept as low as practi cal and where practical, should use existing voltage forms. Solenoids and drivers must be designed with built-in fault detection that monitors solenoid voltage and/or current. Solenoid drivers should be designed to give high-side switching and to withstand shorts to ground or other voltages in the harness without over stress. The driver circuits should be unconditionally stable for any load impedance. EMI filters should be provided on each output line, and self-induced volt ages in the solenoid should be suppressed at the out put loads of the inductor to prevent spark-gap emis sions from intermittent cables.

Engine and Control ler Self-test

To reduce prelaunch checkout time and to perform health monitoring, self-test capability must be de signed into the controller, sensors, and effectors. All functional elements such as analog-to-digital con verters, digital-to-analog converters, effector drivers, computers, and memories must be verified as func tioning before launch and periodically checked dur ing flight. All analog and digital data-paths should be checked in the same manner by monitoring trans fer of known data through each path.

For each element required in real-time engine control, a watchdog timer monitors the control func tion and has the ability to switch to the backup con trol after a failure. Where redundant  elements or backup functions such as watchdog timers are re quired, all elements must be verified as functional be fore a launch. Controller circuits calibrate pressure and temperature sensors and verify sensor continuity for voltage-source devices such as speed or flow components.

Before launch, software-controlled automated checkout will be required on engine and control components to ensure a successful mission. Control valves, sensors, and the electronic controller must be exercised in a mode that simulates flight. Control valves should be opened and closed with response checks in the controller. Sensor accuracy should be verified at ambient conditions and at simulated near full-scale readings. All controller interface circuits must be verified to be operating properly, and all re dundant elements of the controller must be verified as functional; likewise, all circuitry required to per form self-test, such as data comparators, watchdog timers, and self-generated test signals.

Because it is not possible to perform self-tests on sensors and valves during flight without interrupting their control function, other techniques must be used.
"Reasonableness" testing of all sensors is currently employed; for example, during main-stage engine operation, an abnormally low or high chamber-pres sure reading would indicate that the sensor or sensor interface circuit had failed. Choosing the limits for a reasonableness test requires analysis and historical data evaluations. Future engine-control-system de signs may incorporate mathematical models of en gine performance to predict all measured parameters and to monitor engine performance more closely.

Environmenta l  Requirements

The requirements imposed upon rocket-engine elec tronics are unique: vibration levels may be 100 g or greater across a wide range of frequencies, tempera tures may go below -55"C, or above 100"C, and the environment may be saturated with water. Of course, it is necessary to protect electronics from these ex tremes. Hardware that cannot be designed to with stand these environments must be enclosed in her


276 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES metically sealed containers and mounted on vibra tion isolators. Because both heating and cooling may be required at different phases of engine operation, all controls are centrally located in a single unit to minimize the cost and weight penalties of providing isolation from the environment.  The advent of highly integrated electronics offers the possibility of locating circuits such as valve drivers and sensor processors directly on the component  to save har ness weight and cost; but the environmental concerns must be addressed as a design trade-off.

Vehicle  Interface

Engine interface with the vehicle consists of com mands such as start, stop, and thrust-level changes, as well as heal th-monitoring data sent back to it. Certain data such as engine commands,  critical to operation, are encoded in some form of error-check ing code. The SSME makes use of Bose, Chaudhuri, and Hocqeuenghem (BCH) polynomial encoding for command  data transmission. Heal th-monitor ing data that are not mission-critical may be transmitted with no more than parity-bit encoding, but any data transmitted in a noisy environment or through the a tmosphere  requires some level of encoding to achieve an acceptable reliability.

In addition, multiple sets of command lines are necessary to maintain engine control after one or more data-transmission failures. A typical system would employ three command lines and remain fully operational after one data-path failure. Response af ter the second failure would depend on the nature of the failure and criticality of the command data.

Additional interfaces such as power and cooling may be required and should be defined with the same care. For example, for power, maximum and minimum voltages under all operating conditions, conditions for power loss, transient response, and power requirements should be defined.

Control ler  Architecture

The design of a high-performance engine such as the SSME required precise control of start sequences, thrust, and mixture ratio, which could only be real ized with an electronic control system. Fuel and oxy gen flow, pressure and temperature, must be mea sured and in many cases averaged or compared with other similar measurements for additional resolution. This requires the use of high-speed, precision analog measurement circuits and a digital computer to pro cess measurement data. The computer will also pro vide mixture-ratio and thrust control and manage ment of self-test and redundancy. The identification of these requirements and their breakdown by task description mark the first steps in defining a hard ware configuration (or architecture) to accomplish the task.

Function Allocation

Controller functions can be divided into three areas
(Fig. 7-71): input of engine sensor data (input electronics), processing of data (digital computer), and control of engine valves (output electronics). The interface between the engine sensors and the controller forms part of the input electronics (IE). Temperature sensors include thermocouples (TCs)
and resistance temperature devices (RTDs).

Each RTD needs a bridge termination network with noise filtering, and each TC requires additional gain. These RTD or TC outputs must be converted from analog to digital for use by a digital computer, and there are numerous approaches to performing this conversion. Figure 7-72 shows one approach:
conditioning all temperature and pressure signals and multiplexing them onto a single analog-data bus, and thence converting them to a digital value for data processing. This approach features minimum hardware but imposes high-frequency response re quirements on the multiplexing and analog-to-digital
(A-D) converters. Pulse-interval counters measure the period of the speed and flow waveforms. The pe riod is then converted to a flowrate in the computer. Other functions include sensor testing and calibra tion, which are controlled by the computer as part of preflight testing.

Engine data require a variety of operations for control and monitoring:

 Comparison of engine parameters to stored data for reasonableness as a sensor fault-detection technique.

 Comparison against stored data that define safe operating limits.

 Conversion of all input data into engineering units for recording and/or real-time display.

 Solution of all control equations related to engine control.

 Communication to and from the vehicle.
 Verification that engine components  respond to commanded inputs, valve position, etc.
 Scheduling of input, computation, and output within the controller sampling-cycle. These tasks can be performed by a general-pur pose digital computer. Its design should be based on the data-processing needs identified in the require ments analysis, but the nature of the computing task should also be considered. For example, since the dynamic range of sensor and control-output data will be limited, fixed-point data processing proves ade quate and results in a faster and less-complex com puter than a floating-point machine. Should a single, powerful processor perform every task or multiple processors share a task? Because of the micropro cessor, distribution of the processing task may now be the preferred method. Should special-purpose data buses be tailored to the specific needs of this controller or industry standard buses employed? The tradeoffs are lower performance and additional hardware  if industry s tandard buses are used. However, the flexibility to incorporate new functions in the future may offset the disadvantages of a stan dard bus. The selection and sizing of the memory should also relate to the system-requirements analy sis and support the necessary data-processing rates. Issues that must be considered are memory volatility, data integrity, and size.

As to the valve-control driver circuits, valve and valve-driver design will be affected by response time, power  levels, electromagnetic noise, and reliability. Since a valve that uses low power has high inductance and, therefore, poor response time, a tradeoff must be made between response time and power level. To minimize system-interconnect  noise, power  and ground circuits associated with valve drivers should be isolated from the input and computer electronics. Where high current levels are employed, such as in motor-driven valves, the power  electronics may be collocated with the motor. The goal of valve and valve-driver design should be to use standard voltage forms wherever possible on the vehicle. Monitoring the valves for confirmation that the command was executed should also be done in the output-electron ics area. Monitoring of voltage and current for each valve can check for associated open and shorted ca bles. Valve position must be monitored to verify that the valve has responded to the command.

The selection of a system architecture, then, be comes a series of tradeoffs featuring cost, weight, per formance, and reliability as the principal factors. For example, whether a motor driver circuit is located on the motor or in the controller chassis would deter mine environment (vibration and temperature), har ness design, and packaging design in addition to electrical design considerations.

Failure Detection and Response

Because failures in electronic hardware are random, the minimum requirement for fault tolerance is to be operational after the first failure and to shut the en gine down safely after the second failure (fail-op; fail safe). The first problem is to detect when a failure has occurred and the second is to be able to switch control of the engine to the backup hardware. Of the many approaches to fault detection, two representa tive selections are discussed here.

The first approach has been used on the SSME~
diagnostic testing by built-in-test (BIT) hardware. Sensors are tested by switching in a BIT signal that simulates an input. Analog circuits are tested by in serting precision test voltages in the analog-data path and checking for correct analog-to-digital conver sion. Digital-data paths are exercised by transmitting known data patterns and checking for proper data transfer. Digital computers can be checked by a se ries of operations to verify correct arithmetic and data-transfer operations. When a microprocessor is used, it is not possible to predict the scope of fault coverage of self-test software. Therefore, a scheme employed in a number  of high-reliability applica tions uses self-checking processor pairs. Two identi cal microprocessors are operated in lockstep and their output compared on a bit-by-bit basis. Data sent from one unit to another can be looped back to the sending unit for verification.

Valve-driver response can be checked by measur ing coil voltage and current and by monitoring the valve position. The portion of failures that can be detected in this manner is referred to as fau l t  cover age, and it is critical to mission success.

A second approach employs multiple channels of independent hardware to solve the problem and then compare the answers. If an output is incorrect, switching logic prevents that channel from control ling the engine. This approach can provide 100%
fault coverage for all the controller electronics ex cept the output comparator  and switching logic. Multiple comparators and redundant switching logic can circumvent these problems.

The second part of the problem involves switch ing control from a failed unit to any unit still operat ing properly. For most failures, the built-in selftest hardware detects the problem and the unit takes itself out of service. A minority of failures cannot be self diagnosed; for example, if the processor should halt, it can no longer control the engine and, in addition, cannot relinquish control.

Figure 7-73 illustrates one method for switching control. Both channels can control the valve, but

Output-electronics redundancy



278 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES channel 2 has an additional control coil that, when enabled, allows the channel 2 valve driver to control the valve. In one servoactuator design, each control coil modulates an independent hydraulic circuit and the channel-enable coil selects which of the two inde pendent circuits is active. For the design shown in Fig. 7-73, if channel 1 detects a failure, it would force a time-out of the watchdog timer, allowing channel 2
to assume control. If channel 1 halted, no channel 1
updates would be received by the watchdog timer, which would allow channel 2 to assume control by default. This diagram, a simplistic concept of only one redundancy management scheme, only serves to illustrate the principle.

Finally, as part of the design process, a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) would be con ducted to determine if the design contains unde tected failures, improper failure responses, or single point failure modes.

Hardware Design Rules

The following guidelines are to be used for ana log-digital circuit design, EMC/EMI requirements, component  placement,  standard-parts usage, and component  derating.

Analog-design guidelines. The guidelines for analog-circuit design can be divided into four areas of concern: verifying that the circuit meets require ments by using a circuit-analysis program such as SPICE; selectiing parts whose parameters permit the circuit to perform over the environment and life of the unit; derating component  parameters to ensure the reliability of the circuit; and seeing that the pack aging and layout constraints of decoupling, signal routing, and component placement retain the perfor mance inherent in the design. These design steps should be followed:

1) Select a circuit topology (mechanizat ion)
that performs the required function with minimum error sources and minimum number of parts.

2) Select parts, considering standard parts, part availability (qualified parts lists, STD-Parts list, multiple sources), stress, and parameter stabilitymini tial tolerance, temperature, and time stability.

3) Analytically determine that the circuit re quirements meet design centering and worst-case conditions as a design goal. Root-sum squared (rss)
analysis should be used only on circuits unable to meet worst-case conditions. Breadboard, brassboard, or prototype tests should be used to show that the circuit requirements will be met under temperature extremes and power-supply variations.

4) Consider mechanical constraints, including power dissipation, grounding/shielding, signal rout ing, and error coupling (component placement).

Digital-design guidelines. The ground rules to control the digital logic design cover fan-out, propa gation delays, termination, unused logic gates and pins, component  and board decoupling, signal line lengths, and multiple-loaded signal paths for various logic elements.

Propagation-delay calculations. A worst case timing consideration of logic implementation is nec essary to ensure that adequate timing margins exist in the design. In addition to intrinsic propagation delay of a logic device, other timing delay contributors must be included in the analysis. These contributors account for the effects of voltage, temperature, aging, external loading, and interconnect media. For high speed devices with subnanosecond delays, it is neces sary to treat most circuit paths as transmission lines.

Digital interfaces. The quality of digital sig nals and system noise generated by signal distortions should be considered in the design, interconnection, and physical layout of digital elements. To ensure that the desired signal characteristics are achieved, the following should be given consideration:

 Interface line impedance and various discon tinuities.

 Source- and load-impedance management to control reflection on lines.

 Electrical line lengths and relationship to signal rise/fall time.

 Configuration of multiple-load connections.
 Separation and parallel run length of adjacent signal paths. Unused gates and pins. Unused logic gates

(spares) should be forced into their lowest power-dis sipation state by grounding or pulling up their inputs. Of unused input pins on logic gates, those required to be logically low must be grounded, and those re quired to be logically high must be returned to 5 Vdc through a pull-up resistor.

DecoupUng. The following procedure will de couple simultaneously digital logic components and logic boards: For low-frequency board decoupling, each printed wiring board (PWB) uses one 15-~F +/ 20%, 30-V tantalum capacitor, CLR79 type, located near the main connector. For high-frequency board and component  decoupling, CKR05 or CKR22 ce ramic capacitors are distributed around the board. For each group of logic or digital elements, the amount of capacitance follows this rule: a minimum of 0.20 mF of capacitance for every group of ele ments totaling a change in power  supply current
(state to state) of 100 mA.

EMI/EMC design guidelines. The most impor tant step in achieving electromagnetic compatibility will be to define the EMC system, that is, decide how to separate electrically noise from electrically sensi tive areas and where to put EMI filters and shields. The Space Shuttle main engine controller (SSMEC), a complex system, employs high-level transient output signals, low-level analog input signals, high-speed dig ital signals, and a complex, multi-output power sup ply. In general concept, the SSMEC should enclose the circuitry in a metal box with the power supply isolated in a separate compartment within the box, and the EMI filters should be placed on power-supply inputs and outputs, noisy boards, physically sepa rated from sensitive boards and high-level and low level signals routed separately.

The power supply should be isolated in a sepa rate compartment with prime power entry on one side of the compartment through bulkhead-mounted



CONTROL AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 279

EMI filters. Power-supply outputs should be routed through bulkhead-mounted EMI filters on another power-supply wall. Output signal cables, digital-signal cables, and input analog-signal cables should be physically separated and should not have shields terminated at the same point. Back-plane intercon nects should be via multilayer boards. If wire wrap is used, sensitive signals should be placed in the first two layers adjacent to the ground plane, with the less critical signals further away.

M e c h a n i c a l  c o n s i d e r a t i o n s .  The SSMEC must be electromagnetically compatible with the remain der of the Shuttle. To this end, the integrated EMC design requires that the metal box or cabinet housing the SSMEC circuitry provide on the order of 60-dB attenuation of electromagnetic fields over the fre quency range of 14 kHz to 1 G Hz. This is not difficult to achieve with any of the common aluminum alloys. Thickness of the material is not critical, since thick ness is usually driven by structural requirements rather the EMI requirements and any thickness greater than about 0.020 in. is satisfactory for EMI protection.

Particular attention must be paid to seams and joints in the areas of fastener spacing, material finish, and joint evenness to prevent unacceptable degrada tion of attenuation. All metal structural parts should be electrically bonded together and ultimately to the housing ground-lug. Small covers should be bonded with silver-filled silicone rubber radio-frequency-in terference (RFI) gaskets to avoid bowing of joints.

P o w e r  d i s t r i b u t i o n  a n d  grounding. Prime power  should be brought into the power-supply compartment through tubular bulkhead-mounted EMI filters. If the power cable passes through the con troller before going through the EMI filters, it must be shielded. A "doghouse" is preferred for power en try; that is, a small enclosure is used to mount the power connector on the outside of the controller housing so that the EMI filters are outside of the con troller.

Both the high- and return-power lines must be isolated from the chassis and signals made common within the controller. Transformer isolation is pre ferred, even on dc power lines. In this case, the dc is chopped  before application to the transformer. Providing a control signal across the transformer, if necessary, will best be done with fiber-optic tech niques or transformer coupling.

Secondary power should be distributed on fiat planes placed adjacent to power/signal  common planes. Power connections to digital-logic PWB should be made by multiple pins spaced across the connector. Output-electronics (OE) driver power should be carried to the OE PWB by twisted pairs. If made through multilayer boards, power and returns must be routed together and carried through connec tors on adjacent pins. OE power returns/common should be connected to logic common or analog common only on the OE PWB. Input electronics
(IE) power/signal common should be connected to logic common only on a PWB.

I n t e r c o n n e c t s .  Printed wiring boards should have multilayer construction with no more than two signal layers between ground planes. As a design goal, PWB paths should have a characteristic impedance of 50-75 L. PWB-to-PWB signal paths should tend toward 50 L to minimize cross-coupling. PWB-to-outside-world signal paths should tend to ward 75 L to minimize reflections. On a logic PWB, parallel paths should be limited to minimize crosstalk.

Thermal overlays should be isolated from signal common on PWB. Provisions should be made for grounding the thermal overlays to the chassis, where the overlays are clamped to the chassis sidewalls, so that the overlays function as shields.

Clock signals should be routed only where abso lutely necessary and should be distributed at as low a frequency as possible. Clock lines should not be routed around the edge of a PWB and should not go off of a PWB if at all possible. Clocks leaving the daughter board should be distributed differentially, and clock signal paths should be surrounded by grounds (signal common) on both sides, top and bottom. Cables should be as short as possible and yet consistent with maintainability. Digital signals may be routed on etched flex tapes with ground planes above and below.

Postt~ght Data Analysis

An essential development  requirement will be to measure parametric data for determination of engine performance. Typical required measurements in clude vibration, pressure,  temperature,  turbine speeds, fuel and oxidizer flow rates, and valve posi tions. Engine design parameters such as thrust and flow rates must  be verified by engine testing. Temperature and pressure measurements must be taken to confirm design safety-margins. These mea surements will first be made during engine-develop ment ground testing and become a set of baseline data that define nominal engine-operating parame ters.

Measurement of various engine temperatures en sures that cryogenic propellants are not leaking into the engine, subjecting its components to temperature overexposure. During engine start and shutdown, turbine temperatures, speeds, and pressures indicate whether transients have damaged engine compo nents. Rotor unbalance, bearing wear, and pump-in let cavitation can be evaluated from vibration mea surement.

For the case of the expendable rocket engine, these measurements were of primary importance dur ing development and acceptance testing of the flight hardware. Many of the measurements were of sec ondary importance during flight in determining causes of failure. However, the amount of data taken during flight was limited by how much data could be downlinked from the vehicle.

The advent of the reusable rocket engine, how ever, required acquisition of data that can indicate hardware conditions during operation. The engine controller for a reuseable engine must measure, pro cess, and report engine data. As each engine builds operating time, a database is established. After each



280 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES engine run, the data are examined by each discipline within the engine team and a data review made be fore the engine is flown again. The instrumentation group examines the data for indications of sensor or sensor-processing failures. Most instrumentation failures are usually caused by shorted or open con nections in the harness or sensor, and these can be detected by tests performed automatically by  the electronics. However, intermittent or parameter-shift failure may require more analysis. The data-analysis group, using statistical analysis, compares the most recent run to the existing database and identifies components that may be indicating premature fail ure. Long-term trends sometimes indicate more sub tle failure modes. Research on the SSME indicates that these long-term trends exist and suggests that additional data taken during flight may reduce flight turnaround-time through more accurate prediction of component failure.

Software Requirements

When the electronic controller was introduced to pace and monitor the engine operation, software be came an important element in rocket-engine control, supporting optimum engine performance, safety and health monitoring, redundancy management, etc. It enables the controller to use many complex control algorithms and a close monitoring scheme. For a reusable engine, the historical data can be used for the next flight as well as real-time health monitoring.

The beginning of the engine-controller design process sees software requirements defined as one of the controller components. Hardware/software trade studies determine the best balance to meet the fun damental control-system requirements, including functional performance, reliability, accuracy, and stability. In addition to the hardware interface, the software requirements normally include the following areas: engine control requirements, engine and con troller performance and status monitoring, failure de tection and recovery, and communication and data gathering requirements.

Engine control .  One of the primary functions of the software, engine control, will be based on the overall engine-performance requirements. Software may be used in both open-loop and closed-loop control. In future systems, adaptive control will be made possible with advanced software architecture in the control loop.

During control-algorithm development, a com puter program simulates control models to deter mine necessary sensor data, actuator output, and other engine parameters. These parameters, along with the control algorithm, will be included in the
_software functional requirements.

Engine control includes start, run, and stop phases with engine-thrust, propellant-mixture, and igniter-control outputs. The control requirements also include timing requirements of the control loop, startup sequence, shutdown sequence, and post-shut down operation.

Engine a n d  con t ro l l e r  p e r f o r m a n c e  a n d s ta tus  moni tor ing.  The software performs various checks, validation, and monitoring before, during, and after engine operation to determine status and performance of the engine and the controller hard ware. These operations normally include the follow ing items: controller self-test, sensor validation, sen sor check and monitoring, valve monitoring, engine ready and ignition monitoring, actuator and pneu matic checkout, communication check and monitor ing, and power-supply check and monitoring.

Fai lure  de tec t ion  a n d  r e c o v e r y .  Software monitoring and controlling of the engine makes pos sible early detection of failure and smooth switching to an alternate component. The software may com pensate for temporary hardware errors and some hardware degradation to support safe operation. Certain critical parameters must be monitored to be within specified limits (redlines) to ensure engine, vehicle, and mission safety. These parameters, which are determined by the type of engine, controller, and vehicle, normally include main combustion pressure, turbine-discharge temperatures,  turbopump-seal purge pressures, turbopump coolant-liner pressures, preburner purge pressures, and pump-vibration sen sors. The software should also include failure-mode analysis and diagnostic routines to determine the cause of failures.

Communica t ion .  The processor communicates with the vehicle to accept commands and report en gine and controller status. This communication de pends on the amount of data traffic and response time requirements. Reliability of the communication link is just as important as any other part of the sys tem. Communication protocol and error-detection and recovery methods will be part of these require ments.

Data  ga ther ing .  Software will gather pertinent data for use in postflight analysis and health moni toring. These data are especially useful for reusable engines, new engine design, and improvements in ex isting engine designs.

Fault  to lerance .  The system requires at least fail-operational/fail-safe operation, which includes redundancy management, tolerance of hardware degradation, and recovery from temporary errors. If the controller is used for critical operation, software redundancy should also be considered to detect any bugs.

S o f t w a r e  a r c h i t e c t u r e .  Primarily the engine controller controls and monitors the engine within specified times required in its operation. To be effi cient, the software structure must reflect this real-time requirement. The architecture design must also con sider software-development efficiency, which affects software integrity, maintenance, cost of development, expansibility, and reusability.

Real-time operating systems are more flexible and easier to use both for run-time system and soft ware development. However, the resulting software programs tend to be larger than other architectures.
"Real-time executive," an efficient run-time system, requires careful planning and design to be flexible and maintainable. The software development re quires another operating system or compatible de velopment environment.

Embedded software, a customized architecture, yields the most efficient run-time program for the



C O N T R O L  AND C O N D I T I O N - M O N I T O R I N G  SYSTEMS 281

real-time system. It is the most time-consuming sys tem to develop and is not easy to maintain without careful planning and a well-structured development methodology.

Multitasking operations will be determined at the time of requirements definition. Number of tasks, re sponse time, interrupts, and task priorities, among other factors, affect the decision.

Software development. Although not a large scale task, development of the engine-controller soft ware will be a complicated and critical operation. Success demands proper design methodology along with efficient project management.

Design methodology. Engine system design will see many requirement changes and improve ments. The popular waterfall method is not well suited for changing requirements or design. The fol lowing three methods best suit this design task:

Incremental. The incremental method, a varia tion of the waterfall method, may be applicable if the requirements are fairly well established. The software is divided into a number of modules of manageable size and is designed one module at a time. Since each module is small, normal changes are easily ac commodated.

Evolutionary. The evolutionary method can be used when the major requirements are known. The design starts with only the major requirements im plemented and evolves to the final configuration. For the engine-controller software, normally the ma jor requirements will be known and the refinements may change from time to time. This methodology well suits this type of software.

Prototyping. The prototyping method is best used when the customer says, "I know what I want when I see it." It develops functional elements closest to the estimated requirements as a feasibility model and evaluates this prototype to generate prototype requirements. The process is repeated until the final requirements are established. This process creates a product most desirable for the system; but it can be very time-consuming and costly.

Design tools. Establishing the software-devel opment environment entails the greatest capital in vestment in this area. It must be carefully chosen so that proper software tools will be available for design. Computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools can facilitate this work throughoutmfrom require ment analysis, software design, and design analysis to all documentation and the configuration manage ment.

Design language. Selection of design language or method will reflect the software complexity and coding requirements. Figure 7-74 graphically repre sents the control flow of the program. This type of detailed design is easy to code and modify; but data flow can not easily be shown in the computer-gener ated diagram and documentation. Using the com puter for graphical design is cumbersome compared to the program design language (PDL), as shown in Fig. 7-75. Many other types of graphic software de sign charts are available with CASE tools. PDL offers the advantages of ease of writing the detailed design and documentation on the computer, but the disad vantage that the designer tends to code in PDL, rather than concentrating on designmand that lapse may cause more design errors.

282 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Implementation language. For most of the controller software, any language may be used for implementation; but assembly language is used to code the most efficient software. The "C" language is widely used because of simplicity and flexibility. The Ada language is suited for complex software to min imize coding errors. Another disadvantage of high order language (HOL) is that compiler efficiency, in many cases, determines the code efficiency of the program. On the other hand, assembly-language programming, although complicated, produces the fastest code if programmed properly. In many case, HOL and assembly language are mixed to get the best results.

Testing. The final phase of software develop ment is testing. The software is tested as a module
(unit testing), together  with the other modules
(integration testing), and finally as a total system. The thoroughness of these tests determines the qual ity of the final product. The final test must include all real conditions such as faults and noise. Since the engine cannot be fired for all the software tests, simu lated engine tests are performed until the product is sufficiently proven. Therefore, these tests depend highly on the quality of the engine-simulation pro gram.

Independent validation and verification. Independent  validation and verification (IV&V) of software development has proven highly desirable in creating a quality software product. The IV&V pro cess may cover the entire software-development cy cle, from the requirements-analysis phase to the final test, or it may be limited to the test phase only, de pending on the criticality of the software.

Other software-design considerations. Basic software requirements for the controller will be estab lished during the initial engine-system design through a careful hardware-vs.-software tradeoff. At the time the software functions are defined, related hardware functions, inputs, and outputs must be clearly and unambiguously defined. These items in clude hardware accessibility by the software, mem ory-size limitation, communication and bus speed, data traffic, timing requirements, etc. The trade study also evaluates hardware/software efficiency in terms of size, cost, complexity, and ease of maintenance. Other software design considerations are as follows:

 Software response time to any critical event.
 Software system modularity for ease of de velopment and maintenance.
 Robustness to tolerate hardware degradation and noise and temporary errors.
 Maintainability to reduce cost of maintenance and improvements.
 Testability to improve testing and quality of the software product.
 Reusability to improve software quality and reduce development cost and time.
 Flexibility in both software structure and de sign to adapt to any engine system improvement. Summary.  The primary ingredients of any high quality software design will be the software engi neers, followed by proper development methodol ogy, efficient software tools, and software environ ment suited to the development. Since the engine controller software design requires a team effort and close coordination with hardware design, efficiency in project management greatly affects the final soft ware product.

The most important phase of the development cycle will be the requirements analysis and defini tion, followed by the testing regimen. Erroneous re quirements are the hardest to find and most costly to repair. Good documentation is another important factor in maintaining the software.

The controller software development does not different from any other software development in that it must follow good software-engineering prac tices. As critical tasks pile on the software, its quality becomes aa ever more dominant factor in the over all engine system.

D e s i g n  o f  Prope l lant  Tanks

Liquid-propellant rocket engines and propellant-feed systems form the propulsion system. Since propellant tankage and its arrangement have a large effect upon liquid propel lant  rocket engine  design and propulsion systems integration, a detailed discussion of propellant tank design is presented in this chapter. Much of the information also applies to pressurant tank design.

8.1 DESIGN CONFIGURATIONS

The configuration of propellant tanks depends largely on vehicle mission and size. In many designs, the tanks form an integral part of the vehicle structure. Propellant tanks can be nonexclusively categorized, according to vehicle application, as prepackaged storable-liquid, booster-stage, and upper-stage systems.

Prepackaged Storable-Hquid Systems

Figure 8-1 presents the configuration of a typical prepackaged storable-liquid propulsion system. The tanks, arranged in tandem, have a common bulkhead. This system is designed for long storage periods, perhaps 5 to 10 years. A main characteristic of these systems: propellants will be loaded and contained in the tanks by burst disks or isolation valves. Both the tank and containment component  construction materials must be compatible with the propellants for the storage duration. In the example, the propel lants are expelled by a pressurization gas produced by a solid-propellant gas generator. The tank walls form an integral part of the vehicle structure and are designed to withstand the internal pressure loads as well as the vehicle dynamic loads. In some designs the tanks are further stabilized by the internal pres sure against buckling; i.e., the walls are always kept un der tension loads by a specified pressure level main tained during storage and handling. In smaller units, the walls are usually capable of taking external loads without being pressurized internally. Operational tank pressures range from 400 to 2000 psia. Prepackaged storable-liquid systems are usually employed in relatively short-duration, low-thrust applications.

Booster-stage Systems

Figure 8-2 presents the propellant-tank configuration of a typical propulsion system used in the booster stages of a large launch vehicle such as the Saturn V. The system shown can be used for either storable or cryogenic propellants. The tanks, arranged in tan dem, form walls of the vehicle structure. For booster

The tanks represent a large percentage of the vehicle structural (inert) weight. Low pressure levels allow constructing the tanks with extremely thin walls. However, the often huge tank structures thus become sensitive to external buckling loads. To stabilize the tank structures of large booster-stage systems, two basic design avenues are open: pressure-stabilization and self-supporting structures. In pressure-stabilized systems, such as the Atlas ICBM, tank pressures must be constantly maintained above a specific minimum by elaborate controls. Atlas's tank structure, basically a thin-wall monocoque, requires special handling procedures. In most booster-stage systems, the pro pellant tanks are self-supporting, with tank walls rein forced by skin stringers (Fig. 8-2) or by other structural means, such as waffle-grid patterns.

Cryogenic propellants may require tank insu lation. It will be mandatory in a liquid hydrogen system to prevent ambient-air liquefaction, which causes high heat-transfer rates, with attendant high boiloff rates, and safety hazards. pellant discharge. The tanks are bolted to the shell structure around their support ring.

Many upper-stage vehicles employ a gas-pressur ized propellant feed system. Tank pressures range from 100 to 400 psia. The system shown in Fig. 8-3
uses helium gas for pressurization. The gas is stored at an initial pressure level from 4500 to 5500 psia at  300"F in two liquid-nitrogen-jacketed, high-pressure spherical tanks located between the two main propellant tanks.

The following discussion treats directly only upper-stage propulsion systems; but many of the design principles presented apply equally to booster stage tanks.

8.2 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Systems optimization within the overall vehicle design greatly influences tank design. A principal vehicle-design objective will be highest payload and/or velocity increment with maximum possible reliability. Design details depend largely upon type of propellants, mission requirement and config Uration, propulsion-system design, and available construction materials and fabrication techniques.

Upper-stage Systems

Figure 8-3 presents the propellant-tank design for a typical pressure-fed upper-stage propulsion system. An outer cylindrical shell, designed to withstand all anticipated boost and flight loads, contains the tanks. The propellant tankage consists of two individual welded aluminum-alloy tanks, modified spheres, faired into conical sections at the bottom for pro Propellant Properties

Propellants affect tank design mainly by their physical and chemical characteristics. The boiling point or storage temperature of a propellant deter mines the operating temperature range of the tank as sembly. Cryogenic propellants cause tank design problems due to thermal gradients, the need for insulation, and need for construction materials ca

The low density of some propellants, such as liquid hydrogen, necessitates tanks of considerable volume. The highly corrosive and reactive properties of other propellants severely limit the selection of tank materials.

Shape and Size o f  Propel lant  Tank

As a propellant tank, a sphere offers the smallest sur face-to-volume ratio and the smallest shell stress for a given internal pressure, but the combination of several spheres into the generally cylindrical enve lope typical for most rocket vehicles causes sizable weight and volume penalties. Furthermore, a sphere precludes use of the tank wall as a load-carrying member of the vehicle structure (Fig. 8-1 and 8-2), resulting in further weight and volume penalties.

Thus, both vehicle configuration and tank pressure will determine the shape of propellant tanks. Vehicles of relatively large length-to-diameter ratios and of limited space envelopes will use cylindrically shaped tanks. Relatively high tank pressures and less stringent space conditions may favor spherical tanks
(Fig. 8-3). The ends of cylindrical tanks can have either spherical or ellipsoidal shapes. The basic cylindrical tank with spherical ends weighs less than one with ellipsoidal ends; but overall, an ellip soidally-ended tank may weigh less owing to shorter interstage structure. In some designs, the propellant tank ends will have special shapes to accommodate structural loads, minimize residual propellants, and utilize available envelope.

The required volume of a propellant tank will be the sum of usable propellant volume and other volume requirements:

Vt = V + T + B + U (8-1)

U propellant-tank design volume, ft3

trapped-propellant volume, a function of system configuration; includes pro pellants trapped in tank and components down to the engine valves, ft3
boiled-off propellant volume (applicable only to cryogenic propellants), ft3
tank ullage volume, ft3

The calculation of propellant volume takes pro pellant density at specific temperatures. The tank ullage-volume calculations should allow for propel lant volume changes due to temperature change of the tanked propellant and for tank deformation under pressure. This is especially important for prepackaged storable-liquid systems to prevent ex cessive tank pressures when the system is exposed to a specified upper temperature limit during storage. The weight of the trapped propellant will be greatest, however, at the lowest operating temperature.

Vtf = Vf -~- Tf + Uf

= 138.2 + 1.8 + 3.5 = 143.5 ft 3 (bs-6)

Propel lant-tank Arrangement

Most vehicle systems have the propellant tanks in tandem, but other arrangements can be used for spe cific design reasons. Figure 8-4 presents various pro pellant-tank configurations for a typical vehicle system using helium for tank pressurization. A design analysis will determine the best solution for a given propellant-storage volume and vehicle envelope.

General considerations include minimum overall weight, maximum storage volume in a given enve lope, least possibility of propellant mixing, aerody namic vehicle shape, ease of installation of ducts and lines, ease of insulation, ease of fabrication and handling, and a minimum of trapped (unusable)
propellants.

Arrangement "a" in Fig. 8-4 is taken as standard. Arrangement  "b", combining tandem propel lant tanks with an integrated helium bottle in between, gives lowest weight, but poses design problems in the routing of pneumatic lines and controls. Arrange ment "c" with concentric tanks eases the installation of propellant ducts, but has the possibility of simul taneous puncture of both tanks, and subsequent mixing of the propellants. Arrangement "d" with multiple tanks has the highest weight, but is easier to fabricate and handle, especial ly for very large vehicles.

 Bending moments due to vehicle transverse accelerations, wind loads, and shifting of the center of gravity

 Aerodynamic forces

In most vehicle systems, internal tank pressure loads and axial-thrust loads are the principal ones. These and other loads require careful evaluation, including experimental testing.

Safety Factors

The r ecommended  criteria for structural loads presented in Chapter 2 (Eqs. 2-4 through 2-7)
generally apply to propellant-tank design. However, when calculating allowable operating stresses from tank internal  pressure, Military Standard MIL-STD 1522A (USAF), Standard General Requirements For Safe Design And Operation Of Pressurized Missile And Space Systems, is frequently imposed. It re quires minimum proof test and burst factors of 1.25

Material and Fabrication Considerations

In addition to considerations of propellant com patibility and operational-temperature ranges, se lection of construction materials for propellant tanks will be based on strength-to-density ratio at a given temperature and on ductility. Properties will often be specified from Military Standardization Handbook MIL-HDBK-5E, "Metallic Materials and Elements for Aerospace Vehicle Structures." For a given working pressure, the lightest tank structure will be the one made of the material with the highest ratio of ulti mate strength-to-density. The following construction materials have frequently been used for propellant tanks:

 Aluminum alloys, such as 2000 and 6000 series. Room temperature properties: average density p = 0.1
lb/in.3, Fy up to 60,000 psi, Fu up to 70,000 psi, Fu/p=
70x 104.

 Steel alloys, such as AISI 300 series, A286, 17-7
PH, PH 15-7 Mo and Inconel 718. Room temperature properties: average density p = 0.285 lb/in.3, Fy up to
200,000 psi, Fu up to 220,000 psi, Fu/p = 77.2x 104.

 Titanium alloys, such as 6AI-4V. Room tem perature properties: average density p = 0.16 lb/in.3, Fy up to 155,000 psi, Fu up to 170,000 psi, Fu/p
=106x104.

 Fi lament-wound graphite/resin composites. Room-temperature composite properties: average density p = 0.059 lb/in.3, Fu = 600,000 psi. Fu/p = 1020
x104.

Compatible with most storable and cryogenic propellants, aluminum alloys may be used for op erating temperatures up to 350F. Stainless steels and titaniums qualify for storable and cryogenic pro pellants, and can serve at higher temperatures (800F maximum). Epoxy resins used with graphite will ordinarily be limited to temperatures less than approximately 300"F, but other resins may be used up to approximately 500"F.

Fabrication methods for propellant tanks depend largely upon the type of material used. The most important considerations for tank fabrication are dimension control, heat treating, and welding. Tank stress calculations must consider the lower limit of wall-thickness variation, but the upper limit will be used for weight calculations. The strength of a metal may fall into a band, too, the variation of which depends on the heat-treating process. Stress calcu lations will be based on the minimum expected strength. The quality of the welding process or the efficiency of a welded joint may require extra wall thickness as calculated from separate operating stresses. Assuming a weld efficiency of 90-95% will be reasonable. Depending on the alloy, welds are fre quently subjected to a heat cycle to relieve residual stresses due to welding. Figure 8-5 presents the construction of a welded propellant tank. Note the segmented tank end, which is typical for large tanks.

Design Problems

Many other design and analysis problems have to be carefully considered before a successful propellant tank can be produced. The relatively thin, highly stressed shells make it difficult to attach concentrated loads. The loads must be spread out in a suitable way to prevent localized overstresses. Cryogenic propel lants may create thermal transient and gradient problems. While the empty portion of a tank may be subject to aerodynamic heating, the filled portion

PROPELLANT TANKS 291

may be at a very low temperature. Additional thermal problems may arise in outer space, such as from solar heating of one tank side and radiation cooling of the other. Other problems associated with the management  of the propellants within the tanks include uniform dispersion of the entering tank pressurant,  sensing of propellant quantities (PU), prevention of propellant sloshing, expulsion of pro pellants under adverse conditions, and fill, drain, vent, and pressure relief of the propellant tanks.

8.3 STRUCTURAL DESIGN

As a rule, the wall thickness of propellant tanks will first be calculated from stresses caused by internal pressure loads and discontinuities. Then the design will be checked for other loads. If small in thickness compared to the radii of curvature (t/r<__1/15) and offering no resistance to bending, the wall will be subjected only to direct or hoop-membrane stresses, which are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the thickness. However, any discontinuity along the wall, such as an abrupt change in radius of curvature or wall thickness, will introduce discontinuity and bending stresses. At a sufficient distance from the juncture between the tank ends and the cylindrical shell, where interaction does not occur, the max imum stress in the tank wall due to internal pressure should be calculated using the hoop-membrane stress formula only.

Figure 8-6 identifies the major tank elements. In an optimum tank design, the wall thickness varies according to a combination of local membrane, bending, and discontinuity stresses, especially for spherical and ellipsoidal tank-ends. The following methods  can be used to calculate volume, wall thickness, wall surface area, and weight of various tank shapes. The following general terminology is used:

Discontinuity stresses fade out rapidly, becoming negligibly small a short distance from the juncture. Detail analyses of discontinuity stresses can be found in standard textbooks.  In general,  buildup of wall thickness of less than 0.5 tc, near the juncture, will suffice for most  designs, with only small weight penalty.

K p t a _ 0 . 8 0 x  1 8 0 x 4 1

Some designs "save" weight  by taking advantage of the fact that the bulkhead common  to both tanks experiences a relatively small differential pressure in operation.

Axial Compressive Loading on the Cylindrical Section

In integrated propellant tank designs (Fig. 8-2 and 8 3) the cylindrical tank section must withstand large axial compressive loads during vehicle handling and operation. If the tank is not pressurized, i.e., if tank pressure = ambient pressure, the critical axial com pressive stress for an unstiffened cylindrical tank may be calculated as follows:

Sc= 9 +0 .1  \ l c J  E (8-33)

where S c = critical axial compressive stress, psi.

This is the axial compressive stress that will cause the tank to buckle.

Internal pressure can increase the axial load carrying ability of a cylindrical tank section with minimum weight penalty. This is known as pressure stabilization. Internal pressure will raise the critical buckling stress of a tank; or it may be used to counter balance an axial compressive load Fa where  F~ = lra2pt (8-34)

Pressurization will also reduce tank failures from very large bending loads. If the pressure is ever permitted to drop below a value necessary to carry the axial and bending loads, however, the tank will collapse and the vehicle will probably be damaged beyond repair.

An alternative method of increasing the external load-carrying ability of a cylindrical tank is to make it self-supporting. This involves stiffening the cylin drical skin by means of longitudinal and circum ferential members,  or honeycomb structures. The members may be either separate stiffeners welded to the tank wall, or may be made integral with the wall by machining or chemically milling a thicker wall.

Sample Calculation 8-4

(a )  Critical axial compressive load of the cylindrical section with no internal pressure.
(b)  Required internal tank pressure to offset an axial compressive load of 100,000 lb with no compressive stress on the cylindrical section.

8.4 STORABLE-LIQUID-PROPELLANT TANK DESIGN

The design of tanks for storable liquid propellants uses the same general design practices applied to other propellant tanks, except in the area of com patibility. Most storable propellants will remain stable for long periods if stored in tanks constructed of compatible materials. To minimize propellant decomposi t ion and tank-material corrosion, the surface of tank walls in contact with the propellants must be smooth and clean.

Tank-material Compatibil i ty

Final selection of tank material requires a study to determine compatibility of it and its fabrication processes with the propellants. Two major consid erations should be kept in mind: the required storage life and the applicability of available data. Several material/propellant compatibility test programs have been conducted; but some have reported results at variance, possibly as a consequence of the way ma terial coupons were processed before the test, the testing of material coupons vs. fabricated tanks, using techniques to achieve "long-term" results with short term tests, and differing environmental conditions.

The Air Force Astronautics Laboratory (formerly Air Force Rocket Propuls ion Laboratory) has conducted extensive long-term-compatibility tests of coupons and tanks using numerous combinations of alloys and propellants. A series of reports have documented the results, one of the latest being
"Metallurgical Analysis of Liquid Rocket Tankage," by E.J. King and H.G. Kammerer, AFRPL TR-84-054.

Tank Construction

Eliminating main tenance  dur ing storage and prelaunch activities represents one of the prime de sign objectives for storable-propellant tankage. All welded construction permits this. To achieve iso lation, leakproof burst diaphragms or pyrotechnic valves are installed at the inlets and outlets of the tanks. Propellant fill ports are capped and welded after tanking. Tandem tanks are favored over concen


PROPELLANT TANKS 2 9 7

tric tanks, since they separa te  propel lants  more positively during storage, transportation, and adverse condit ions.  Some applicat ions have the c o m m o n bulkhead between two propellant tanks designed to withstand a differential pressure in either direction that may result from nonsimultaneous pressurization. However,  the diaphragm at the pressurant inlet to the oxidizer tank of the A-4 Stage system, being designed to a lower burst pressure than the pressurant inlet diaphragm for the fuel tank, keeps  the oxidizer-tank pressure always higher.

Full-penetration welds should be used in the construction of all propellant  tanks, and especially tanks for storable propellants.  A full-penetration Weld shows complete fusion to the root of the joint. All such welds which cannot  be  dye-penetrant-in spected  at the root must be x-rayed to ensure full penetration. Figure 8-8 presents the design detail of a typical full-penetration, single-weld butt joint.

If possible, interpropellant welding (i.e., the fuel and oxidizer separated by only one welded joint)
should be avoided in tank designs. A double-weld design will prevent the mixing of propellants due to a single failure of welded joints. Figure 8-9 presents the design of a typical storable propellant  tank with a forged one-piece common bulkhead. A double-weld des ign is used on the center -hold  joint for the oxidizer duct.

Wall Surface Requirements

The tank must be cleaned with a solvent or, in some instances,  with an alkaline or acid solution to eliminate contamination that may cause corrosion or be  reactive with the p rope l l an t - - a  process called
"passivation." In extreme circumstances,  it can be achieved by application of a propellant rinse before loading the propellant.

8.5 CRYOGENIC-LIQUID-PROPELLANT TANK DESIGN

Design of cryogenic-propellant tanks presents several potent ia l  p rob lem areas that may  affect p roper functioning and reliability: propert ies  of  the tank construct ion materials at the cryogenic propellant service temperature  range, thermal stresses induced in the tank structure by temperature  gradients, the relief of  tank pressure caused  by boitoff of  the cryogenic propellants, and thermal insulation of the tank wails.

Knowledge of the precise strength characteristics, degree of brittleness, and notch sensitivity of the tank construction materials at cryogenic temperatures  (as low as -423F for l iqu id-hydrogen  service) is a prerequisite for their selection. In general, most  of the a l u m i n u m  al loys and  the austeni t ic  a n d semiaustenitic stainless steels possess good mechan ical propert ies  at cryogenic temperatures  (also see Chapter 2). The thermal stresses can be analyzed by de te rmin ing  the t e m p e r a t u r e  profi le  at va r ious regions of  the tank and may  be minimized by discrete design approaches.  The capacity of the tank relief valve should  be  ba sed  on the m a x i m u m anticipated propel lant  boi loff  rate during g round hold and actual operation of the vehicle systems.

Among the cryogenic  propellants ,  liquid hy drogen imposes the most  serious tank-design prob lems, mainly due to its very low service temperature and  its relatively large specific volume.  Des ign problems are especially acute with the hydrogen-tank insulation. It often becomes  one of the most critical design factors in a hydrogen-fueled vehicle system. The  difficulties arising in hydrogen  sys tems in connect ion with heat  transfer may be dramatically illustrated as follows.

Assume two tanks of  equal size, subject to the same heat influx per unit time, one filled with liquid oxygen and the other with liquid hydrogen. The ratio of  heat of  vaporization per  unit weight O/H = 0.48, but density ratio O/H = 14.3. Thus the volume rate of vaporization in the hydrogen tank will be 6.85 times faster than in the oxygen tank. In reality, the heat influxes would not be  equal for two uninsulated tanks, because of the higher temperature differential across the wall, and  especial ly  b e c a u s e  of the grea t ly increased heat-transfer rate from air liquefaction on the hydrogen-tank surface. This may further accel erate the hydrogen boiloff to approximately 70 times that of oxygen. In an actual oxygen/hydrogen system operat ing at a weight  mixture ratio O/H = 5, the tanked mixture ratio by  volume H/O = 3.23. De pending on the shape of the tanks (surface ratio), this may again double or triple the relative boiloff of  hy drogen. Insulation, it is clear, must drastically reduce heat influx into a hydrogen system.

DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Boiloff rate is not the only problem caused by the physical properties of hydrogen. Near the ambient boiling temperature, the gradient of vapor pressure is 2.4 psi/'R, as compared to 0.78 psi/'R for liquid oxygen. Moreover, this gradient increases rapidly with increasing temperature, which would be experienced following tank pressurization. Figures 8 10 and 8-11 show the trend for both liquid oxygen and hydrogen. The data have great significance to pump NPSH. As may be seen, just one degree of liquid-hydrogen temperature rise requires a 3-psi increase in tank pressure to maintain proper NPSH. In a large vehicle, the required increase in tank-wall thickness may affect payload noticeably. The sit uation is further aggravated by the high heat influx into hydrogen, for reasons mentioned in connection with boiloff. Even for relatively short boost periods, rapid warm-up may create a problem more severe than boiloff, and place further emphasis on adequate insulation. The following discussion of tank insula tions therefore emphasizes hydrogen service.

Insulat ion  Requirements  for Cryogenic-Propel lant  Tanks

Most vehicle missions include three distinct phases calling for effective insulation of cryogenic-propel lant tanks: ground hold, boost phase, and coast in space. The propellant-tank insulation design will primarily be based on flight-performance criteria. However, propellant evaporative losses during long hold periods on the ground requiring continuous topping may become a significant cost item. Then it may be economical to provide an insulating blanket on the tank, and remove it just before liftoff. The boost phase sees high temperatures from aerody namic heating and large aerodynamic forces. Although of short duration, this phase dictates the structural elements of the insulation. During coast in space, the principal source of thermal energy, ra diation from the sun and planets, can be blocked by radiation shields surrounding the basic tank in sulation, thereby effectively controlling the heat flux across the tank wall. Very important will be the properties of the materials used in a solar shield, such as the absorptivity and emissivity of the surface when subjected to various types of radiation and body temperatures. The amount of shielding re quired depends on the duration of the coast and on optimization of shield weight vs. propellant-boiloff weight.

Basic Insulat ion Types

Major desirable design features of an insulation include light weight, uniform and repeatable in sulation characteristics, ease of application, low cost, low hazard, reasonable ruggedness, ease of repair, good reliability, and, above all, low heat-conductivity.

Excellent results can be achieved with a lami nated-type insulat ion--an aluminum foil and a structural material, often in multiple layers. The aluminum foils act as reflectors, effectively rejecting radiative heat, while the evacuated space in between prevents conductive heat transfer. This insulation can be applied to single-curved and to large-diameter, double-curved surfaces. The laminar insulation can fairly easily be damaged, however, possibly resulting in loss of vacuum (cracks and infiltration of gas, for instance). Use of this type of insulation in atmo spheric applications has therefore been infrequent.

Honeycomb-suppor ted  structures are finding wide application. Figure 8-12 shows typical externally applied hydrogen-tank insulation. A 1/2- to 3/4-in. nominal-size plastic honeycomb goes between an inner and outer facing sheet. The cells may or may not be filled with an isocyanate-type foam, de pending on weight limitations. The foam bubbles or the properly sealed cells will form individual vacuum spaces when cold (cryopumping). However, because of the possibility of vacuum degradation by in filtration of air (outer insulation), or hydrogen
(inside insulation), it is often preferred to purge the cells with helium, for which lateral passage ways must be provided. The purge also serves as a leak-detec tion device, in conjunction with gas analyzers, to detect contamination of the helium from leaks. Figure

8-12 shows a separate gap purged with helium, rather than the honeycomb cells. Thermal conductivity of the insulation shown is about 3.8 x 10-7 Btu-in./in.2-s "F (0.2 Btu-in./ft2-h-'F).

Thermal conductivities of various types of in sulation vary from 0.05 x 10-7 to 6.0 x 10-7 Btu-in./in.2 s-'F. Densities range from 2.0 to 20 lb/ft3. Since the quality of an insulation will affect cost and weight, an optimization study will have to be made, based on mission characteristics.

(bs-55)

Many factors will influence the selection of a tank insulation design. The insulation may be located in ternal or external to the tank wall. It can be integral or disposable during boost; i.e., it can be bonded in place or mechanically retained. Basically, any insu lation applied to a tank must be justified with respect to advantages of performance and/or economy.

Locating the insulation inside the propellant tank has the obvious advantage of protecting the insu lation from handling damage. The tank structure is isolated from the severest low-temperature effects of the propellant and is thus subjected to only mod erate thermal cycling from its source. Internal insulation also minimizes propellant  loss w h e n chilling the tank during filling. However, if a crack or leak should occur in internal insulation of a hydro gen tank, gaseous hydrogen would enter the crack and gradually increase the heat transfer. Other undesir able features of internal insulation include difficulties in installation, in locating and repairing of leaks, and in cleaning the tank. Internal insulation is also subject to higher pressures and more severe temperature effects, which tend to impair the insulation sealing.

External insulation has the advantage of isolating the tank structure from the extreme temperature of aerodynamic  heat ing during boost. Installation, repair, and sealing of the external insulation can all be done without special consideration of access, ventilation, and curing techniques in closed areas. However, special consideration will be required for tank-leak detection, especially with integrally insu lated areas. A crack in the external insulation will allow liquefaction of air and cryopumping, resulting in a significant rise in heat transfer.

Insulation for C o m m o n  Bulkheads

When a common bulkhead is used between propel lant tanks and cryogenics are involved, insulation is required to prevent freezing of the propellant with the higher boiling point. Figure 8-13 shows the equatorial  area of a typical insulated c o m m o n bulkhead. A fiberglass honeycomb is located be tween a forward and an aft facing sheet. In the equatorial area, where the facing sheets have to be faired into the cylindrical tank portion, they are reinforced by waffle grid ribs. This design also re quires special insulation on the inside of the LOX

8.6 COMPOSITE LIQUID-PROPELIANT TANK DESIGN

Most tanks with surfaces of revolution can be fab ricated as a continuous filament wrapped in a spe cific pattern, impregnated with resin, and then cured. Compared to metals, such composite has relatively high s t rength- to-weight  ratio, owing to the intrinsically higher strength of uniform filiaments and the ability to vary directional properties in the wrapping process.

The progression of filament material technology has been from fiberglass (E-Glass and S-Glass) to aramid (Kevlar) to graphite. The strength-to-density ratio advantage for composites has increased from
2:1 for E-Glass to 10:1 for graphite, compared to metal tanks. An additional weight advantage can be achieved by design efficiency. For example, loads in the cylindrical section of a tank are twice as great in the circumferential direction as in the meridional direction. Fibers in a composite structure can be oriented to correspond to the directional variability, but metal tanks must be designed for the circum ferential loads, leaving a large excess in the merid ional direction. Uniform properties and good reliability require the use of numerically-controlled winding machines to orient the fibers precisely. Fig ure 8-14 shows a typical filament-wound tank.

Being relatively porous and incompatible with propellants, composites must be separated from the contained fluid by a liner, either elastomeric (for pressurant-gas storage) or metallic. Elastomeric liner materials, such as chlorobutyl or acrylonitrile rubber, are formed over a rigid, water-soluble mandrel, the composite overwrap applied and cured, and then the mandrel washed out. Such a liner, for tanks less than
4 ft. in diameter, will typically have a leakage rate of
10 -4 scc/s.

Metallic liners can either be thin and carry essentially no load or relatively thick and carry as much as 20% at operating pressure. The design and fabrication of metallic liners are similar to metallic tanks, but being relatively thin can cause design problems at thickness-transition regions, fabrication problems in meeting tolerances, and welding prob lems. Leakage rates, for tanks less than 4 ft. in diameter, are typically less than 10-7 scc/s.

Helical Windings Polar Fitting

Since the cyclic fatigue of the composite will far exceed that of a metallic liner, liner design becomes critically important. In a typical design, the liner plastically deforms during proof testing, while the composite does not exceed its elastic limit. Upon venting of the proof pressure, the composite returns to its original shape and causes the liner to be in compression. During subsequent operating pressure cycles, the liner is subjected to compressive and tensional stresses that are not always in the elastic range. Ductility and toughness are therefore impor tant parameters in the selection of a liner material. Alloys that have been used include 2219, 5086, 6061
and 6351 aluminum, 321 stainless steel, 6AI-4V and
15-3 titaniums, and Inco-718.

Another consideration in the design of com posite tanks will be useful life at pressurized condi tions, usually referred to as "static-fatigue life." This drops as the operational pressure conditions, ex pressed as a percentage of ultimate strength, increase. Because of scatter in experimental data, a reliability value is normally expressed along with the static fatigue-life requirement.

8.7 DESIGN OF PROPELLANT-TANK PRESSURANT DIFFUSERS

A pressurant diffuser introduces the pressurant gas evenly into the propellant tank at a desired direction and velocity. The gas is usually injected in a plane near the forward end, at a right angle to the tank and vehicle axes. This will minimize disturbances at the pressurant/propellant interface. Figure 8-15 presents some typical designs for a propellant-tank pressurant diffuser. A radial-type diffuser, located at the tank axis, serves the fuel tank. This arrangement permits a simple, lightweight diffuser design. However, the reversed ellipsoidal common bulkhead at the forward end of the oxidizer tank requires a ring-type diffuser, consisting of many individual diffusing nozzles at the circumference of the tank.

The pressurant enters the tank at a temperature depending on the source, such as a LOX heat ex changer. In some cases, because this may not be the optimum temperature for critical structural members, a separation tube (Hilsch tube) may be combined with the diffuser. Without moving parts, it operates on the principle of separating the higher-energy from lower-energy molecules. Temperature spreads of
100"F or more can be obtained, depending on con struction and available pressure-drop. In a LOX/
hydrogen system with common bulkhead, the device may be used to direct the cold stream toward the bulkhead, thus lowering the temperature differential and heat transfer across it.

8.8 PROPELLANT EXPULSION UNDER ZERO-GRAVITY OR OSCIIZATORY g-LOADING CONDITIONS

Under zero or oscillatory g-loading conditions typ ical of many vehicle trajectories, the propellant's location in a tank becomes uncertain and thus requires a means to prevent gas from being expelled with the propellant. The propellant must be sub

"impulse settling" and "propellant management."

Settling

This method employs a small propulsive force di rected axially, parallel to the vehicle center line of thrust. This acceleration forces the propellant to the tank outlet before initiation of main-engine oper ation. This approach especially suits most space ve hicles, because their low-thrust reaction control units can also provide the thrust for propellant settling.

Although this method would eliminate the need for propellant-management devices for the main propellant tanks, it would necessitate them in sep arate tanks for the sole use of the reaction-control system. This settling method has the possible dis advantages of no control of vehicle center-of-gravity shifts and low thrust-to-weight ratio under these conditions, which may increase response time beyond tolerable limits.

For single-start upper stages, jettisonable short duration solid-propellant settling rockets may also be applied to advantage.

Propellant Management

The other method of achieving proper propellant orientation within the tanks is by continuously confining the propellant to the vicinity of the tank outlet. This may be accomplished by positive dis placement of the propellant with a moving surface or by using the surface tension properties of the propellant with a porous plate or screen.

A positive-expulsion propellant tank consists of an outer structural shell and an inner movable expulsion device, such as metallic diaphragm or bladder, elastomeric diaphragm or bladder, bellows, and pistons. A surface-tension propellant tank con sists of an outer structural shell and an inner compartment that confines a small portion of the propellant at the outlet at all times. The inner compartment  may be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the possible orientations of propellant within the tank when flow to the engine is required.

There are three important factors in the selection of a method of propellant management: the impulse on the vehicle generated by propellant movement, variation in the propellant center of gravity, and available tank envelope. Positive expulsion may be the only alternative if the impulse generated by propellant sloshing inside a tank with a surface tension device cannot be controlled adequately with reasonably sized baffles. Positive expulsion may also be required if the center-of-gravity shift caused by propellant movement during vehicle maneuvers with a surface tension device causes excessive attitude control-system requirements. Finally, bellows and pistons are not applicable if propellant volume requirements cannot be packaged into cylindrical tanks in the available envelopes.

Metallic Diaphragms

Metallic diaphragms (half shells) or bladders (full shells) can be used with spheroidal, cylindrical or conospheroidal tank shapes. Dual-wall containment of propellant uses a bladder, half of it normally thick
(stiff) enough to keep it from deflecting. As its

Bellows

Another metallic device for positive expulsion of propellant, bellows can be used in cylindrical tanks and may be either of the expanding or contracting type. In the expanding type, the propellant resides in the tank, ahead of the compressed bellows, which on



PROPELLANT TANKS 303

expansion ejects it. In the contracting type, the bellows contains propellant and when  compressed expels it.

Pistons

An al ternat ive  me thod  of ob ta in ing  posi t ive expulsion in cylindrical tanks, a piston actuated by pressurant  gas requires seals to prevent  leakage during operation. The seals may be piston-type rings or some type of wiper. In either case, the dimension and surface finish of the tank inside diameter should be maintained relatively accurate and smooth. In some designs a concentric center post guides the piston, requiring an additional seal. In other designs the surface in contact with the tank wall will be made long enough to prevent cocking of the piston. Figure
8-17 presents the design of a piston guided by a center post.

The pressure differential across the piston re quired to overcome friction during operation in creases the required pressurant pressure and the tank structural loads for a given propellant pressure at the tank outlet. The pressure differential may be estimated as follows:

Surface-tension Devices

Unlike a positive-expulsion device, a surface-tension device maintains propellant at the tank outlet without any moving parts by relying on the surface tension of the propellant. The principle may be quite simple, but the mechanical design can be complicated. The objective is to keep the surface-tension "compart ment" at the tank outlet filled with propellant while the rest of the tank is emptied. It is necessary to know where the propellant will be located during each type of maneuver, and that depends on the acceleration vector. Means of f lowing propel lant  from its locations into the compartment,  i.e., porous plates or wire screens, must then be positioned where the propellant is.

During a lateral maneuver, propellant is con tained within the PAD and along-the wall on one side of the tank in its forward section. Propellant in the forward section and aft compartment is separated by a bulkhead and a circumferential "communication"
wire-mesh screen (Fig. 8-19). As propellant flows out of the tank (and PAD), it is preferable to flow propellant rather than pressurant gas through the communication screen into the PAD.

As long as propellant wets a portion of the screen, the propellant will wick and wet the entire screen. When wetted, the screen will preclude the flow of gas up to a certain differential pressure, called the "bubble point." The "breakdown" differential pressure can be increased by reducing the pore size of the screen (increasing the mesh wires per inch). The differential pressure is created by height (Fig. 8 19), the vehicle acceleration, and the propellant velocity through the screen. The screen must be designed so that the bubble point exceeds the pressure differential.

Design of Interconnecting Components and Mounts

9.1 INTERCONNECT COMPONENTS

Interconnect components are defined here as fluid carrying conduits--lines or ducts along with integral elements such as bellows, flexible joints, flexible hoses, flanges and seals, tube fittings, and engine gimbal mounts. Except for the gimbal mounts, all of the above components also connect other rocket-en gine system components together.

Line Assemblies

As the first requirement, interconnect components and lines must remain leak-tight under the extreme conditions found within an engine system during rocket operation. Second, under all expected condi tions, movement in one end of a line (or duct) must not unduly stress either components fastened to the other end or line components. Once a design meets these two requirements, then reliability enhancement, weight/cost reduction, and other features can be op timized. This methodology was followed in designing the LH2/LO2 turbopump-fed engine system shown in Fig. 9-1.

Over the years, requirements keep increasing. The engines used on the Saturn vehicle and the asso ciated propellant-feed systems had severe design re quirements. Line sizes, operating pressures, flow ve locities, and gimballing life all exceeded previous engine requirements. More recently, the Space Shuttle Program specification for hardware design included the new requirement of reusability. That in troduced the need for longer low- and high-cycle fa tigue life, improved long-term corrosion resistance, a greater number of gimballing cycles for articulating ducts, and ease of maintenance and refurbishment. Another new requirement was the high chamber pressure of the engine (3000 psi, three times greater than previous operational man-rated rocket engines)
and very high pump-discharge pressures (as high as
8500 psi), forcing the use of stronger materials.

Propellant-supply Ducts

Principal interconnections between engine and vehi cle include the propellant-supply ducts that operate at relatively low pressure. Since every psi of propel lant-tank pressure above the minimum required for proper engine performance adds weight to the tank walls and gas pressurants, it is desirable to keep the pressure losses between tank outlets and engine inlets to a minimum.

The task of designing these ducts, or at least the flexible portion of them immediately upstream of the engine, frequently falls to the engine designer. The designer must find an optimum balance between low pressure-drop (by making the duct diameter as large as possible) and flexibility and structural integrity, which in general becomes more difficult with increas ing duct diameter. The designer must further con sider the fact that the ducts, because of their location off the engine gimbal center, experience torsional loads in addition to bending. Furthermore, the ducts are subjected to internal pressure, frequently in a stringent cryogenic and vibration environment. The many forces acting upon the ducts call for restrainers

These may be located inside the ducts, thus adding to undesired pressure drop; or they may be applied externally, which increases the duct envelope and may cause interference with other vehicle systems.

Figure 9-2 shows a typical flexible propellant supply duct that has outer restraining linkages for stabilizing the bellows. At the vehicle end, these ducts will connect to longer or shorter ducts, the length of which depends on the tank being con nected, fore or rear. It is important that the engine designer inform the vehicle builder not only of con necting-flange dimensions and types of gasket being used, but also of the forces transmitted by the engine duct to the vehicle during gimballing. In most pump fed systems, the working pressure of propellant-sup ply ducts usually does not exceed 50 psig. In upper stages, during lower-stage boost, however, pressures may temporarily be substantially higher as a result of combination of high accelerations and full tanks (100
psig and over).

The compression-type duct system (Fig. 9-3) uses free bellows (i.e., no tension-tie linkage across the bellows) to absorb the deflections imposed on the duct during operation. The pressure-separating loads on the bellows react to the supporting engine or ve hicle structure. Brackets may be required to offset column buckling if the ducting has a large length-to diameter ratio; i.e., > 1 (Fig. 9-3a). The compression type system, although widely applied, will usually be limited to low-pressure applications such as the inlet ducts of the engine propellant pumps to avoid un necessarily heavy restraining structures.

A line containing flexible joints will be given a centerline geometry that will minimize the number of flexible joints. Since a flexible joint (bellows) is complex, costly, and not as reliable as a hard line, the necessity for each flexible joint receives careful scrutiny in the design phase. System considerations that must be kept in mind during the centerline rout ing and locating of flexible joints include provisions for line deflection and clearance under vibration, thermal contraction and expansion, and engine gim bailing; accessibility for installation inspection and removal; wrench clearance around bosses and fit tings; accessibility for in-place welding or repair;
consideration for clearance if the line needs insula tion; and accessibility to other major components. Whenever critical components become integral parts of a line, such as a flowmeter, reliability must be weighed against the replaceability of the component.

A classic configuration adhering to the mini mum-number-of-flex-joints principle (believed to have originated with, pump-discharge ducts for the Atlas-booster engines)rathe wraparound duct ar rangement for gimballing engines shown in Fig. 9-4
places a flex joint centered on each of the two gim bal axes. This geometry has been used for the Atlas, Thor, and Jupiter engine pump-discharge ducts, the pump-inlet ducts of the H-1 engine, the gimballing feedlines of the Apollo Service Module engine, and the descent engine for the Lunar Excursion Module
(LEM). It was used for all of the vehicle-to-engine in terface lines of the F-1 engine except the main pro pellant lines.

The SSME uses the wraparound concept exten sively~seven articulating ducts and six braided-metal hose assemblies crossing the engine-gimbal plane. Each of the ducts has three tension-type bellows joints with one of the joints centered as closely as m

possible on each of the gimbal axes. The ducts are arranged in parallel routing around the gimbal in a plane perpendicular to engine thrust line (Fig. 9-5).

The second important consideration in duct routing, the location of flexible joints, calls for a kinematic analysis to determine the optimum loca tion for flexible joints in the system. Each will be positioned in the duct assembly to maximize the de flection capability of the assembly. Further, each joint will be placed and designed to accommodate as few modes of deflection as possible and to minimize any deflection of the joint, thus imposing minimum strain. Torsional deflections and "Hooke's Joint" ef fect may also impose significant restrictions.

The ducts contain bellows sections that permit the degree of movement required between thrust chamber and turbopump to accommodate tol erance buildups, misalignments, and motion due to temperature change and acceleration loads. In some engine designs, however, rigid, in-place welded ducts have been successfully applied. Therefore, the sepa rating pressure loads acting on the two components connected by a flexible member must be absorbed by restraining links attached tO the bellows or by other compensating means.

308 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES wire-braided flexible hoses or tubing, because of their relatively small size (often less than 1 inch).

Propellant-tank-pressurization l ines. These lines connect the main propellant tanks to the pres surant sources such as stored-pressurant-gas s y s t e m s
(including storage bottles, heat exchangers, pressure regulators), gas generators, cryogenic-propellant heat exchangers, etc. High-pressure hoses and tubings are used.

Seal  d r a i n  lines. It is difficult to achieve per fect dynamic sealing at the shafts of turbopumps and other components.  Seal drains are therefore often provided between two dynamic seals placed in series. The required seal drain-lines, including flexible hoses and tubings, are routed away and overboard. For LO2/RP-1 systems, this can be done by routing the drain lines along the thrust chamber wall to the chamber  exit. Propellant combinations that can form highly explosive mixtures require routing to suf ficiently spaced vent ports at the vehicles periphery. Figure 9-7 shows a schematic of a typical pump-seal drain line for an .upper-stage system. The seal drain lines are routed to the vehicle periphery during boost flight and to chamber exits in stage operation.

Pneumatic supply lines. Liquid-propellant rocket engines usually have one or more pressure vessels to supply pneumatic pressure for valve actua tion, turbine start, sequenced purges, and other pur poses. The vessels must be charged before a test run or flight, requiring high-pressure flexible line connec tions to the vehicle and disconnects at the vehicle periphery. The design of these not only must consid er the mating counterpart on the vehicle side but also the type of fluid and its temperature and pres sure.

Cryogenic-propellant bleed lines. Cryogenic propellant engine systems with turbopump feed may experience difficulties during start if the metal parts containing cryogenic fluid are at ambient or insuffi ciently low temperatures, and if the fluids in the vol umes below the tank outlet are superheated and form gas pockets. Since the pressure upon opening of the main valves and start of the turbopumps will further reduce the static pressure at the pump inlet, gas pro duction will accelerate and, in turn, may cause pump cavitation and starving of the gas generator. To pre vent this, a continuous bleed from a point farthest downstream from the pump inlet is applied until shortly before engine start. In this manner, fresh liq Gimbal Center (Typ)

To avoid hazardous conditions at the launch site, the bleeds, particularly if they can form com bustible or explosive mixtures, .are ducted away, through a line connection from the engine to the ve hicle and beyond. Such lines are usually made of wire-braided flexible hose and tubings.

A special case is presented by cryogenic engines in upper stages that will not start until some time af ter the bleeds have been closed at liftoff or that have to start after prolonged cruising periods. For them will be preferred a recirculation system that returns the fluids to the tanks rather than dumping them overboard. Lines across the interface between engine and vehicle are required.

Bleed and recirculation flows can be minimized if the vehicle builder will provide the means, such as subcooling, insulation, avoidance of temperature stratification, maximum economic tank pressure to keep the temperature of the bulk sufficiently below the boiling temperature at operating tank pressures. In some cases, prechilling of metal parts exposed to cryogenic fluids may be advantageously done by cooling media supplied from ground through a vehi cle disconnect to the engine. Routing of all lines mentioned will be similar to drain lines (Fig. 9-7).

P u r g e  lines. During the start and shutdown se quences, and for prerun and postrun servicing, inert gas purges are frequently required to keep a system dry, to prevent combustible mixtures from forming, or to expel residual propellants. If they are continu ous during ground hold, it is advantageous to feed them from ground to avoid increased flight weight. This requires connecting lines from the engine to the vehicle. It is strongly recommended that entirely separate purge systems for each propellant be em ployed to avoid backup of one fluid into the system of the other. Check valves are not considered as re liable as strict separation. For engine design, we are concerned here only with purges that connect di rectly to an inlet port of an engine part, such as the thrust-chamber cooling jacket or injector manifold. From the viewpoint of the environment in which the engine must operate, the engine designer should ad ditionally specify the purges to be provided by the vehicle building to condition the engine compart ment as needed. All purge lines can be made of wire-braided flexible hoses and tubings and may be routed as are the drain lines.

Hydraulic l ines.  Various high-pressure hy draulic lines are used in a liquid-propellant rocket engine for hydraulic actuating, lubrication, etc. All lines must permit flexure and must be of the proper size and pressure rating. Most of the hydraulic lines are made of wire-braided flexible hoses and tubings.

Turbine-drive, high-pressure, hot-gas ducts. In most turbopump-feed engines, the gas generator connects directly to the turbine inlet; thus, there is no need for ducting. In some designs, however, high pressure hot-gas ducts must make the connection be tween gas generator and turbines (in systems with two individual tu rbopumps)  or be tween  main-thrust chamber bleedoff ports and turbines (tapoff gas-tur bine-drive systems). These ducts usually consist of



INTERCONNECTING COMPONENTS AND MOUNTS 309

rigid and flexible sections made of stainless steels and nickel-based alloys, for service temperatures up to approximately 1700"F. The ducts must be capable of absorbing considerable deflections from thermal expansion, in addition to deflections due to mis alignments and dynamic loads.

Turbine-exhaust,  hot-gas ducts. The hot gases from the turbine exhaust may be ducted to near the main-chamber nozzle exit or into a thrust-cham ber exhaust manifold. Most turbine-exhaust ducts are of welded-stainless-steel or nickel-alloy sheet-metal construction. Bellows sections permit the degree of movement  required by the system for thermal ex pansion, misalignments, and tolerances. In most cryogenic propellant systems, a heat exhanger in the exhaust-duct assembly vaporizes one of the propel lants, usually LOX, for tank pressurization.

Sizing

Flow area.  After the centerline routing of the duct has been established, the inside diameter (ID)
must be determined. The ID will represent a com promise among tolerable system pressure-drop, available space, weight, spring rate and pressure thrust reaction of bellows, system dynamic considera tions, and cost.

Any prediction of system energy loss based on the test data for individual elements will likely be very conservative. Flow tests on pressure loss of a particular component usually are run to evaluate the maximum component loss. The maximum loss is re alized when the installation incorporates a long straight run downstream of the test component; only part of the loss chargeable to the component actually occurs within its confines, the remainder arising from flow disturbances downstream of it. Obviously, if an other component closely follows the first, part of the effect of the first will cancelled. Thus, a 180-deg re turn bend causes no more than four-thirds the loss of a 90-deg elbow, or slightly over twice the loss of a 45 deg elbow. Calibration of a particular component, will subtract test-setup tare (i.e., basic pressure drop of the test setup only, with the component under test removed) from total differential pressure. References
9-1 through 9-2 provide detailed procedures. Ref erences 9-3 through 9-7 treat pressure losses in duct components.

Wall t h i c k n e s s .  After the duct flow area has been sized, the duct wall thicknesses can be estab lished through a stress analysis, in which the magni tudes of the stresses produced by fluid pressure, fluid flow, thermal gradients, external forces, and accelera tion forces are evaluated so that the optimum thick ness for reliability, fabricability, and weight mini mization can be selected.

Determination of hard-line wall thickness must be carefully assessed because the lack of flexible sec tions requires that the line itself and its attachment points be capable of handling any applied load. The structural analysis of hard lines is based on the max imum envelope resulting from tolerance stackups. The minimum wall thickness, developed from basic thin-shell theory, is based on maximum operating pressure at the critical operating temperature and in cludes the effect of thinning in the bends. The flanges are designed to develop the axial yield strength of the line at operating temperature. Max imum misalignment, thermal, and discontinuity loads must be determined.

Life considerations for hard lines include both high- and low-cycle fatigue. High-cycle fatigue will limit the effective alternating stress due to pressure and vibration enough to provide a given minimum safety factor on the material-endurance limit. For low-cycle fatigue, the effective peak strain resulting from both primary stresses (pressure and vibration)
and secondary stresses (misalignment,.thermal, and discontinuity) typically will be limited to provide a minimum given factor on cycles. The strain levels of hard lines can be up to twice the yield strain. Yielding during the initial installation will permit op eration in the elastic region for subsequent loadings.

Control o f  Pressure Drop

Elbow f l o w  losses. When engine vehicle inter faces do not permit a straight approach, flow must be directed into the engine (or pump) through elbows. For flow in a given Reynolds number regime, the loss coefficient for an elbow attains a minimum value and then increases as the ratio of bend radius to inside diameter (R/D) decreases. Pressure drop can be minimized by selecting an optimum R/D value for the elbow; otherwise, pressure drop can be mini mized by addition of flow guide vanes. (See Ref. 9-8.)

In an elbow having a small R/D value, guide vanes provide parallel-flowing elbows of more nearly optimum R/D. Flow guide vanes as shown in Fig. 9-8, are utilized in sharp elbows at the pump inlets for the Centaur (RL10), Thor, Atlas, and Saturn S-IC (F-l) en gines, and have also been used in the pump dis charge ducts of the Thor and Jupiter engines. Min imization of pressure drop in all these applications directly enhances engine performance. (References
9-9 and %10 provide design data on pressure loss for flow guide vanes). Because vanes can be excited by fluid oscillations in the system, vane frequencies must be calculated to avoid potential vibration.

Branch or takeoff duct centerlines are aligned with mainline flow directions to capture mainline ve locity pressure. This alignment yields higher avail able pressure at the branch inlet than would be avail

Minimum tapoff-pressure drop figures im portantly in applications such as tapoffs from main propellant ducts to gas-generator bootstrap lines. Reference 9-11 provides information on optimum takeoff angle.

Bellows f l o w  loss. The flow loss in a bellows exceeds cons iderablyml0 to 15 t imes-- that  of a smooth pipe of the same diameter. Pressure loss in straight lengths of unsleeved bellows can be calcu lated using the following expressions from Ref. 9-8:

/ 1.6
f - 0 . 4  hDi (9-1)

NDi where N = number of convolutions per in., f --- Darcy Weisbach friction factor, h - height of convolution, and Di = inner diameter of bellows. After determin ing f, the following formula can be used to determine the total pressure loss:

LoV 2
Ap _ DiZg (9-2)

where Ap = total pressure loss, p = fluid density, V =
average fluid velocity through bellows, g - gravitation constant, and L = line length.

Figure 9-9 may be used to determine the pres sure-loss factor for 90-deg bends in convoluted metal hoses, using K in place of f in the above formula for the total pressure loss in the elbow. Bellows flow lin ers frequently can minimize the high friction losses in the convolutions.

Flow-area change. Almost every interface where a line begins or terminates involves an area change to or from the line. The shape of these tran sitions requires consideration to avoid excessive pressure loss from abrupt flow-area changes. Flow

90% if the edges of the contraction are radiused rather than sharp. Radii larger than 0.15 times the contracted diameter add little improvement. For ex panding sections, little reduction in pressure loss for a given area ratio can be expected unless the diver gence cone angle is kept small (total included angle near 10 deg).

In small-diameter lines with threaded fittings, care must be exercised in calculating the line losses, because standard fittings (unions, tees, elbows, and crosses) usually have a smaller ID than the tubing it self. Reference 9-12 presents data on loss factors for fittings.

F l o w  d i s t r i b u t i o n .  The flow distribution (to maintain equal pressure drop) at the exit of engine feed ducting importantly affects duct design. For ex ample, the flow profile at pump, valve, and injector entrances can have a great effect on the performance of these components. In pumps having dual op posed discharge-ports, the attached ducts must have equal pressure loss to ensure equal flow out of each port. Flow distribution has been improved with vaned elbows (Fig. 9-8) and with "egg crate" straight eners (Fig. 9-10) downstream of elbows. This latter design evolved as a solution to the uneven flow dis tribution of LOX from the inlet elbow to the injector on the Atlas and Thor engines.

The splitter in the propellant feedlines of the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) descent engine (Fig.
9-11) represents another flow-directing device for achieving even distribution. The engine utilizes re dundant shutoff valves; in normal operation, both valves open and close simultaneously. In a partial failure, however, either of the valves can be closed. Flow into the valves therefore must be evenly dis tributed for minimum effect on engine performance. That can be done with the flow splitter in the duct el bow immediately upstream of the valves.

Flow straighteners or splitters, or any other struc tures that rigidly span the diameter of a duct, cause

structural loading by differential thermal expansion or contraction. In a duct, the vane usually heats or cools during thermal transients at a faster rate than the restraining duct wall. When this happens,  the vanes try to move farther than the duct will allow. Differentials large enough can distort or destroy the vanes or duct. This can be prevented by an expan sion element in the duct-to-vane connection that will slide or flex, absorbing thermally-induced motion while transmitting minimum loads to the wall. One effective solution has been a sliding clevis joint, which allows sliding normal to the wall but ade quately carries the flow loads on the vane to the wall. A different approach was used on the SSME low-pres sure fuel duct to avoid the thermal expansion and contraction problem. This duct had the egg crate machined into a tube section that was then welded into the duct.

F l o w  r e s i s t a n c e .  Surface friction between rough duct walls and the flowing fluid can produce large pressure losses. As the ratio of roughness-height to duct diameter increases, so does the pressure loss. Castings generally have undesirably rough walls and are smoothed to improve flow efficiency. Drawn-tub ing and sheet-metal  ducts have been adequately smooth for all applications, but weld protrusions into the flow stream have to be controlled when they con tribute sufficient disturbance to the flow stream. Weld protrusions contribute much more to large contraction ratio in small lines than they do in large.

In flexible-joint assemblies with internal ties (e.g., chain link, tripod with ball-and-socket bearing, inter nal gimbal ring), the linkages protrude into the flow stream and cause head losses. Reference 9-13 pre sents data on pressure-loss factors for some of these bellows restraints.

1962. A significant longitudinal instability occurred late in first-stage flight. Analysis showed that the vi bration was caused by a regenerative-feedback inter action be tween the vehicle's propulsion and struc tural systems. This lengthwise oscillation was named
"Pogo," after the motion of a pogo stick (Ref. 9-14). The incorporation of a simple hydraulic suppression device into the first-stage propellant feedlines solved Titan's Pogo problem; the oscillation amplitude at the payload was maintained within L0.25 g, a level tolerable to the astronauts in the Gemini spacecraft. Although Pogo is a system-design problem, duct de signers need to be aware of the phenomenon be cause it can influence their designs, particularly for pump-inlet ducts of a pump-fed system. (For a more complete discussion of Pogo, see section 10.7.)

Insulat ion

Insulation of propellant lines may be required on cryogenic lines to prevent condensation of liquid air or nitrogen on l iquid-hydrogen lines, to reduce chill-down recirculation flow rates, and to minimize propellant-subcooling requirements.  Nitrogen or liquid air should be kept from dripping because the liquid falling on critical components can easily make them inoperative. On the SSME, the fuel lines have been insulated using two different methods: vacuum jackets and polyurethane-foam insulation. A combi nation of the two was used on the low-pressure fuel duct and a fuel-bleed duct. The bellows flex joints have an outer bellows and air-tight supporting struc ture that provide a vacuum around the flex joints, and the rigid duct sect ion has a 1/2-in.-thick polyurethane molded-foam case with an outer cover of nickel to protect it. Damage has been known to occur on the nickel-plated cover due to handling and by abuse from ground-support personnel working in the area. A vacuum cover with a stronger outer tube could prevent some of this type of damage. The liq uid-oxygen lines were not insulated since the chill down recirculation flow rates and sub-cooling re quirements were acceptable without insulation.

9.2 DESIGN OF TUBING ASSEMBLIES

Interconnect tubing assemblies are made up of tub ing, in-line fittings, and threaded fittings or flanges on the tube ends for installation purposes. Tubing ordinarily will be made of corrosion-resistant steel or aluminum; but nickel-base alloys or titanium may be used for special applications. Design considerations include material, tube size, separable tube fitting or flange, and the engine-installation requirements.

Design Working Pressures for Tubing

Tubing normally used on rocket engines is corrosion resistant steel (18-8), annealed and pressure tested. Where weight is critical, aluminum may be used. The term "tube" refers to lines up to 2 in. in outside diam eter (OD). Flanged joints are the preferred method of attachment for tubing, although threaded coup

Tables 9-1 and 9-2 present pressure ratings for various tube sizes for corrosion-resistant and alu minum-alloy tubing. A factor of safety (i.e., the ratio of the ultimate strength of the tubing material to the maximum allowable working stress) of 4 may be used for most rocket-engine applications. Higher values (6
to 7) should be used in applications involving hazard and excessive vibration. For high-pressure applica tions, aluminum tubing should be avoided. Other al loys are available for high-pressure use, such as Inconel 625 with ultimate strength of 120,000 psi and yield strength of 60,000 psi and Inconel 718 with ul timate strength of 180,000 psi and yield strength of
150,000 psi.

Tubing Installations in Engine Systems

Installations requiring bends must be made with min imum distortion and constriction of the tubing. A satisfactory bend decreases tubing OD less than 6%. Table 9-3 lists recommended minimum bend radii for stainless-steel and aluminum-alloy tubing. The stainless-steel radii can also be used for Inconel ma terials. More severe forming is feasible but incurs in creased cost owing to special tooling requirements.

Tubing assemblies must be properly supported to prevent stresses and consequent weakening of the sys tem under vibration. In addition, proper support minimizes the danger of recoil and live whip in event of tube failure. Where tube fittings are employed, support  spacing should be reduced by 20% to account for the added weight. Supports should be placed as close as practical to each side of fittings, valves, and other components. Overhang should be minimized by placing supports as close to bends as conditions allow. Table 9-4 presents the recom mended maximum bracket spacing for common-size tubing assemblies in engine systems. Where tubes of different diameters are connected, average spacing may be used.

General design practice requires no detail draw ings for tubing assemblies less than the 3/8-in. size. They are shop-fitted according to an engine mockup during the assembly of the engine system.

War II and was carried over on the early rockets. These fittings have several disadvantages, which in most cases result in system leakages. Aluminum con nectors have limited strength to contain the system fluid in high-temperature or high-vibration environ ments and are subject to seizing under high torque. Stainless-steel connectors proved difficult to seal be cause of poor yield characteristics at the seal surface, difficulty in controlling the tube flare, tube cracking during flaring operation, and torque relaxation of the coupling due to temperature changes and vibration environment.

A machined flare sleeve (Fig. 9-12b) was devel oped to overcome some of the tube-flare problems. Put into service on the Saturn program, the flare sleeve provided the following advantages over the flared tube:

1) Tolerances in the conical-tube sealing surface can be closely controlled.

2) Increased rigidity of the machine flare resists distortion at the sealing surface.

3) The weak point of the tubing at the base of the flare is eliminated.

4) Seizing eliminated between tube and sleeve.
5) Greater hoop strength helps prevent seizing between sleeve (now the tube end) and coupling nut.
6) Stronger couplings permit higher torque, which improves sealing and resists nut relaxation. Another approach for achieving a seal on the flared connector, use of a soft material, generally copper or aluminum, between the steel interfaces
(Fig. 9-12c), raised the likelihood of making a leak free-coupling; but some of the above problems still exist (e.g., torque relaxation due to vibration, tube cracking during flaring operation). This seal created new problems, including improper seal installation
(which orificed the flow) and galling of the seal, which introduced metal particles into the fluid sys tem.

Due to the leakage problems with the flared-tube coupling, the Air Force issued a directive that re quires separable tube connectors to have redundant seals for new designs in space and launch vehicles. This requirement has been met by a dynamic beam connector per MIL-F-85421 (Fig. 9-13). Tests by users and manufacturers have demonstrated that the con nector has redundant seals in series and good sealing characteristics.

The dynamic beam connectors contain the fol lowing desirable features: all-metal construction, inte gral redundant seals in series, seals in most fluid sys tems, seals in cryogenic and elevated temperature units, seals in vacuum, low-pressure helium and fluids to 8000 psi, small envelope, light weight, high strength, low torque values, numerous attaching methods, availability in various materials, and less protrusion for easier component removal.

Small lines may be required to connect to com ponents or larger lines. For this purpose a threaded fitting and boss connection offers an alternative to a bolted flange. Figure 9-14a shows a line with a B-nut, union, and elastomer O-ring installed in a MS33649
boss and figure 9-14b shows a plug with a metallic seal (K-seal) installed. Section 9.3 describes seal se lection. It must be based on the service conditions. A special fitting available has a dynamic-beam-cou pling interface on one end and a straight thread on the other (Fig. 9-14c) that can be installed in the MS33649 boss. The tube fittings should be made of the same material type as the tube when possible to avoid coefficient-of-expansion~contraction problems and to prevent metal distortion during the torque operation. A fitting will be designed to be as strong as the strongest tubing of like material that would be used with it. Design details and dimensions of tube fittings can be found in AF, AS, and MS specs.

9.3 DESIGN OF FIANGED JOINTS

The interconnecting lines of a rocket-engine system must retain various fluids at a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Each of these lines may have one or more mechanical flanged joints requiring a static seal to prevent leakage. These flanged joints must satisfy the following requirements: "zero leakage" for man-rated systems (a phi losophy that developed through the Saturn vehicle development and flights and continued during the Shuttle Program), high re liability and low weight (a consideration often in conflict with high reliability), and low cost. The joint as an assembly must be capable of maintaining inti mate conformance of seal and sealing surfaces throughout the joint's life, regardless of all strains, loads, and thermal gradients. Such design can also be applied to other components,  such as thrust chamber, injector, dome, turbopump, and valve housing flanges.

Typical flanged-joint configurations, shown in Fig. 9-15, can be modified as required to mate with the various types of seal. Flanged joints are used where loads require the type of restraining force pro vided by bolts or vee clamps or where joint reliabil ity dictates the use of more than one threaded clamping fastener. Failure of a threaded coupling by thread disengagement can be catastrophic, whereas failure of one of a number of bolts on a flanged joint may have less impact. This factor was one of the rea sons that threaded couplings on the F-1 engine were limited to zero-pressure drain systems. The joint configurations used on this engine consisted primar ily of fiat-face flanges, flat face with seal cavity, and fiat-face flanges with swivel ring. The swivel-ring de sign was used where alignment of bolt patterns pre sented a problem. Leakage monitoring was provided on joints that were considered critical or were repre sentative of a family of joints of similar design and operational environment. On the J-2 engine, fiat-face flanges, fiat face with swivel ring, and threaded-boss couplings were used, with leakage monitoring at each joint. On the SSME, the high-pressure flanged joints used a raised flange with a seal cavity (Fig. 9-15h). A

Fig. 9-16 Comparison of flanged-coupling designs used on SSME and Saturn engines. design study showed this design to have a signifi cantly smaller envelope and to be lighter in weight than the flat-face flange. In addition to the raised face flange, bolt sizes on the SSME joints were kept small by using a larger number of bolts, and the bolt load per bolt was increased by using bolt elongation rather than a torque measurement. Figure 9-16 com pares typical SSME and Saturn joints. The SSME flange concept saved some 500 lb on the engine as compared to flat-face flanges.

Flange-Joint Design Integration

The flange joints normally consist of three ele m e n t s - t h e  flanges, the fasteners (bolts and nuts), and the seal. Proper integration of these elements must provide a leak-tight joint. In addition to the structural needs, other  considerations for flange joints include seal contact surfaces, rigidity, restrain ing mechanism, temperature, degree of sealing, leak age monitoring, and seal drainage.

Seal -contac t  s u r f a c e  on flanges. The success of the flanged joint in limiting leakage depends on its ability to make the necessary seal contact. The inter face requirements involve the seal housing on the flanges, surface fin!sh, machine lay, and surface flat ness and waviness. The sealing surface for aerospace type seals, including elastomeric O-rings, requires a a) Flange Bowing

Rigidity. Flange rigidity enables the coupling to resist deflections and distortions due to mechanical or thermal loading. The degree of rigidity required for a flange relates directly to the seal element that must compensate  for deflections and distortions. Figure 9-17 shows typical deflections and distortions that can cause leakage problems with flanged joints.

Flange bowing, the tendency for flanges to sepa rate between bolts as a consequence of thinness or an inadequate number of bolts, can be prevented by increasing the flange thickness or the number  of



316 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES bolts or both. Flange rotation denotes the tendency of the joint to separate at the seal surface as a conse quence of thin duct walls that have too little resis tance to the rotating moment, flanges that lack suffi cient rigidity and consequently deflect under high separating loads, insufficient flange contact outside the bolt circle, insufficient flange thickness, and an adverse thermal gradient that prevents the flange from expanding without constraint. The flange-rota tion problem normally will be resolved either by in creasing the flange rigidity or by increasing the abil ity of the seal to follow the flange separation. The current flange design practice permits deflections within the capability of one of the high-resilience type of seals (metal or elastomer), so that flange size and weight are kept to a minimum.

In the flange-joint design concept used on the SSME, the point of rotation is placed just on the pressure side of the seal and as near to it as possible, with a gap between the two flanges (Fig. 9-16a). Any rotation of the flange, therefore, has little effect on the seal. Figure 9-16b shows the design widely used on the large Saturn engines. The two figures illustrate the difference in size that can be achieved in sealing the same fluid pressure by using the SSME design with high strength material (Inconel 718) for the flanges and the bolts and by measuring the fastener preload with an ultrasonic instrument that measures a change in bolt length.

Restraining mechanism. The restraining de vice provides the force required to keep the flanges together under all operating loads, internal and ex ternal. Internal loads, due to the system pressure, in clude the effects of surges generated by operation of components in the system and by the system opera tion itself. External loads include vibration and mis alignment loads transmitted through the lines or components, torque from rotating machinery, ther mally-induced loads, seal loads, acceleration loads, and the load from the joint-restraining mechanism itself.

To provide the required restraint, a preloaded device seats the seal and exerts a compressive load greater than the separating loads. Insufficient preload will result in leakage if the resilience of the seal can not compensate for the separation that oc curs in operation. Also, a gap between the flanges can result in seal abrasion in an installation sub jected to high vibration. Joint restraining problems have occurred on both cryogenic and hot-gas appli cations as a result of installation preload, loss of preload because of a thermal gradient, and bolt yielding at high temperatures. Such problems are re solved by analyzing the joint and specifying the proper bolt loading.

The restraining mechanisms for flange joints consists of bolts or ring clamps. Most liquid-propel lant rocket engine joints are restrained by bolts be cause of high clamping-load requirements and the large duct diameters, which prohibit the use of threaded couplings. Ring clamps have not been used extensively on rocket engines.

A significant problem with bolted systems has been the inherent inaccuracies in the common methods for preloading bolts. The usual method of torquing with the standard torque wrench is consid ered to be only about 50% accurate because of fric tional variations from unit to unit. This variation limits the design bolt-load to the minimum expected value and does not permit the optimum utilization of the bolt ultimate strength. As a consequence, the joint requires thicker flanges, larger bolts, and more bolts than if a more accurate preload method were used. The high pressures required on the SSME ne cessitates large, heavy joints, and these became a sig nificant weight problem. As noted, the joint design was changed as shown in Fig. 9-16a. In addition, preload for the SSME joint bolts was determined by measuring bolt-length change with an ultrasonic de vice. In this method, a transducer mounted on the bolt head sends a sound pulse down the length of the bolt. The wave reflects from the bolt end back to the transducer. The time for the wave to traverse the length of the bolt and return is determined. The in strument is calibrated to read changes in length as a function of time. The method, however, involves more than bolt-length change, since material density due to strain, bolt bending, and twist also affect the ultrasonic wave travel through the bolt material.

Tempera ture .  The temperature of the fluid greatly affects the type of seal selected and the joint material. Also, the problem of maintaining a leak tight flange joint is compounded by temperature ef fects. Temperature differentials at the flange joints of rocket engines may be large, because of steep heating and flow transients. They introduce thermal stresses and strains that may disturb the sealing. When de signing an elevated-temperature or cryogenic flange joint, the temperatures of the various parts should be analyzed to assess their effect on the sealing load. Ideally, thermal effects should neither loosen nor tighten the joint. In actual design the flange joint must be sufficiently elastic to maintain sealing loads within acceptable limits.

Degree o f  sealing. Most applications require sealing to prevent mass flow under operating condi tions. Joint design integrity can be verified by simu lated operating tests and measuring leakage. Once the joint integrity has been proven, soap-solution leak tests are performed at the assembly levels to ver ify the joints free of leaks. When sealing the lighter gases (H 2 and He), diffusive flow through openings of molecular size may become significant.

Seal. Effectively sealing at the flange surfaces usually requires a material that will readily conform to them, or that as coated with a soft material will form a barrier at the flange interfaces. Seals which damage the flange sealing surfaces are usually unsatis factory, since they prevent resealing. Sealing load at installation must be maintained so that the seal compressive load will withstand internal fluid pres sure without leaking.

Leakage monitoring and seal drainage. A requirement for monitoring joint leakage was imple mented early on the Saturn program. Joint leakage could be monitored on bench, subsystem, static-en gine-firing tests, and, if desired, even on critical joints in flight. Leakage monitoring introduced a low-pres

The secondary seal gives suffi cient resistance to leakage past the primary seal to force flow out through the bleed passage and an at tached flowmeter. These flow passages may also be used to collect leakage past the seal, so that com bustible fluids may be separated and drained to a suitable venting area. Figure 9-18 shows typical moni toring provisions for joints. The SSME did not have leakage-monitoring provisions.

Leakage monitoring entails design penalties. The coupling diameter must be increased to permit a secondary seal inside the bolt circle, enlarging it, thus requiring larger bolts (increased weight).

Flange-Joint Structural Design

Figure 9-19 presents the structural design configura tion of a typical fiat face flange joint as frequently used in rocket engines. The flange ring, under vari ous working loads, is subject to bending as shown ex aggerated by the dotted lines. The bending moments may become quite large; the resulting stresses reach their maximum at corner Z, where the flange joins the wall of the duct.

The basic approach to the design of a flange joint is to prestress the flange bolts in tension so that a gasket compressive stress or seal compression is maintained to seal effectively against fluid leakage, under maximum working pressure and other loads. Defining a flange ring segment of unit length (i.e., 1
in. along the arc of a circle passing through the flange cross-section centroid) as a free body, the cor relations between all forces acting on that segment, and the minimum required design flange bolt load ing, are established as follows:

Maximum working pressure p equals 1750 psia. Equation (9-5) gives the required average gasket compressive-stress, as follows.

Sg = mp = 0.8 x 1750 = 1400 psi

Combine Eqs. (9-3) and (9-8):

F~ = (Fz + F3 + F4)
(1 --n) (9-9a)

Combining this and Eq. (9-4), (9-5), (9-6), and (9-9)
yields the minimum required design bolt loading of the flange joint:

After the required design bolt loading has been de termined, the number, size, and torque value of the bolts needed to produce that load must be chosen. Use of small-diameter, high-strength bolts will be de sirable to gain tensile elasticity. Bolts should be placed sufficiently close to ensure a reasonably even distribution of the load around the gasket circumfer ence. The following empirical correlation is recom mended for maximum spacing to produce a tight joint:

Ps = 2d+T (9-10)

where Ps = maximum bolt spacing, in.; d = nominal bolt diam, in.; and T = flange thickness, in. The gener al proportion of the flange ring may be determined by the following empirical equations (Fig. 9-19):

T = At (9-11)

L1 = Bt (9-12)

where t = thickness of the duct wall as determined by a hoop-stress calculation, in.; L 1 = overall axial length of the flange ring, in.; A = design factor, ranging from
4 to 10; and B = design factor, ranging from 10 to 14. A taper angle of 25 deg is generally used for the hub portion of the flange ring.

The stress-and-strain analysis of the flange ring may be treated as the twisting of a thick circular ring of uniform cross section under the influence of turn ing couples uniformly distributed along a circle pass ing through the centroid of the ring cross-section. The following correlations approximate the maxi mum working stress and strain of a flange ring (see Fig. 9-19):

Figure 9-16 presents the structural design configu ration of a flanged joint used throughout the SSME in the high-pressure system. A modified ASME flange, this design has been optimized for minimum joint weight. The design maintains contact between a sur face on one flange and the mating surface on the other flange under all operating conditions by prop er use of bolt loads. The design offers nearly constant fastener loading under pressurized and nonpressurized condition and minimum flange de flection at the sealing surface, which results in main taining the sealing load. The flange size is kept small by positioning the bolts on the smallest practical bolt circle and making the flange outside diameter tangent to the bolt heads.

The flanges have been structurally verified with proven structural computer-programs. This includes determining stress levels, bolting requirements, and flange deflections. The flange joint carriers all ap plied loads through the load pilot, which is the only contact between mating flanges. When the bolts are installed, the contact point is compressed and the outside diameters of the flanges rotate toward each other. The seal contact surface, being adjacent to the load contact-point, keeps flange rotation low and produces a negligible effect on seal deflection and seal load. Flange deflection is under 0.002 in. for each flange and within the seal-deflection capability of 0.006 in. for the pressure-assisted seal. When ex ternal loads are applied, the flange contact load de creases to a minimum of 10% of the installed load. The maximum bolt load occurs at installation and remains nearly constant during operation, thus re ducing bolt fatigue.

Preliminary flange-joint sizing criteria have been developed for the SSME-type flange shown in Fig. 9 20. Listed below are the ground rules used for sizing this type of joint:

1) Flange deflections at the sealing diameter due to pressure will not exceed 0.002 in. (maximum)
per flange.

2) Seal groove dimensions (pressure assisted seal) will be as follows:

Static Seals for Flange Joints

Early rocket engines used seals available from indus trial applications. These included elastomeric O rings, flat-sheet gaskets of asbestos fibers with rubber binder, spiral-wound gaskets of asbestos, and pre formed steel ribbons. Over the years, operating conditions on engines have become much more se verewseeing pressures up to 10,000 psi and tempera tures from-423 to 1400"Fmand thus created the need for development of new metal seals, including metal O-rings and pressure-assisted seals. Flat-sheet and spiral-wound gaskets are no longer recommended for use on rocket engines since they are prone to leakage at all pressures, the leakage increasing at higher pres sures and at temperature extremes. Asbestos fibers are avoided because of their environmental impact. In spiral-wound gaskets, the metal ribbons can mar the flange surfaces on aluminum and corrosion-resis tant steels, forcing a refinishing of the flange sealing surfaces or even component replacement.

Considerations in seal selection or seal design include resilience (spring back), installation load, en vironment of media to be sealed (including tempera ture, pressure, and fluid compatibility), and cost. Ideally, a universal seal for a rocket engine would be very resilient so it could conform to flange-surface waviness and accommodate flange separation and deflection; have low installation load to minimize impact on bolt and flange designs; be effective at both low (-423"F) and high (1400"F) temperatures; be operational at pressures to 10,000 psi; be compatible with all engine fluids such as propellants, hydraulic fluids, and combustion gases; and be low in cost.

The importance of trouble-free and leak-free static-seal joints in spacecraft cannot be overempha sized. The consequences of leakage include fire and explosion hazards, freezing of fluid or equipment ad jacent to a leak, overpressurization of an engine compartment on the vehicle, and degradation of en gine performance because of loss of specific impulse.

Elas tomer  seals. The elastomer O-ring, the simplest seal, has proven the most reliable when the flanged joint is properly designed. The inexpensive O-ring will usually be the first seal choice if the elas tomer is compatible with the environment.

Elastomer O-rings have been used with good re sults in rocket-engine joints in the temperature range between -30 and 400"F. At temperatures lower than room temperature, the elastomers become hard and at -60"F all of the various elastomer compounds lose the resilience that permits them to conform to the flange surfaces. For low-temperature service (below
0F), elastomers should be selected by an evaluation of the different compounds  for low-temperature properties, such as flexibility, resilience, compression set, and hardness. The upper temperature limit for elastomers is based on heat deterioration of the elas tomer. Selection of an elastomer compound for high-temperature service should be based on proper ties at the service temperature and should include volume reduction, increase in hardness, and com pression set.

In O-ring sealing, a two-step operation, compres sion of the O-ring by the dimensional control of the groove (Fig. 9-21a) makes the initial seal at installa tion. Then, under system pressure, the elastomer acts as a viscous fluid with a high surface tension and is forced to the side of the groove and blocks off the leak path (Fig. 9-21b). An O-ring fails when the gap between the two flanges becomes greater than the O ring can block (Fig. 9-21c). Failures can be elimi nated by one or more of the following: reduce pres sure, increase flange stiffness, or use a harder O-ring material.

Satisfactory results have been experienced at pressure levels as high as 3000 psi. Higher pressures are possible if joint design can control the deflec tions that support the O-ring from extrusion. The in formation in figure 9-22 should be used to select hardness of the O-ring material with respect to work ing pressures. Table 9-5 gives typical elastomer O ring flange-joint design data for use in groove-type flanges, as shown in Fig. 9-23.

Metal O-rings. Properly designed, the metal O ring, a tube formed into a circle with ends welded to gether, can be used at cryogenic temperatures and up to 1200"F or higher when made of high-temperature metal. It can be used at high pressures by drilling vent holes on the pressure side of the tube when used with rigid flanges. The metal O-ring operates differ ently than an elastomer O-ring. The metal O-ring is compressed by the flange load into a groove which controls the deflection, and this deflection produces an interface load sufficient to seal at low pressures. The vent holes permit pressure into the tube, which

the O-ring must be sized to obtain an installation load of 700 lb/in, of length or higher. This requires an O-ring selection based on diameter, tube thick ness, and material properties. Table 9-6 shows the variables required for O-ring sizing plus data on elas tic spring-back (point no seal load if the flange joint has deflection equal to the spring-back). As the flange deflection approaches the spring-back, the joint will be prone to leakage. Metal O-rings must be coated with Teflon, silver, or gold for cryogenic ser vice and silver, gold, or nickel for high-temperature service. Table 9-7 shows typical metal O-ring tube sizes for various O-ring diameters and flange-groove dimensions.

P r e s s u r e - a s s i s t e d  seals .  The pressure-assisted seal was developed to attain a deflection that would better handle deformation of the flange joint under working loads. Figure 9-25 shows two different seal types. The spring effect is achieved by a metal circu lar seal having a U-shaped cross section. The ta pered legs provide a nearly uniform stress in the ma terial. Compressed between the surfaces of the flange joint, the seal tips at the open ends make contact with the flange surfaces and deflect until the flanges make contact. This type of seal permits the seal legs to fol low the flange deflections. The open end of the seal is oriented toward the pressure side of the flange

Seals have been designed and are in ser vice on the SSME with the legs extending outward for sealing an external pressure. Pressure-assisted seals are installed in a concentric groove cut into one of the flanges. This limits the amount of total flange preload transmitted through the contact points of the seal.

324 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES coating material provides the properties needed to establish the intimate contact required to prevent leakage between the seal and flange surfaces. To pre vent leakage, sufficient compressive stress must be developed in the coating to make it flow into imper fections on the flange surfaces.

The seal-tip load will be limited by the coating applied to the seal. Teflon coating will extrude to the point of cutting through and causing leakage if the load exceeds approximately 150 lb/in, of seal cir cumference at installation and 450 lb/in, when pres surized with a cryogenic fluid for the configuration. Silver and gold plating require higher seal-tip bear ing pressures to cause it to flow, and can withstand a much larger load when pressurized. Seal-tip load runs approximately 300 lb/in, of seal circumference at installation and can be over 1000 lb/in, when pres surized.

INTERCONNECTING COMPONENTS AND MOUNTS 325

To prevent leakage, the surface finish on the flanges must have a 32 (rms) roughness with a circu lar lay (approximately circular relative to the center of the surface, similar to a phonograph record). If the flange configuration does not permit this type of finish, an 8 rms multi-directional lay has been de termined to be an acceptable alternate. The sealing surfaces must be free of defects such as machine steps, tool gouges, scratches, material tears, and pits for the seal to function without leakage. Teflon coat ing is softer and more forgiving of defects on the flanges than silver, and Teflon-coated seals have a lower installation load, which translates into lower flange loading.

Many versions of pressure-assisted seals have been used on rocket engines. Rocketdyne developed the Naflex-type pressure-assisted seals with the early seal designs made of alloy steel, nickel-plated and coated with a layer of Teflon. Later designs used Inconel 718 with Teflon, silver, or gold. The Teflon coated seals are effective for cryogenic service ( 430F). Silver- and gold-plated seals are used for cryogenic and hot-gas service (1700"F). The Teflon coated seals are limited to 3000 psi; the silver- and gold-plated seals are effective at pressures greater than 10,000 psi. Design details and data for typical cryogenic and hot gas seals and flange joints are given in Fig. 9-25 and table 9-8.

9.4 DESIGN OF FIXED JOINTS

Fixed joints are nonseparable connections of fluid system components. Since it is impractical to make line assemblies in one piece from end to end be cause of requirements to insert specially formed or machined parts such as elbows, tees, bosses, and valves, fixed joints are a necessary design element. Complexity, cost, and the effect on reliability keep the number of such joints to a minimum within a line. Fixed joints can be made by welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, and soldering. However, welding is the preferred method. Problems that make brazed joints a second choice to welding include close di mensional tolerances of component  parts, inade quate cleaning, which reduces braze wettability
(ability of braze alloy to adhere to the surface), built in crevices that can trap contamination and act as stress concentrations, intergranular carbide penetra tion of line material, and inability to inspect for proper braze coverage with non-destructive testing. Diffusion bond ing - -a  unique method for joining some widely different metals by the use of controlled temperature and pressure---does not have many ap plications in rocket-engine ducting to date. Soldered joints have very low strength and some of the same problems associated with brazing.

Welding, the most common and recommended method of joining the various duct components, produces joints with mechanical properties and envi ronmental and propellant compatibility characteris tics similar to the components being joined. A butt weld does not contribute to the system contamina tion and does not have a built-in crevice. Welded joints are usually made on a bench, but they can be made as final-installation joints. The type of welded joints which have been used in fluid-system lines are illustrated in Fig. 9-26. The butt, fillet, and sleeve weldsmthe  most commonmsomet imes  are used in combination, as shown in Fig. 9-26f. Butt welds are bench-fabrication joints and are the recommended

Butt-weld joints are used extensively on rocket engines including the J-2, F-l, and the SSME.

In-place joints normally used on small tube lines
(< 1 in.) have the sleeve-weld configuration shown in Fig. 9-26e because of the self-aligning feature of this type joint. Sections of tubing can be cut out of a line assembly for tube repair or for installing different components  or fittings by use of the in-place sleeve joint. Sleeve welds are used to join thin-wall tubing where the sleeve must be added to achieve the thick ness for practical welding. They entail the following disadvantages:

 Unless all crevices can be eliminated by de sign, as in Fig. 9-26f, the resulting built-in crack will act as a stress raiser and lower fatigue life.

 The longitudinal forces in the tube will load the weld in shear.

 Unless all can be eliminated by design, as in Fig. 9-26f, crevices provide a collector for contami nants and corrosive materials.

 Radiographic inspection of the weld proves relatively difficult.

The F-1 engine used the combination fil let/sleeve weld (Fig. 9-26d) extensively on tube sizes of 1-in. in diam or less. The fillet was added because of line failures due to the high vibration experienced on this engine. The sleeve weld with separate sleeve
(Fig. 9-26e) was predominant on the J-2 tube lines and the combination fillet/sleeve (Fig. 9-26f) was used in some instances of high vibration. When the B-nut type of coupling was used (for instrumentation lines), machined sleeve-tube stubs were attached to tubing with the welded-sleeve design of Fig. 9-26e. Weld joints are located in low-vibration areas when possible. Welds with vibration normal to the tube axis should be avoided. Clearance around the exte rior of the joint must be provided for in-place weld ing equipment. The number of joints should be kept to a minimum consistent with overall system re quirements.

9.5 BELLOWS AND FLEX JOINTS

Introduct ion

Bellows joints are the critical design and perfor mance members of the flexible-line assembly. A bellows section in a line usually consists of three parts: a flexible pressure-carrying convoluted tube
(the bellows), a restraint on the bellows to handle the pressure-separating load, and a provision for attach ing the bellows to the line. Straight-sidewall, annu larly-convoluted bellows with tension-type, pressure separation,  load-restraint l inkages are the most commonly used designs. Typical bellows joints are shown in Fig. 9-27. References 9-15 through 9-25 pro vide recommended information on the design and use of bellows.

Different deflection modes (i.e., axial, angular, and shear) produce the same type of bending stresses in the bellows convolutions. If a bellows must deflect in all of these modes simultaneously, the sum of the deflections for all modes must be kept within acceptable stress limits. (Reference 9-26 pre sents methods for converting different types of bel lows deflection into equivalent axial deflection.)
Therefore, the duct system will be routed so as to keep all accumulated deflection stresses within the safe working stress value of the material and meet the required fatigue life.

Torsional loading (twist about the duct longitudi nal centerline) should be avoided in the design and application of a duct system. When, because of de sign constraints, torsional loading is unavoidable, the torsional effects should be minimized by appropriate design, such as introduction of slip plates and tor sional bellows or slip-limiting flanges.

If space limitations force a duct to be designed relatively short and straight, so that torsional deflec tions cannot be absorbed through anRulation of bel

Friction between the braid and the bellows can be minimized by applying solid film dry lubricant to the outer surface of the bellows and the inner (or all) surfaces of the braid. Care must be exercised in the selection of the dry lubri cant to ensure compatibility with the end-use fluids. Flex hoses are acceptable for use in both high and low temperature and pressure extremes.

Slide joint .  A slide joint is a variation of a bel lows with an internal flow sleeve except that the bel lows is isolated from the flow media and undergoes an external pressure differential. Flow loss with this design is negligible; and since bellows pressure is ex ternal, this type of joint is far less susceptible to squirming. It can absorb axial deflection, shear, and bending forces and can be designed to accommo date angular deflections.

Basic Types

Bellows have been used successfully in vehicle and rocket-engine ducting in a wide range of sizes under a variety of operating conditions. However, success depends on careful design, as bellows generally op erate in the plastic range of the bellows material. This condition is necessary so that the wall thickness can be reduced sufficiently to produce acceptable end-restraint reaction loads with the bellows in a de flected position and to reduce weight.

The pressure-separating load on a bellows in a duct system is developed, as if the bellows were a pressure vessel with end caps, by the duct pressure reacting against a projected area across the duct bore
(e.g., an elbow, an injector face, or any other reaction point in the system). Bellows have low spring rates and thus cannot withstand very-high-pressure separat ing loads without changing length. Therefore, re straint mechanisms to prevent this change must be used to enable the bellows to perform its function in a duct assembly.

Formed, straight sidewall bellows predominantly see use in aerospace ducting. Welded-disk bellows, the other major type, are not used in any aerospace ducting.

There are four basic types of bellows manufac tured: formed, welded, machined, and deposi ted- the formed being by far the most predominant . Table 9-10 describes typical applications of each type. Convolution shapes are many and varied. tional loads on the bellows that must be accounted for in the joint design.

Ball Joints .  This type of joint design provides a gimbal-type restraint and motion while applying a uniform circumferential load in the mating assembly. The bellows in this design is enveloped with a spher ical inner and outer race separated by ball bearings. The bellows can receive excellent external protection by the external-restraint assembly.

Figure 9-29 shows the major shapes and methods of fabrication, and gives a brief description of charac teristics.

Omega joints .  Omega or toroidal joints are not used extensively in aerospace ducting systems be cause of the difficulty in incorporating some means of selfrestraint against the unbalanced pressure force. Figure 9-30a depicts an untied omega joint; the pres sure force must be restrained by the mounting struc ture. It has the attractive characteristic of hoop stress being a function of the omega cross-sectional and not its full diameter (Ref. 9-27).

W e l d e d - d i s c  b e l l o w s .  In rocket engines, welded disc bellows have been limited to rotary-face seal applications as a low-axial-travel loading ele ment. This mechanical face-type seal incorporates a welded metallic bellows in place of the more com monly used spring and elastomeric packing. The bel lows can be made from any weldable material and usually has low spring-rate, negligible hysteresis, and great compactness. It can be designed for pressure systems up to 2000 psig and temperature extremes ranging from -425 to 1500"F. The major disadvantage of welded disc bellows is that by nature of fabrication each ID and OD weld has a built-in notch that is sus ceptible to premature failure unless kept to low mag nitudes of stress. These welds have lineal length 30 to
40 times that of a bellows made from a tube with a single butt weld. At present, no nondestructive methods can examine and verify the integrity of the ID and OD welds.

Formed bellows.  Extensively used in aerospace systems, convoluted bellows serve both high- and low-pressure liquid and gas systems at high- and low temperature extremes. They maintain positive seal ing characteristics and can be designed to deflect ax ially, angularly, or laterally. They can be made from most available materials and in unlimited sizes and wall thicknesses. The bellows can be either single- or multiple-ply depending on the application. This type of bellows may be restrained internally or externally, or may be of the free type.

Root rings.  When design pressures are high, it may be impractical to design the root of the convo lution to resist the effects of pressure. Thicker bel lows walls, required to resist high pressure, produce higher spring rates and attendant lower fatigue life when exposed to repeated flexings. In such cases, root rings (Fig. 9-31) are sometimes used to assist in carrying the pressure load.

The root ring must have sufficient area to carry the hoop tension loads and, if hollow, must also re sist the bending loads applied to the ring wall by pressure. The deflection-limiting root rings (Fig. 9 31b) are sometimes used in aerospace ground facili ties. They permit thin-wall bellows and, thereby, low

Machined b e l l o w s .  Typically applied in in strument systems and check valves and as null-bal ance springs in servo-mechanisms, this kind of bel lows can be machined from most materials, includ ing aluminum, and can be designed for use at high and low-temperature extremes and high and low pressures. Made in sizes ranging from 5/16 in. to 3 ft in diam, it can be used with an internal or external gimbal. Fatigue life will usually be high due to the absence of forming stresses and the low spring rates achieved through deep convolution machining. Wall thickness can be varied in given areas to suit design requirements.

Deposited be l lows .  This type of bellows usu ally serves the need for extremely-low spring rates. Wall thicknesses of deposited bellows can be as low as 0.0003 in. They are used mainly for instrument systems.

Rigidized tubing. This type of "bellows"--what might by termed a partially formed bellows--typ cially stiffens a spool piece that separates a double bellows joint; and it can be used in a rigid-tube as sembly to accommodate slight misalignment. It has been used with great success in thin-walled double bellows assemblies where the line assembly is sub jected to handling damage.

Pressure Capability

A bellows must withstand several kinds of operational pressure: normal operating, surge, proof [(normal operating pressure + surge pressure) times safety factor], and burst (proof pressure times safety factor)

These pressures produce both hoop stresses in the bellows and stresses that tend to bulge the convo lution sidewalls. The bellows must be stable and re sist column buckling under the proof-pressure appli cation.

The calculated operational stresses are very high, exceeding the yield strengths of the materials, but in reality are only index stresses and must be treated as such. Table 9-11 gives the limiting bulging stresses and allowable motion stresses (bending stresses) of frequently-used bellows materials. Cycles-life tests apply full-stress reversals at a frequency of 30-60/min.

The following expression can be used to deter mine additive bending stresses in the convolution crowns and roots caused by simultaneous application of pressure and deflection, assuming the maximum stress to be the one from only one of the effects:

Jb + JB 2
NJ b,max/ BTm;x ~ 1

where Jr, = bending stress (motion stress) and J8 =
bulging stress.

The major problems with bellows in ducting on large liquid-propellant rocket engines have been the following: fatigue failures (due to mechanical and flow vibration and possibly contributed to by han dling abuse), buckling stability (internal and exter nal), corrosion, manufacturing difficulties, handling damage, and, less frequently, implosions in LOX, hy drogen, or high temperature service and bursting due to pressure surge.

Fatigue Life

The end-point motions of a flexible-duct assembly impose the largest deflections on the bellows joints within the duct. These motions, like the anticipated duty cycle, can be predicted in the design phase. With the use of this information and the S-N
(alternating stress vs. number of cycles) properties for the particular materials involved, the bellows then can be designed for an adequate low-cycle fatigue life while operating under very high stresses. Since aerospace design emphasizes light weight, thin walls characterize bellows. They reduce the weight of the bellows itself and also reduce spring rates, so that the reaction loads on attaching members stay low and thus keep weight to a minimum. This thin-wall feature dictates that the bellows operate under stresses near or in the plastic range; i.e., in the low-cycle range affecting fatigue life.

Other motions imparted to the bellows come from vibrations induced mechanically or by the fluid flow. The bellows must be designed so that stresses stay below the endurance limit of the material (i.e., no reduction in fatigue life caused by vibration).

Methods for predicting flow-induced vibration inputsmas presented in Ref. 9-29 through 9-36--en able the designer to develop a bellows completely free from vibration or at least free from unacceptable levels of vibration.



INTERCONNECTING COMPO N EN TS AND MOUNTS 333

Vibration susceptibility. Structural integrity must be maintained during and after the operational periods, when many types of dynamic loads may be applied to a bellows. The types of loads include those generated by the enclosed fluids (e.g., pressure surging such as Pogo, water hammer, pump oscil lations, and f low-induced vibration) and those imposed by mechanical environments (e.g., sinu soidal vibration, random vibration, shock, noise, and steady-state acceleration).

Bellows experience three primary modes of vi bration (Fig. 9-32): the axial or accordion mode, the lateral mode, and the mode in which the individual convolutions rotate back and forth at the inner di ameter while pivoting about the outer diameter. The individual convolution mode (Fig. 9-32c) is especially noticeable in f low-induced vibration of braided hoses, where the convolution outer diameter is re strained by the braid friction and thus provides a fixed pivot point for the convolution being excited by flow forces.

For a given bellows design, the frequencies of these modes can be predicted with reasonable accu racy. The difficult problems concern determining the frequencies and amplitudes of flow or mechani cal vibratory forces that may excite these modes and the possible response characteristics of the bellows to these forces.

Flow- induced  v ibra t ion .  Flow-induced vibra tion of flexible-line bellows, with resultant fatigue failure, frequently plagues lines containing fluids flow ing at high velocity. In bellows, an internal flow liner has always resolved the problem by preventing im pingement of the flow stream on the convolutions. However, the installation of the liner usually presents complications in design and fabrication and makes the bellows more difficult to clean. The liners them selves have sometimes failed, apparently as a result of vibration. Flow liners appear to be the best solu tion to flow-induced vibration, particularly if incor porated early in the design, to avoid "quick fixes" or
"add-ons" that are more difficult to integrate once the duct configuration has been established.

Flow-induced-vibration analysis determines the dynamic response and fluid excitation required to

The essential dynamic fact concerns the response characteristics for the in dividual convolution mode being the consequence of a coupling of the structural dynamics of the convolu tions and the dynamics of the fluid within the convo lutions. The excitation due to fluid flow within the flexible line can excite a band of response frequen cies having the boundaries of the excitation frequen cies proportional to velocity. The low-frequency ex citations generally are associated with vortex shed ding within the turbulent boundary layer. The high frequency (and potentially much stronger) excitation is associated with a convection frequency in the tur bulent boundary layer. The convection frequency is defined as the characteristic frequency associated with the fluid velocity past equally-spaced wall irregu larities (the convolutions).

Acoustic loading can increase the number of de grees of freedom of a bellows system by coupling the bellows to the acoustic modes. That can propagate very significant pressure fluctuations throughout the fluid system. These acoustic resonances, in addition to producing noise, significantly increase the flow-in duced stress levels, apparently owing to the acoustics resonance flow and pressure fluctuations coupling with the vortex-shedding process to produce a force amplification (see Ref. 9-31 and 9-35).

If a resonance can exist, the analysis provides a technique for estimating the energy levels associated with the resonance; and the energy available can then be translated to a stress level in the part. When the expected stress level is known, a quantitative eval uation then can be made to determine if the stress level exceeds the alternating stress that the part can withstand without high-cycle fatigue failure.

The detailed analytical methods for determining flow-induced vibration excitation and response dy namics are presented in Ref. 9-29 and 9-36. The ana lytical methods allow determining, with a high confi dence level, the flow-induced vibration susceptibility of a given flexible-line design for a given set of oper ating conditions while still in the design phase. These techniques thus eliminate the need for expensive cut and-try flow testing of prototype hardware.

Mechanically-induced vibration. The vibra tion-response characteristics for a given mechanical excitation input can be calculated just as for flow-in duced vibration. It is relatively simple to predict flow-induced-excitation inputs, but extremely difficult to predict the mechanical-excitation amplitudes and frequencies of the components or system in which the bellows will be installed.

Double-bellows spoolpiece arrangements (Fig. 9 27c) with an undamped or unsupported span show vulnerability to vibration of the long unsupported mass from both flow-induced and mechanical excita tion. The initial design of the discharge duct on the pump for a particular engine incorporated this con figuration; and fatigue cracks attributed to vibration occurred in its bellows. The condition was intensi fied by stress raisers in the form of wrinkles found on the inside radius of the convolutions. These wrinkles were attributed to an overly small ratio of bellows convolution radius to thickness.

Design of  Bellows for Flexible Ducts

There are many acceptable approaches to the design of bellows, and the majority of them can reasonably predict characteristics, the most significant being the spring rate and the ability to perform for a given number of cycles, or "life." Many other factors must be taken into account as stated before, such as sus ceptibility to flow-induced vibration and fabricability limits.

Spring rates for multiple bellows prove particu larly difficult to predict due to friction forces between plies and effects of forming techniques on the actual convolution shapes. Convoluted bellows can be made from most available materials and in an al most unlimited number of sizes and wall thicknessess. The bellows can be of single or multiple ply depend ing on application. To adequately design a bellows for a particular application requires knowledge of some basic elements: operating pressures, tempera tures, flow rates, deflections, operating fluids (and characteristics), and a reasonable idea of the number of "safe" cycles required. The envelope limitations must be defined. One of the most significant prob lems will be simply identifying the governing param eters. Generally speaking, envelope will be a major concern, with the available length in a pipe and the adjacent structures dictating maximum envelope. Since ideally it will not add to the overall constraints of the engine design, the bellows will be small and light, and generate low reacting loads--in most de signs. Table 9-12 offers guidance on various effects bellows geometry may have on aspects of reacting loads, life, and envelope.

Structural fatigue due to cyclic s tressing-- the most common mode of failure for metal-bellows ex pansion joints used in ducting--usually takes the form of circumferential cracks in the roots or crowns of the convolutions with consequent leakage of the contained fluid. Most bellows will have relatively short fatigue life because they are designed to operate in the plastic stress range to minimize spring rates and attendant reaction loads on connecting ducts and structure. This is specially true in missile and space vehicle applications where weight is at a premium. Low-cycle fatigue life, primarily a function of bending stress in the convolutions, will be relatively independent of steady-state stresses, such as bulging stress in side wall of convolution and hoop stresses due to internal pressure. Thus, the expected life of a new design can be approximated before fabricating and testing the part.

The envelope decided (life length and inside di ameter), other parameters will have to be manipu lated to conform to the desired requirements: (as a minimum) performance of the bellows and deflec tions to be absorbed (axial, angular, or offset). Considerations of weight and life will often dictate the material to be used, and cost and producibility of the bellows will also be factored out on the final de sign. In general, multiply bellows made of thick ma terial will tax most forming equipment and methods. Reasonable lengths will prevent special material-join ing techniques, which at best will add unpredictable discontinuities and increased nondestructive-testing costs. The detailed methods and examples for calcu lating spring rate, pressure-separating loads, friction forces, stress analysis, fatigue life, damage analysis, buckling instability, and vibration susceptibility go beyond the scope of this presentation. Publications dealing with these subjects can be found in the litera ture (e.g., Ref. 9-37 and 9-38.)

Bellows Restraint

M e c h a n i c a l  linkages. The most commonly used restraint employs the gimbal-ring joint (or uni versal). Other concepts include the hinged joint, ball joint, and braided sheath. Referring back to the opening section, Table 9-9 describes a broad spec trum of design.

The gimbal ring joint, the "workhorse" of bellows restraints, can be designed to withstand extremely high pressures and temperatures, allows angular de flection in all planes, and will withstand torsional loads. Stops to prevent excessive bellows angulation are readily adaptable to this design. The load-carry ing pivot pins may be designed for either single- or double-shear support, the choice depending on the separating load. The same comments apply to the hinged joint, which provides angulation in one plane only.

A subtlew of gimballed bellows, sometimes over looked even by experienced duct designers, is the fact that a gimbal (or universal) joint, when deflected about both of its axes simultaneously, produces a tor sional deflection. Motion is not transmitted with a constant angular-velocity ratio unless the intersection of driving and driven components lies in a homoki netic plane. Gimbal-ring linkages do not have this type of geometry, and therefore induce a torsional deflection. The normal rigidity of gimballed bellows in torsion produces high torsional stresses.

One of the most popular and inexpensive meth ods for an external, tension tie restraint--the use of a braided-wire sheath, as in the case of a flexible hose- -can  absorb both angular and shear deflec tions, and acts as a vibration damper for the bellows inside. The braid restricts angular deflection under high pressure by off-center pivoting, which increases bending moments.

Friction between the braid and bellows can be minimized by an adapter, which provides clearance at the end convolutions, and by the application of solid, dry-film lubricant on the outer surface of the bellows and inner surface of the braid. Excessive friction and possible eventual galling of the journal type pin bearings on the linkages present a problem that also can be alleviated with solid, dry-film lubri cants. LOX-compatible lubricants should be used be tween bellows plies and on the bearings of restraint linkages in LOX systems. Data on LOX compatibility of lubricants aid a selection. If data are not available, as on a new product, LOX impact tests are per formed.

Once a gimbal-ring type of bellows restraint has been selected, the question of internal vs. external mounting (Fig. 9-28) must be resolved. In general, the design will have the option of an internal or ex ternal gimbal after design tradeoffs have been made



336 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES on the particular application. Each type has advan tages and disadvantages. The internal gimbal will be more difficult to clean, because all of the mecha nisms come in contact with the flowing fluid and therefore require cleaning. Both gimbals can be
"sleeved" to reduce flow losses; but the conventional internal gimbal ring design has a higher flow-loss co efficient than the external-ring, sleeved-bellows de sign.

If the diameter of an internal gimbal ring at least equals the duct ID, a larger-diameter bellows must encompass the linkage. The larger bellows causes a greater separating load and consequently an increase in linkage weight to carry it. A comparison of the weights of internal and external gimbal designs for a given diameter and pressure cannot be generalized, but rather must be evaluated for each individual de sign case.

The internal chain-tie-link joint, an economical version of the gimbal joint for small or medium pressure-separating loads, weighs less than the equiv alent gimbal, but has the disadvantage of high-flow loss factors due to the frontal area's restriction to flow. Although not suitable for use in systems with high-velocity fluids, this joint has frequently been used in the low-pressure, turbine-gas-duct systems of rocket engines. Link joints also have low torsional strength.

The chain-link joint (Fig. 9-33) does not have a fixed pivot point of the linkage. That peculiarity de pends on the plane in which the joint is angulated. Since the angular deflection is evenly distributed over the live length of the bellows only when that length is centered about the pivot point, this change in pivot-point location with plane of angulation will reduce fatigue life.

With bellows restraints, both gimbal and hinge types, the bellows pressure-separating load often produces reaction in highly localized areas of the duct. Loads concentrated in a point on a member will span the cross section of the member, as de scribed by a 30-45-deg half-angle. When the joint ad joins a flange, the duct will not have the length to al low the concentrated loads to redistribute circumfer entially into the walls of the duct. Consequently, lo calized loads applied to the bolted flange can over load the bolts in the load area or cause deflection in the flange, possibly allowing static leakage of the joint.

Chain-link restraint joint with inter The SSME flexible joints incorporate internal tri pod and external gimbal-ring linkages. The internal type (Fig. 9-34) serves the low-pressure pump-dis charge ducts, where the pressure loss can be tolerated and the overall joint envelope must be kept as small as possible. The external type (Fig. 9-35) serves small-diameter (2.0-2.7-in.), high-pressure ducts, where the pressure losses associated with internal ties are not acceptable. The extremely high pressures and gimbal angles (up to _+13.5 ) of the externally tied joints required the use of bellows' live lengths that were unstable in column buckling. This difficulty necessitated the development of a novel linkage that provided lateral support at the midspan of the bel lows' live length and thereby eliminated a potential buckling instability. The geometry of the design in Fig. 9-35 ensures that the angular deflection of the joint assembly will be distributed equally between the two bellows.

The bending-moment loads required to angulate flexible-joint assemblies can be a significant factor in the design of a duct assembly and the load reactions at the installation and attach points of the duct. A gimballing duct, for example, can add a considerable force requirement to the actuators that apply the moments to gimbal an engine.

Thrust-compensating linkages. The use of a thrust-compensating bellows to offset the thrust of a primary bellows in a duct system (Fig. 9-36 and 9-37)
can be considered as a form of pressure-separating, t

load-restraint mechanism (i.e., a thrust-compensating linkage). This type of bellows assembly allows axial deflection in the same manner as an unrestrained bellows.

The term "pressure volume compensating" (PVC)
duct has come into use in describing this type of joint. This terminology is misleading, since the duct makes no pressure compensation. A more nearly correct description is "thrust compensating," because it is the axial thrust caused by the pressure separating force that is balanced by the compensating bellows. It is axiomatic that, in order to compensate for thrust, the volume must also be compensated;  so this portion of the PVC description is correct. The compensating joint chiefly serves to retain a tension type system in limited space where  axial travel cannot be absorbed by angulation. By proper selec tion of the cross-sectional area of the balance bel lows, the thrust force may be undercompensated, fully compensated, or overcompensated,  so that a compressive, balancing, or tensile load gets imposed on the installation restraints.

The large (+ 50%) volumetric changes incurred in straight-run gimballing ducts correspondingly in cur pressure perturbations that could be detrimental to engine operation. The thrust-compensating design eliminates these pressure variations. This design concept was used in all ducts to the pump inlets of the five F-1 engines of the Saturn S-IC vehicle. As the engines respond to thrust-vector control, these ducts must deliver an axial stroke of as much as +50% of the live length of the compensator bellows. Without the PVC feature, the volume change of the system could cause corresponding pressure pulses and vari able loading on the pump inlets. Consistent engine performance depends on uniform supply of propel lants to the pumps. The PVC design maintains a constant system volume under all engine-gimballing conditions.

The thrust-compensating design shown in Fig. 9 38 has axial bellows of the same cross-sectional area, with operating pressure applied to the outside sur faces of both. The internal volume of the bellows second from the left in the figure is vented to atmo sphere. The outer shell over both center bellows acts as the linkage that restrains the forces separating the two. The joints on either end of the duct are of the internally-tied, angulating type and complete the util ity of the duct assembly. This externally pressurized configuration permits the use of axial bellows with lower spring rate than can be used with pressure ap plied internally to bellows, because a given bellows design will have higher critical buckling pressure with external pressure than with internal.

Compression system. A compression system has free bellows, without tension tie linkages, that ab sorb the operational deflections in a duct system. The pressure-separating and spring-rate forces of the bellows then must be reacted by the mating attach ment of the engine or airframe; this reaction places the ducting in compression.

In ducting systems with compression-restrained bellows (e.g., low-pressure systems), the engine or ve hicle-support structure can be overloaded with mo ments (in bellows, shear deflections) caused by ec centric pressure-separating loads from the bellows. This problem can be minimized by aligning the thrust vector of the bellows with the reaction points of the attaching structure. If the operational deflec tions of the bellows are predictable and repeatable, the bellows can be installed in an opposite deflection position so that it moves toward a neutral (and lower stress) position while in operation. Fig. 9-39 shows this type of installation.

Bellows-to-duct Attachment

The present practice of joining bellows made of thin, sometimes laminated, and often dissimilar materials to adjacent, more-massive parts requires careful manufacturing techniques. Weld fixturing for proper fitup, use of chill blocks, and automatic welding where possible must all be carefully planned, designed, and

338 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES applied. Electron- or laser-beam welding and diffu sion bonding offer advantages for joining dissimilar metals and widely different wall thicknesses in addi tion to minimizing the effect on heat-treat properties because of confined heat input. Heat-treatable alloy bellows can be welded to non-heat-treatable alloy ducts without disturbing the heat-treat condition in the bellows material. This attachment can be made by welding a transition section of the duct alloy to the bellows before heat treating so that the final weld to the duct involves identical alloys.

The welded junctions of bellows to ducts (usually thicker walled than the bellows) can cause high dis continuity stresses. Butt-welded connections, which are as thick as the bellows wall at the weld and gradu ally taper to the tube thickness, appreciably reduce stresses resulting from thermal shock. This type of welded connection also reduces discontinuity stresses resulting from radial pressure. The cobra-head hood
(Fig. 9-40a) of the H-1 turbine exhaust demonstrated fatigue failure in a weld joint from thermal cycling with mechanical vibration superposed. Fatigue cracks and eventual leakage repeatedly occurred in its sand wich-joint design (Fig. 9-40b). Thermal and stress analyses of the design indicated that high cyclic thermal stresses at engine start and cutoff, due to the large temperature gradient across the laminated structure, were causing the failures. The butt-welded forged Y-ring design (Fig. 9-40c), in which lamina tions of material in a high-heat-flux region are elimi nated (to reduce the thermal gradient) and all welds are Class I, proved to be the design solution, as demonstrated by successful test evaluation.

Resistance seam welding, although the least ex pensive and quickest way to join thin-wall bellows to thin-wall ducts (<0.090-in. wall), does present some problems. During the circumferential seam-welding operation, the clearance between the mating parts is gathered into a single large gap as the roller elec trodes approach the 360-deg closeoff point (Fig. 9 41). Too large a gap will prevent the electrodes from forcing the two parts together for an adequate weld. Close fitup (i.e., careful sizing of the parts to be joined) and intermittent resistance spot welding around the circumference of overlapping parts be fore welding constitute a fundamental requirement for a structurally acceptable joint.

Radiography can be used, but the film is difficult to interpret because of the built-in cracks adjacent to each side of the weld nugget.

Fusion butt-welds (burndown) welds are prefer able to resistance welds, but require very accurate jig ging and tooling to align the butting edges. Butt welds can be inspected radiographically, and they are structurally superior to resistance welds, since the weld is loaded in tension, not in shear, as in the resis tance type.

Joining bellows to ducting sometimes unavoid ably must employ induction brazing, a useful method when the joint otherwise proves inaccessible.

Flow Liners

Internal liners (sleeves) for bellows solve the prob lem of fatigue failure brought about by flow-induced vibration. Liners also can reduce the pressure loss of a bellows joint. They have been used as structural members supporting tube coils in the engine heat exchangers. The liners themselves are not without problems, however. Liners must be designed such that, with the bellows at the maximum limits of excur Area O! Attachment

Figure 9-42 shows typical flow-liner configurations.

Liners in which cracks appeared in the trailing edge and in the weld joint have exhibited fatigue fail ure attributed to vibration modes of the cantilevered end of the sleeve. Increasing the wall thickness, which increased the rigidity of the liner, solved this problem.

Liners have collapsed from pressure on the outer diameter  exceeding that on the inner diameter. Collapse was attributed to sudden changes in flowrate that cause a differential static pressure across the liner wall. Since liner usually has a diameter smaller than the  attaching duct's, the liner section behaves like a venturi, and rapid changes in flowrate cause static-pressure changes in the liner section. If the static pressures on either side of the liner do not sta bilize quickly, a momentary differential can be in duced on the liner wall and cause collapse. Vent holes in the liner can relieve some of this pressure differential, or the liner can be strengthened to with stand the applied load.

9.6 FLEXIBLE HOSE

The industrial experience in braided flexible hose provided a starting point for advancing the technol ogy to the state required for space-vehicle applica tions. However, as in the case of bellows joints, pres sure ratings in the sizes needed were unheard ofmfor example, the procurement  of commercial braided metal hose of 3.0- and 3.5-in. diam made of 321 CRES for 750-psi operational pressure in the original Atlas booster engine design. This pressure level greatly exceeds the commercial rating and left little or no margin of safety. These hoses, however, were used for initial engine tests, and pressure ratings eventually were increased by modifying the design to meet aerospace requirements. Thousands of hoses in this size have now been used for both cryogenic-oxidizer and hydrocarbon-fuel applications in rocket engines.

Routing

The same practices for routing ducts or lines gener ally apply to assemblies of braided flexible hose, ex cept that all systems are of the tension type. The de signer wants a minimum number of flexible sections in an assembly, and positions them to achieve the maximum line motion possible with minimum mo tion of the flexible section.

Figure 9-43 shows a typical configuration for flex ible-hose assembly that displays sound design prac tice. The assembly is for a rocket engine with a thrust-chamber head-mounted gimbal used for thrust vector control. The entire wraparound lies in the gimbal plane. For two of the three flexible sections, the longitudinal centerlines lie in the gimbal plane. The center of the live length of each of these two flexible sections is located on each of the gimbal axes. A third flexible section is located in the verti cal leg to provide universal motion of one end of the line with respect to the other. When the gimbal mo tion is fixed and limited to two planes normal to each other ( including corner angle), the third
(vertical) hose may be omitted, with consequent sav ings of weight  and reduction of envelope. This method of locating the flexible sections limits their motions to the gimbal angle only, thereby minimiz ing bending stresses and attendant fatigue.

Hoses not inherently stiff enough to resist mo tions imparted by mechanical vibration or undesir able displacements due to acceleration loads can be given clamps and support brackets, strategically lo cated, as dampers.

Other configurations have been used for crossing the gimbal plane when lack of available installation space prevented the wraparound approach. The en gine-to-vehicle interface flex lines of the J-2 engine are a case in point. These lines were arranged in L shaped  routing configurations with a section of braided flexible hose in each leg of the L shape.



340 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

A considerable amount of test data has been ac cumulated on the flow losses through flexible metal hoses (Ref. 9-39 through 9-41) and used in the design phase of a new application. The pressure drop in a convoluted inner core is 10 to 15 times as much as for a hard tube of comparable diameter. Bends in flexible hose elements are avoided where possible. The references show that, for comparable geometries, the ratio of the pressure-loss factor for a convoluted elbow to straight convoluted section greatly exceeds the ratio of pressure loss factor for plain tube elbow to straight tube. In addition to the pressure-drop dis advantages, the bent flexible configuration maintains a steady-state deflection stress on the part in an in stalled position that can adversely influence fatigue life.

Sizing

Current practices in sizing flexible hose involve the same general considerations used for sizing lines. Analyses of pressure loss (Ref. 9-39 through 9-41) and flow-induced vibration (Ref. 9-30 through 9-36) are better methods for avoiding problems with either phenomenon.

As standard design practice, manufacturers of flexible metal hose make the innercore ID greater than the attaching tube's ID. This procedure intro duces expansion and contraction losses that must be traded off against hose pressure losses for an accept able total loss.

Inner-core Behavior

Analysis of flexible-hose innercore for flow- and me chanically-induced vibration follows the attack for bellows, with the exception that the braid restrains the convolutions to vibrate individually. Other con siderations for flexible hoses, such as pressure capa bility and corrosion resistance, are similar to those for bellows.

Temperature extremes experienced by compo nents in a rocket-engine system usually will exempt a nonmetal hose from consideration. Even if the hose qualifies otherwise to convey a particular fluid, prox imity to hot or cold running components, placement in view of the exhaust plume, exposure to exhaust blowback, a test stand fire, or exposure to cryogenic temperature could cause failure of a nonmetal hose. These adversities seldom pose problems with metal hoses.

The methods of stress analysis for bellows also apply to annularly-convoluted metal innercore, the predominant type of pressure-carrying member  in aerospace flexible hoses. However, it cannot be as sumed that the total live length will be active in bending. The "Chinese finger trick" effect of the braid, which causes a compressive load on the inner core OD, plus the bottoming out of the braid wires in bending, do not permit a smooth arc (constant-ra dius) deflection of the innercore.

The moment  required to bend a flexible hose may affect adjacent components. For example, low ering the bending moments  of flexible hoses that cross the engine gimbal plane reduces the actuator

Lubricants ap plied to braid wires and the outer surfaces of the in nercore reduce bending moments. Compressing the innercore axially before installing the braid results in more convolutions per inch and a lower bending stiffness at the expense of increased weight and mate rial cost. Innercore compression also improves the ability of the hose to withstand pressure impulses.

Buckling stability in the design of flexible hose does not draw the concern it does for bellows. The support that the braid provides for the innercore prevents buckling unless end attachments (on instal lation) prevent the braid from pulling taut when the hose is pressurized.

Manually operated disconnects normally contain a check or shutoff valve in each half; the valve is forced open mechanically by the connecting opera tion. Figure 9-44 illustrates this action. In some ap plications (e.g., purging from the ground) a pressure actuated valve may be used in the vehicle half. Figure 9-44 shows the spillage volume in a typical manually-operated disconnect design.

9.7 GIMBAL-MOUNT ASSEMBLIES

Gimbals permit the engine to be angulated for thrust vector control of the vehicle. Most turbopump-fed engine systems (Fig. 3-2, 3-4, and 9-1) have gimbals that are universal joints with provisions for mounting



INTERCONNECTING COMPONENTS AND MOUNTS 34 1

Fig. 9-45 Typical ring-type gimbal mount de signed for low-thrust, upper-stage engine. normally at the vehicle interface on one side and the engine on the other side. In addition to the angula tion function, the gimbal must transmit engine thrust and all resulting loads to the vehicle. The angulation is accomplished through the incorporation of bear ing surfaces within the gimbal. Common types of gimbals are ring type, as shown in Fig. 9-45, cross type, as shown in Fig. 9-46, and spherical type, as shown in Fig. 9-47.

Design of Gimbal Mounts

The following primary design considerations affect gimbal mounts:

1) Angulation. Pivotal movement will be re quired of engine assembly or thrust chamber for thrust-vector control, generally ranging from t4 to
+12 deg.
2) Thrust alignment. Design features must en able lateral offset at the gimbal-engine interface for thrust-vector alignment with respect to the engine centerline. Adjustment capability normally ranges from 5 0.10 to 5 0.4 in.

3) Loads. As derived from engine thrust re quirements and engine configuration, side loads and moments must be transmitted through the gimbal to the vehicle.

4 )  Operation life. Generally 1000 complete cy cles will be made at maximum angle, i.e., total of 40 deg excursion for a 10-deg gimbal angle. Reusable engines have higher cycle requirements.

5) Bearing surfaces. The designs must have minimum deflection of bearing surfaces and ade quate bearing area to prevent bearing-surface dam age.

6) Propellant-duct installation. Some gimbal designs require a propellant duct to pass through the gimbal.

Fig. 9-46 Typical cross-type gimbal mount de signed for medium-thrust engine.

Fig. 9-47 Spherical-type gimbal bearing assem bly.

7 )  Maintenance of the gimbal. Some gimbals require reapplication of a lubricant to the bearing surfaces; others have antifriction bearings or bearing inserts that are maintenance-free. Gimbal boots may be required to protect the bearing surfaces from dust, water, and foreign materials.

8) Weight. High-strength-to-weight materials help lessen the weight impact on the vehicle.

Ring-type gimbal mount. The ring-type gim bal shown in Fig. 9-45 was designed for a low-thrust, upper-stage engine. The design has a closed-yoke, flow-through, ring-type gimbal with plain-bearing pivot joints. This configuration allows the main oxi dizer duct to pass through the assembly in the longi tudinal axis to the thrust-chamber dome. The gimbal mount was designed to connect the vehicle on one interface and the engine thrust-chamber dome on



342 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES the other interface. The lower support of the gimbal mount provides an adjustment mechanism for thrust vector alignment. Except for the steel pivot pins and the alignment bolts, all other parts can be made of either aluminum or titanium alloys for minimum weight. The bearing surfaces of the pivot pins should be chromium or electroless-nickel-plated. Solid, dry film lubricant or grease coatings are applied to all bearing surfaces. The design bearing pressure of this gimbal type runs about 10,000 psi of bearing pro jected area. The bearing coefficient of friction is about 0.08.

Cross-type gimbal mount. Figure 9-46 shows the design of a typical cross-type gimbal mount used on medium-thrust engines (up to 200,000 lb). Here, the gimbal mount secures the engine assembly to the vehicle thrust frame and is mounted to the thrust chamber dome and elbow assembly. It consists of a cross-shaped unit incorporating bearing surfaces, up per and lower gimbal-bearing blocks, upper and lower retainers, and thrust-vector-aligning slides. All parts of this design are made of 4340 alloy steel. The bearing surfaces of the cross unit are chromium or electroless-nickel-plated. The bearing surfaces of the blocks and retainers are phosphate-treated. Solid film dry-lubricant coatings are applied to all bearing surfaces, with grease providing supplemental lubrica tion. The design bearing pressure of this type gimbal mount ranges from 15,000 to 27,000 psi of bearing projected area. The bearing coefficient of friction varies between 0.06 and 0.10.

Spherical-type gimbal mount. Figure %47
shows a spherical gimbal mount designed for the SSME; and similar designs have been used on en gines with thrust up to 1,500,000 lb. The gimbal is bolted to the vehicle on one side and to the engine powerhead on the other. The unit consists of a lower body with a spherical protrusion and an upper seat with a spherical socket. A center block and shaft transmit side and torsional loads. Spherical bearing surfaces receive the engine-thrust load. All parts are made of 6 AL-6V-25n titanium heat-treated to provide an ultimate strength of 175,000 psi. A Teflon-fiber glass-composite insert bonded to the spherical socket provides a low-friction bearing surface. The shaft and block bearing surfaces are coated with a dry-film lubricant. With the bearing insert and dry-film lubri cant, the gimbal does not require additional lubrica tion. The design bearing pressure for the bearing in sert extends to 28,000 lb/in. 2 and for the dry-film lu bricant, to 20,000 lb/in. 2 of bearing projected area. The coefficient of friction varies between 0.06 and
0.10 for the dry-film-lubricant coating and between
0.02 and 0.10 for the Teflon-fiberglass insert at 75"F. The coefficient of friction increases to 0.20 at -100"F and lower temperatures. Friction at low temperature can be a concern if the gimbal is mounted on a component  carrying a cryogenic propellant that produces a temperature soak-back condition or if op eration occurs in a cold space environment.

The lateral adjustment for thrust alignment can be done by eccentric bushings with the required off set machined into the bushings based on engine hot fire data. In another common adjustment, this type of gimbal will be given a tongue-and-groove ar rangement between the lower gimbal body and the thrust-chamber dome.

Chapter 10

Engine Systems Design Integration

10.1 SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

The foregoing chapters have covered design of the major liquid-propellant rocket engine subsystems and their components. These subsystems fulfill a use ful purpose only when integrated into a whole where they function as a system and generate the designed thrust. Although viewing the complete rocket engine as the system, the designer should not lose sight of the fact that, to the stage builder, the engine is again a subsystem. In fact, to the launch-vehicle systems engineer, the stage in turn becomes a subsystem, in addition to other stages, ground-support equipment, launch facilities, downrange stations, etc.

An earlier chapter defined the major engine pa rameters requiring optimization during rocket-engine design. Clearly the subsystems discussed will not form an optimized complete system unless they are designed for one another with this goal in mind from the beginning. The subsystems presented in the fore going chapters have become highly specialized fields during recent years. Their designers and developers often have only a rather general feeling for the func tions and peculiarities of the other subsystems. Their concentrated effort will not come about unless guid ed by an important function: systems engineering.

In most rocket-engine projects this function is as signed to the "systems engineer," commonly called the "project engineer" or "project manager." In con formance with user requirements, the systems engi neer has the job of establishing all ground rules and performance parameters (see Chapter 2). He/she subsequently optimizes them through complete integration of all subsystems during the entire design and development period.

Because of the interaction of funding, time, and reliability (previously discussed), the project engi neer must be a good manager, in addition to having engineering qualifications. The project engineer needs to have adequate authority, commensurate with his or her responsibilities, from superiors. The project engineer must have a broad and thorough understanding of the various disciplines governing the design and development of the subsystems. In view of the latter's high specialization, the project engineer cannot be expected to have a complete education in all these disciplines. However, in the words of Du Pont's Crawford H. Greenewalt, the project engineer must have "the ability to create a harmonious whole out of what the academic world calls dissimilar disciplines," and that in this respect this job may be compared to that of a "symphony conductor under whose hand a hundred or so highly specialized and very different talents become a single effort of great effectiveness."

The job of systems integration does not merely ensure that all parts physically fit together, although this certainly is a basic requirement. Wherever parts

345

and subsystems join, an interface exists, i.e., a demar cation line between these systems. This interface may be a bolt-hole pattern; a flow of fluid, heat, or electri cal current; an exchange of forces, loads, or torques;
or a complex dynamic interaction.

The word "aerospace" has become synonymous with systems engineering. Over the years it has been increasingly stressed. Figure 10-1 shows the final con figuration of an F-1 engine, used in the Apollo Pro gram. Comparing this to Fig. 2-4 will reveal the progress made through good systems engineering. However, to have designed and developed a good looking, perfectly-functioning rocket engine is not enough.

It may seem superfluous to state that the design of a rocket engine must also consider the vehicle ap plication. Yet, in problem solving, and in engine de tail design and development, this application is eas ily forgotten. The rocket engine/component designer and developer who can think and converse in terms of vehicle application will be sought after indeed, as will the company represented by that designer.

Rocket-engine design for a particular vehicle ap plication is a consideration not only for vehicle flight or for optimum mission performance but also for the many details of integration into the flight ve hicle. After the engine has been designed and de veloped, and long before the first flight, it must be installed. The facets of engine installation in a vehi cle range from the more complex areas, such as guidance-loop compliance and prestart conditioning, to simple "nuts and bolts" problems, such as match ing, connecting, fitting dimensions, and attachment bolt sizes.

346 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

We can easily realize the importance of continu ous and close communication between the engine design team and the vehicle design team. Complete and free exchange of correspondence,  documenta tion and progress reports, frequent design reviews, and, above all, prompt notification of changes are vi tal. A close simulation of the flight-vehicle configura tion when  performing static engine-development tests will materially reduce the possibility of later
"surprises." Each vehicle type, according to its mis sion, will have somewhat different interface prob lems. Many of these problems occur, however, in al most any vehicle type.

10.2 ENGINE SYSTEM DYNAMIC ANALYSIS

System dynamic analysis looks at the behavior of the engine system as it changes with t imewas opposed to the steady state of constant operation with t imeN such operations as start, shutdown, throttling, and pulsing. In addition, stability and control are examined and evaluated not only internal to the engine system but also be tween  the engine and vehicle.

This dynamic analysis helps characterize the operation of the system. It thus provides a means for evaluating the feasibility of a given engine configura tion, predicting its operational performance, trou bleshoot ing as development  problems arise, ex amining alternate operating approaches,  and opti mizing various aspects of operation and control.

In pump-fed propulsion systems an opt imum sequence of controls is critical to a safe and reliable start, throttle, and shutdown operation. The optimi zation must consider but not be limited to com ponent  performance tolerances, e.g. high tempera ture excursions in a main combustion chamber or tubine inlet(s), or pressure surges in feed lines. Attention must also be given to operat ing the respective propellant pumps within a certain range relating to head (pump delta-P/density), speed, and flowrate.

Technical  Approach

The basic analytical approach uses mathematical models to simulate the many aspects of engine-sys tem operation. In the case of start, shutdown, and throttling, the models are nonlinear, with lumped and distributed parameters, and are composed of al gebraic and integral-differential equations. The equa tions are programmed for digital-computer solution and give a time history of the appropriate parame ters. The computer model becomes, in effect, an en gine simulation which can be varied to evaluate dif ferent operating concepts.

Another type of system dynamic problem con cerns the interaction of the propellant-feed system and the combustion process. It too will be analyzed with mathematical models. However, these models utilize linear system techniques, such as frequency-re sponse analysis. The approach is often one of find ing the appropriate resistance in the injector to damp the oscillating behavior that results from this interaction.

Circum ferential modes are handled by the use of baffles that protrude perpendicularly from the injector face and run radially from the face center to the outside edge of the injector.

The interaction between the feed-system dynam ics and vehicle structure (POGO) sometimes occurs in large rocket systems and is moderated by the use of an accumulator to detune the feed system. Here again, mathematical modeling is the analytical tool.

Modeling. A computer  model consists of structured equations and incorporated chemical and physical data. It blends these elements with program logic. The logic framework can be represented by a diagram, as shown in Fig. 10-2. The model typcially consists of input, computation, and data-storage and output sections. The logic directs the data input, the computation process, and the generation and display of output data.

Examples  of  Equations, Functions, and Tables for a Mathematical Engine Model

The mathematical expressions and equations for the various physical processes and operating dynamics of a rocket engine may be derived from equations given in Chapter 1 and in other chapters for the de sign of the various components. In this chapter, sev eral typical examples will be presented to illustrate the application of these equations in a mathematical model.

2. Combustion process; operating dynamics..

Figure 10-3 describes schematically the combust ion process. A transportation delay, represent ing the time required for the propellants to pass through the injector and enter into the combustion process, can be expressed as follows:

1:o = Po Ao (Lo + L~)/Wo (10-4)

~f = pf Af (Lf + L~)/x~f (10-5)

For f requency-domain analysis, these can be indi cated by the Laplace-transformation operators e -tos and e -tfs. A homogeneous  combustion gas allows defining the following correlations:

Pc = R' (Tc/M) (wc/Vc) (10-6)

348 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES curvgs developed by the component-design groups rather than to use equations. For example, the rela tionships between pump delta-P, speed, flow, and torque are depicted in Fig. 10-4, along with the char acteristic turbine curves.

To define combustion-gas properties for a given propellant combination, the characteristic velocity C*, combustion temperature Tc, molecular weight M, and ratio of specific heats ~, can be plotted as a func tion of oxidizer fraction, as shown in Fig. 10-5. Curves can be input as a series of points, and inter polation can be used to obtain appropriate values.

Propellant properties can be obtained from ref erence tables and interpolated as a function of two variables. Pressure is often determined as a function of internal energy and density as depicted in the fol lowing example:

Dynamic Analysis of Engine-System Start and Shutdown Transients

The main objectives of fluid-dynamic analysis of en gine-system start transients may be summarized as follows:

 Investigation of the system's design for needed start-transient controls, such as type and quantity of control components, and sequencing and timing of their operation.

 Estimation of start energy, time, and thrust buildup characteristics.

 Evaluation of component  dynamic character istics and interactions during start transients, such as propellant-pump stalling, combustion-chamber igni tion delays, and mixture-ratio excursions within combustion devices.

 Evaluation of system dynamic stability during the start transient. The aim is to avoid prolonged operation at levels exhibiting system or thrust-cham ber oscillations.

 Evaluation of various potential perturbations and their effects on start transients, such as a start lacking the propellant-settling effects of gravitation.

For some engine systems, such as the LO2/LH2
turbopump-feed system of the A-2 Stage engine, dy namic analyses of its start transient become rather complex.  They may include effects such as waterhammer (wave equation) in the propellant-feed systems, distributed heat transfer and pressure drops throughout the high-pressure fuel-feed system, the choking of hydrogen gas in the chamber coolant passages, stall characteristics of the fuel pump, cavitation at the pump inlets, changes in fuel density in the pump caused by enthalpy changes from pumping, and many others.

Figure 10-6 presents graphically a modeled start transient of a typical turbopump-fed engine system utilizing a gas generator for turbine drive. It indicates valve timing, as well as pressure-buildup characteris tics of the gas generator, propellant pumps, and main chamber. Other parameters, such as gas-generator combus t ion  gas t empera tu re  and prope l lan t flowrates, can be included in the graph. The model typically will be used to simulate several engine-start methods to evaluate potential problem areas and to optimize the system's transient operation.

Dynamic analysis of engine-shutdown transients focus on the following important objectives:

 Investigation of the system's design for needed shutdown-transient controls, including operational sequencing and timing of various control valves.

 Evaluating engine thrust-decay characteristics. A series of shutdown sequences with modified shutoff timing of the control valves will usually be simulated with the mathematical model. The various simulated shutdown runs will be analyzed to deter mine potential problem areas and to investigate whether or not these problems are a function of the particular sequence used.

Figure 10-7 presents graphically the shutdown transient model of the typical engine depicted in Fig.
10-6. The engine thrust-decay characteristics are rep resented by the main-chamber-pressure decay curve. The integrated area under the chamber-pressure-vs. time curve may be used to assess the engine-shut down impulse.

Dynamic Analysis of  Engine-Vehicle Interactions

Engine-vehicle interaction analyses may be per formed during the initial design phase of an engine system, as well as following developmental test firings. Areas of general interest to be analyzed may include, but should not be limited to, the following:

 Engine system operation and performance re quirements from a vehicle-mission point of view.

 Matching of engine propellant-supply require ments with the vehicle propellant system, including dynamic evaluation of the vehicle-propellant-tank pressurization system, propellant-utilization (PU)
control system, vehicle acceleration and sloshing ef fects, and feed-system combustion-coupled instabili ties.

 Matching the engine controls with the vehicle guidance system, including response of engine start, shutdown, thrust level, and vector controls to vehicle guidance commands.

 Simulation of the interaction between engine system operation and vehicle dynamics. (This may involve closed-loop coupling of a simulation of vehi cle guidance and trajectory characteristics with an engine system during hot-firing.)

 Simulation of the interaction between engine feed-system and vehicle structural dynamics.

Section 10.7 under the heading "Dynamic Inter actions" describes the problem of and a decoupling approach to engine-vehicle interactions.

Low-Frequency Combustion Instability

Analysis of low-frequency combustion stability treats the interaction of the propellant system (pump inlet to combustion-chamber injector) and the combus tion process. The term "low frequency," in this case, refers to the range of 50 to 1000 Hz. Linear-system analytical tools are used, i.e., linear differential equa tions to model the system and to define transfer functions and a frequency-response technique to de fine stability. Component characteristics accounted for in the analysis include the following:

 Resistance of the pump, propellant valve, and orifice.

 Dynamics of the feed line downstream of the pump.



350 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

 Resistance of the injector with the inertia and compliance of the injector manifold.

 Combustion chamber as an acoustic tube ter minated by a sonic throat.

 Gas generated by combustion. The liquid/gas conversion is ideally described by a linear differential equation that can be expressed as a f requency-dependent  transfer function. Combus tion delays and clumping, as well as a distributed burning zone, form part of the modeling.

In a low-pressure combustion chamber  under steady flow, propellant droplets atomize and vaporize as they move downstream from the injector, while chemically reacting. Atomization is essentially a mechanical process while vaporization results from the feedback of a portion of the heat from the chem ical reaction. In a high-pressure system, true atomiza tion and vaporization may not be possible, but there is still mixing and energy feedback in preparation for the chemical reaction. Either case will see a change in propellant density distributed along the chamber length. The fraction of propellant  burned as a function of axial distance can be calculated.

For low-frequency combustion, the combustion and feed systems can be considered to be composed of a number of sections, as shown in Fig. 10-8. Each of the blocks has a si..qle input and output. The dashed line represents ~ :dgnal path, which is actually closed. For this case, however, the stability of the sys tem can more readily be studied by using the open loop approach.

The thrust chamber is assumed to have an oscil latory gas flow as an input. The resulting injection end chamber pressure variation drives flow through the iniector. The flow variation is attenuated some what by the impedance of the feed system.

The f requency response  of the combust ion chamber, feed system, and injector are combined and evaluated over the frequency range of interest to generate a stability plot (Nyquist). An example in Fig. 10-9 shows the stability characteristic as a system is throttled down through the 70% power level (PL)
and through the 60% PL. Note that at 70% PL the sys tem is stable in that the response curve does not en close the +1 point on the real axis. At 60% PL the system has become unstable.

10.3 DESIGN INTEGRATION FOR ENGINE SYSTEM CALIBRATION

Calibration Design Requirements

Because of unavoidable mechanical tolerances, it may be expected that the operating characteristics and performance of the various engine-system com ponents will deviate somewhat from the nominal de sign value. A certain amount of calibration will always be required for these components, as well as the en gine system as a whole, to attain the desired engine performance characteristics within design specifica tion. Provisions must be made in component  and systems design to permit effective calibration during system integration.

The specific impulse I s of an engine system being the ratio of r.hrust F to propellant weight flowrate ~ , any deviations affecting F or v~, will affect system per formance. Is is also being a function of propellant mixture ratio; therefore it might be desirable and beneficial to calibrate an engine system by adjusting its propellant-feed system. Before a complete engine system calibration, the pressure or pressure-drop-vs. flow characteristics of each individual component should be calibrated and evaluated.

Hydraulic and pneumatic components,  such as pressure and flow regulators, valves, flowmeters, ducts, and lines, can all be readily calibrated on flow benches. However, components that operate at tern

10-11 Propellant-flow design characteristics of  the A-1 Stage turbopump-fed engine system. perature extremes, such as thrust-chamber assem blies, gas generators, and turbopumps, will best be calibrated by combining the flow tests with actual hot firings. The characteristic propellant-flow curve of an engine system will be obtained by summing the pres sure or pressure-drop-vs.-flow curves of the various components (Fig. 10-10 and 10-11).

The general design approaches in calibrating an engine system (to attain its design thrust at design mixture ratio) are the following:

,, The design operating point of each compo nent should be kept within the relatively fiat region of its pressure or pressure drop versus flow curve.

 The mechanical tolerances and built-in ad justments of each component should be designed so that the random deviation of its flow characteristics from its design value will be kept within a reasonable limit, in order to facilitate systems calibration, and to keep other system components in their design oper ating region.

 Sufficient pressure head should be set aside in each engine propellant feed system to compensate for contingencies caused by component flow resis tance deviations. The propellant feed system can then be calibrated by means of orifices or other ad justing means.

Design for Calibration of  a Pressure-Feed Sys tem

The first design step determines the design flowrate of each propellant, as calculated from the system's thrust, design mixture ratio, and Is (as verified by ac tual thrust-chamber test firings). Based on these



352 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES flowrates, the pressure drops of the various compo nents at the design operating point can be estimated from previous design data or as obtained from actual testing. Certain components  may have to be de signed for the specific design pressure drops allowed by the system.

The design-pressure-vs.-flow curve of either pro pellant flow system can be obtained by summation of design-chamber-pressure-vs.-flow and component de sign-pressure-drop characteristics, as shown in Fig.
10-10. In addition, a calibration orifice will be intro duced into each propellant-flow system. These steps will yield the minimum required tank-pressure-vs. flow curve for each propellant. In most pressure-feed systems, design orifice pressure drop for system cali bration determines the maximum allowable cumula tive-pressure-drop increase of the components above nominal values. A suitable tank-pressurization system can then be designed, compatible with minimum re quired tank-pressure-vs.-flow characteristics.

Sample  Calculat ion 10-I

The following data from analyses and component tests characterize the A-4 Stage propulsion system at rated-thrust conditions:

 Thrust-chamber-injector end pressure range required to maintain rated thrust = 110 + 3
psia.

 Thrust-chamber-injector pressure drop range
(both oxidizer and fuel) = 25 + 2 psi.

 Thrust-chamber oxidizer-dome pressure drop=
3 + 1 psi.

 Oxidizer-line pressure drop = 5 + 1 psi.
 Main-oxidizer-valve pressure drop (at the fully open position) = 4 +_ 1 psi.
 Thrust-chamber fuel-manifold pressure drop=

4 _+ 1 psi.
 Fuel-line pressure drop = 4 + 1 psi.
,, Main-fuel-valve pressure drop (at the fully open position) --- 4 _+ 1 psi.
 Pressure allowance required for mixture-ratio control by oxidizer-valve vernier positioning
=_+ 10 psi.

P r o b l e m

Determine the design pressure drops of the calibra tion orifices and the minimum required tank pres sures for design flowrates.

S o l u t i o n  10-1

The design pressure drop of a calibration orifice must equal the sum of the maximum pressure-drop increases of components above design values. Thus:

 The design pressure drop of the oxidizer-cali bration orifice = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 psi.

 The minimum required oxidizer-tank pressure at the design flowrate = 110 + 25 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 8 + 10
- 165 psia.

 The design pressure drop of fuel-calibration o r i f i c e = 3 + 2 +  1 + 1 + 1 = 8 p s i .

 Minimum required fuel-tank pressure at the design flowrate = 110 + 25 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 155 psia.

This particular example, a worst case, assumed that all components had maximum pressure drop. It is more likely that the square root of the sum of squares would be used. In the case of the oxidizer ori fice, for example, that would give about 4 instead of 8
psi for the calibration orifice. Also, it should be noted that in the early stages of a system design, most of the pressure-drop numbers represent esti mates that will continually be revised as a system is developed.

D e s i g n  for  Cal ibrat ion o f  a T u r b o p u m p - F e d S y s t e m

The propellant-flow characteristics downstream of the pump discharge of a turbopump-fed system are similar to those of a pressure-feed system. However, the difference in turbopump pressure or head-vs.-flow characteristics from those of a pressurized system dictates a somewhat different approach to system cal ibration. For mechanically coupled turbopump-fed systems, such as the A-1 Stage engine, system calibra tion typically involves adjustment of the turbopump speed, as well as installation of an orifice in one of the propellant lines. For turbopump-fed systems with dual turbine drive, such as the A-2 Stage engine, the calibration can be made by adjusting the speeds of both turbopumps.

The design principles for calibration of mechan ically-coupled turbopump-fed engine systems will best be illustrated by a typical example, as shown in Fig. 10-11. Here, the propellant-system resistance curves without orifices (representing conditions downstream of the pump discharges) are constructed based on the designs and test results of the compo nents for the A-1 Stage engine system. Next, the dis charge pressure-vs.-flow curves of both pumps are constructed from test data obtained with the A-1
Stage engine turbopump, operated at speed N1. These pump curves intersect the corresponding system re sistance curves at point A. At this speed, fuel flowrate Wfa exceeds, and oxidizer flowrate Woa falls below, the required design flowrates, @fd and Wod. To achieve the design oxidizer-pump flow Wod at a desired discharge pressure Pod, the design operating speed of the turbopump assembly must be raised to a required level N2 by increasing the turbine gas flow. At this speed, however, the fuel pump, which is mounted on the same shaft as the oxidizer pump, would be delivering a flowrate Wfb considerably above the required design flowrate Wfd (point B in Fig. 10-11). To reduce the fuel flow to Wfd, a calibration orifice is placed in the fuel line. This amounts to increasing the fuel-pump discharge pressure at constant speed N 2 to Pfc, where Wfd is reached at point C. The pressure drop across the calibrating orifice is represented by Pfc-Pfd where Pfd is the desired fuel pressure.

If fuel flowrate Wfa comes below and oxidizer flowrate Woa exceeds the required design flowrates, the calibrating process would effect a speedup the turbopump to obtain the desired fuel flow, and lead to placement of an orifice in the oxidizer line. However, it will usually be desirable to place the ori

rice in the system of the propellant with the higher boiling point. In this situation, therefore, and also w h e n  the pressure drop across a calibrating orifice tends to become excessive, it is customary to trim the p u m p  impeller to reduce the effective speed and thus attain the required flow and pressure levels. In view of pump-efficiency effects, it is desirable to trim the p u m p  drawing the smaller horsepower,  usually the one with the lower mass flowrate, except in cases of extreme density differences. The adjustment of the turbine-gas flowrate, and thus the turbopump operat ing speed, can also be made by means of orifices in the turbine-inlet gas line or in the gas-generator pro pellant lines.

In general, turbopump-fed systems permit less stringent requirements for the various components regarding deviations from their design steady-state flow values, because the system is inherently more flexible. However,  systems dynamic characteristics under  transient conditions may restrict these devia tions.

Sample Calculation 10-2

The following design values and allowable deviations characterize the A-1 Stage LOX/RP-1 engine-system components  at rated thrust:

 Thrust-chamber injector end pressure = 1095 +
30 psia.

 Thrust-chamber injector pressure drop (both oxidizer and fuel) = 200 + 20 psi.

 Thrust-chamber oxidizer-dome pressure drop=
150 + 10 psi.

 Oxidizer-line pressure drop = 25 + 2 psi.
 Main-oxidizer-valve pressure drop - 35 + 3 psi.
 Oxidizer-pump specific speed NS = 1980 rpm.
 Oxidizer-pump suction (min) = 55 psia.
 Oxidizer-pump discharge pressure at 7000 rpm and a design flowrate of 1971 lb/s = 1505 + 25 psia.
 Thrust-chamber fuel jacket and manifold pres sure drop = 290 + 20 psi.
 Fuel-line pressure drop, 10 + 2 psi.
 Main-fuel-valve pressure drop, 15 + 2 psi.
 Fuel-pump specific speed NS, 1090 rpm.
 Fuel-pump suction pressure, 45 psia min.
 Fuel-pump discharge pressure at 7000 rpm and a design flowrate of 892 lb/s = 1720 + 25 psi.

P r o b l e m

Determine the location of the calibration orifice, its nominal  design pressure drop, and its expected range of adjustment.

S o l u t i o n  1 0 - 2  [ S e e  Sample Calculation 6-2]

 Required oxidizer pressure head at the design point = 1095 + 200 + 150 + 25 + 35 = 1505 psia.

 Required fuel pressure head at the design point = 1095 + 200 + 270 + 10 + 15 = 1590 psia.

Since the LOX-pump discharge pressure is 1505
psia, but the fuel-pump discharge pressure is 1720
psia, the calibration orifice must be located in the fuel system. The nominal orifice design pressure drop will be 1720-1590 = 110 psi.

Because of the effects of chamber-pressure devia tions, the maximum value of fuel-calibration-orifice pressure drop will be required when the following conditions exist:

(a) Thrust-chamber- injector  end pressure at its lower limit (1065 psia).

(b) All pressure drops in oxidizer passages at their higher limits.

(c) All pressure drops in fuel passages at their lower limits.

(d)  Oxidizer-pump discharge pressure, 25 psi below its nominal  value at the tu rbopump speed commensurate with the stated specific speed.

(e) Fuel-pump discharge pressure, 25 psi above its nominal value at the same speed.

The equivalent required oxidizer pump discharge pressure under  these conditions:

1065+220 1 6 0 + 2 7 + 3 8 + 2 5 = 1 5 3 5 p s i a .

Required oxidizer-pump-developed head H:

144 x (1535 - 55)/71.38 = 2986 ft

Oxidizer-pump volumetric flowrate Q:

1971 x 449/71.38 = 12,400 gpm

Substitute this into Eq. (6-7) to obtain the re quired pump speed, as follows:

= Ns H0.75/Q0.5
= 1980 x (2,986)0.75/(12,400) 0.5 = 7182 rpm

Fuel-pump volumetric flow Q:

892 x 449/50.45 = 7939 gpm

From Eq. (6-7), fuel-pump nominal developed head at 7190 rpm H -- (NQ0.5/Ns)1.333 = (7182 x (7939)0.5/
1090)1-333 = 4905 ft or 4905 x 50.45/144 = 1718 psi.

The equivalent fuel-pump discharge pressure at these conditions would be 1718 + 45 + 25 = 1785 psia.

The required pressure drop for the fuel line cali bration orifice thus would be 1788-1065-180-250-8-13
= 232 psi.

Similarly, a min imum fuel-cal ibrat ion-orif ice pressure drop must be achieved when the following conditions exist:

 Thrust-chamber-injector end pressure is at its higher limit (1125 psia).

 Conditions (b), (c), (d), and (e) above are re versed.

The equivalent required oxidizer-pump discharge pressure under these conditions = 1125 + 180 + 140 +
23 + 32 - 25 = 1475 psia. Required oxidizer-pump de veloped head H = 144 (1475 - 55)/71.38 = 2865 ft.



354 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Substituting this into Eq. (6-7), the required pump speed will be  N = 1980 x (2865)0.75/(12,400)0.5 = 6963 rpm

From Eq. (6-7), the fuel-pump nominal developed head will be H = [(6963) (7950)0.5/109011.333
= 4707 ft or 4707 x 50.45/144 = 1649 psi

The equivalent fuel-pump discharge pressure at these conditions would be 1649 + 45 - 25 --- 1669 psia.

The required pressure drop of the fuel-line cali bration orifice under these conditions would be 1669
- 1 1 2 5 - 2 2 0 - 2 9 0 - 1 2 - 1 7 = 5 p s i .

Therefore the required range of adjustment for the pressure drop of the fuel-line calibration orifice runs from 5 to 232 psi.

The preceding discussion pertains to fixed-thrust rocket engines. Engine systems that throttle under computer control automatically adjust mixture ratio.

10.4 ENGINE-SYSTEM INTEGRATED PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Engine-system design must integrate performance characteristics. These data are prepared and com piled by the rocket-engine designer to provide the vehicle systems engineer with information necessary to integrate the propulsion system with the vehicle system. Where possible, a brief explanation of the data and its application should be included to pro vide clearer understanding and greater usefulness. The following data represent important aspects of in tegrated engine performance.

N o m i n a l  Engine-Performance  Values at Rated Condi t ions

Usually prescribed by the engine-model specifica tion, these data describe nominal steady-state opera tion of the engine system at rated conditions. Tables
3-2 to 3-5 give typical examples of nominal engine operating and performance parameters, which in clude nominal thrust, specific impulse, propellant combination, flowrates, mixture ratio, and various component operating data. Allowable deviations are specified for important parameters such as thrust
(+3%) and mixture ratio (+2%). Engine-system spe cific impulse will usually be specified at its minimum value. The performance of all deliverable engine sys tems must exceed this minimum during acceptance tests.

In addition to tables for nominal engine-perfor mance parameters, nominal engine performance graphs, such as chamber pressure vs. engine thrust and engine specific impulse vs. engine thrust, are of ten included as additional monitoring aids. Figure 10 12 presents a typical performance graph for the A-1
Stage engine system: chamber pressure vs. engine thrust at sea level.

into Eq. (1-28):

~v = F/Is = 750,000/270 = 2778 Ib/s

The thrus t -chamber  mixture ratio can n o w  be used to a p p r o x i m a t e  the c o r r e s p o n d i n g  ox id ize r  and  fuel flowrates. x~ o = 2778 x 2.35/(2.35 + 1) - 1948 lb/s

Oxidizer  flowrate = 1948 + 3 - 1951 lb/s

Engine-fuel flowrate v~' f  = 2778 - 1948 = 830 lb/s

From Eq. (6-12) and  (6-13) can be  de t e rmined the r equ i r ed  oxidizer-  and  f u e l - p u m p  drive ho r se p o w e r  for this approximat ion:

 Ox id i ze r -pump  h o r s e p o w e r  = (1951 x 2930)/
(550 x 0.707) = 14,700 hp.

 Fue l -pump horse  p o w e r  = (830 x 4790)/(550 x
0.659) = 10,970 hp.

 The c o r r e s p o n d i n g  tu rb ine  shaft  h o r s e p o w e r Thp = 14,700 + 10,970 + 500 = 26,170 hp.

From Eq. (6-19), the c o r r e s p o n d i n g  turbine-gas flowrate:

wt = (550/778) x 26,170/(359 x 0.582) = 88.6 lb/s

This value can be used  to start a n e w  calculation cy cle to s epa ra t e  m a i n - c h a m b e r  and  g a s - g e n e r a t o r data .  Thrus t  g e n e r a t e d  by a t u r b i n e - e x h a u s t - g a s flowrate of 88.6 lb/s = 88.6 x 32.6 = 2887 lb.

 Thus, the ma in - chamber  thrust  Ft = 750,000  2887 = 747,113 lb.

 Thrus t - chamber  f lowrate  Wtc = 747,113/270 =
2767 lb/s.

 Oxid ize r -pump flowrate = (88.6 x 0.408)/(1 +
0.408) + (2767 x 2.35)/(1 + 2.35) + 3 = 25.7 + 1941 +
3 = 1969.7 lb/s.

 Fuel -pump flowrate = (88.6o25.7)+(2767-1941) =
888.9 lb/s.

 Turbine-shaft  ho r sepower  Thp = (1969.7x2930)/
(550 x 0.707) + (888.9 x 4790)/(550 x 0.659) + 500 =
27,090 hp.

 Turbine gas flowrate wt = [(550/778) x 27,090]/
(359 x 0.582) = 91.7 lb/s.

This value will serve another  calculation trial:
 Thrust  g e n e r a t e d  by  a t u r b i n e - e x h a u s t  gas flowrate of 91.7 lb/s = 91.7 x 32.6 = 2989 lb.
 M a i n - c h a m b e r  thrust  Ft = 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 -  2986 =

747,014 lb.
 Thrus t - chamber  f lowrate Wtc = 747,011/270 =

2767 lb/s.
 O x i d i z e r - p u m p  f lowrate  = 91.7 x 0.408/(1 +

0.408) + (2767 x 2.35)/(1 + 2.35 ) + 3 = 1970.6 lb/s.
 Fue l -pump flowrate = (91.7 - 26.6) + (2767
1941) = 891.1 lb/s.
 Turbine shaft ho r sepower  Thp = 1970.6 x 2930/

(550 x 0.707) + (891.1 x 4790)/(550 x 0.659) + 500 =
14,849 + 11,776 + 500 = 27,125 hp.

 Turbine-gas  f lowrate 4 t = (550/778) x 27,125/
(359 x 0.582) = 91.8 lb/s.

This last value closely confirms the assumpt ions for the last trial. Thus:

(a) Nominal  turbine-exhaust -gas  thrust = 91.8 x
32.6 = 2993 lb.

(b)  N o m i n a l  m a i n - t h r u s t - c h a m b e r  th rus t  - 750,000- 2993 - 747,000 lb.

Because the influence coefficients are linear, the total of several influences acting s imultaneously on an engine system can be determined by summing the individual effects. For example,  the change of engine thrust for the A-1 Stage engine  system (without  C*

When the linear approximation is not sufficiently ac curate, the usefulness of the engine influence coeffi cients can be ex tended  by a technique that allows nonl inear  corrections for certain parameters.  An ex ample of this me thod  is the C* correction. For in stance, a plot the change of C* correction vs. engine mixture ratio may be used in conjunction with a table of influence coefficients, such as Fig. 10-13 and Table
10-1, which are for the A-1 engine system. The change of engine mixture ratio can be computed  for changes in atmospheric pressure, propellant densities, etc., as o

Estimate the thrust of the A-1 Stage engine system operated at the conditions listed for sample calcula tion (10-4), adding the effects of C* correction. Also, for the same conditions, estimate the thrust, assuming an additional mixture-ratio error of +10% caused by faulty calibration.

Solution 10-5

By analogy with Eq. (10-14) and using Table 10-1, the engine system's mixture ratio change caused by the conditions of Sample Calculation 10-4 will be as fol lows:

(MR - MRn)/MRn = 1.642 x (71 - 71.38)/71.38 +

(-1.365) x (50.9 - 50.45)/50.45 + 0.027 x (65 - 55)/55 +

(-0.002) x (49-45)/45 = -0.0162 or-1.62%

From Fig. 10-13, the C* correction for a mixture ratio change o f - 1 . 6 2 %  is approximate ly-0 .02%. From Table 10-1, the influence coefficient for engine-sys tem thrust is 1.1030 for a 1% C* correction. Thus % change in F = 4.527 + (-0.02) x 1.103 = 4.505%

Therefore, engine-system thrust considering effects of C* correction will bern

F - 750,000 x (1 + 0.04505) = 783,790 lb

Adding the mixture ratio error of 10%, the total mix ture ratio change -- 10 - 1.62 = 8.38%. From Fig. 10-13, the C* correction will then be approximately-0.11%. Thus:

% change in F - 4.527 + (-0.11) x 1.103 = 4.406%

Engine system thrust F = 750,000 x (1 + 0.04406)
= 783,050 lb

10.5 MECHANICAL INTEGRATION OF ENGINE SYSTEMS

Basic Considerations

Besides combining all components and subsystems functionally and physically, the design for mechani cal integration of an engine system must consider the overall envelope of the system and its weight. This includes the location of the system's center of gravity. Also, it should permit simplified maintenance and checkout practices. Judicious packaging design should be applied to minimize the number of interconnect ing hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical lines, with their attendant fittings, connectors, joints, and other potential trouble spots. Welded and brazed joints should be used as much as possible. Problems intro duced by vibration, high temperatures and pressures, and leakage and space restrictions will thus be more easily handled. Engine mechanical integration being a vital part of the system-design concept, all factors related to integration and packaging of components and subsystems must receive careful consideration early in the preliminary design stage.

In general, a modular packaging approach should be selected--like those used for the A-1 (Fig. 3-2) and A-2 (Fig. 3-4) Stage engine systems, as well as for many advanced operational engine systems. This en sures engine integrity from time of manufacture through vehicle launch. It also provides a compact package for ease of handling, transportation, and in stallation in the vehicle. Such packaging enables ease of checkout and component accessibility.

The engine should be completely assembled in the manufacturer's plant. Subsequent acceptance test ing, air transportation, and installation in the vehicle in the field should not require assembly of additional major components. Integrity of the propellant-feed and hot-gas systems, once verified in a complete sys tem during acceptance test, will not necessarily be nullified by the need to temporarily disassemble the engine for shipment. The integrated-engine-package concept provides added assurance that static test stand firing results have verified structural soundness of the package to a substantially greater degree than would be the case for a system in which the vehicle provides portions of the engine structure.

As an example of a special case of mechanical integration of a liquid-propellant rocket engine, the prepackaged storable-liquid-propellant propulsion system shown in Fig. 8-1 represents a completely in tegrated assembly, of all-welded construction, consist ing of thrust-chamber assemblies, propellant tanks, pressurization system, and necessary controls. This integration provides maximum assurance of system integrity from the time of manufacture, which in cludes loading of the propellants, delivery, vehicle assembly, and launch. For maximum safety, hermeti cally sealed burst-diaphragms completely separate propellants until "systems start." Acceptance tests sample units at random from the production line and hot-fire them. In addition, destructive tests of various types are performed on prepackaged storable propellant systems.

Packaging of  Rocket-engine Components

Most major rocket-engine components ,  such as thrust-chamber (Fig. 4-1) and turbopump (Fig. 6-16)
assemblies, readily form a logical, independent me chanical unit by virtue of function and physical shape. In the case of minor components,  however, such as control valves, gas generators, and igniters, packaging design principles can best be served by making them an integral part of a major component assembly or integrating them by groupingma typical example being a gas-generator assembly externally attached to a turbine-inlet flange (Fig. 3-2). Similarly, gas-generator propellant valves and the combustor can be integrated into one unit (Fig. 4-64).

Certain types of hydraulic and pneumatic rocket engine control components  lend themselves most conveniently to the packaging design, one of the main objectives with these being to reduce line runs by  combining all parts and passages into one hous ing. Such a housing (or mounting plate) can be rela tively leakproof, because trouble areas will be limited to external line connections to other components. Furthermore, if components  are packaged in this manner ,  reductions of weight  and size will be achieved through the use of common walls and through the elimination of extra mounting platforms, clamps, and fasteners. The relatively few packages re quired, as compared to the usually large number of individual components ,  greatly simplifies mainte nance of such a system. Integrated packages are about as easily removed and replaced as are the separate components  making up each package. However, packaged design will not necessarily be desirable for every control system. Each case must be carefully studied.

As a rule, one of the following methods, or a combination, can be used for packaging engine-con trol components:

Bank packaging: A group of similar fiat-sided component  assemblies are bolted together in a bank or stack, with common porting through the mating surfaces from one unit to the next.

Subplate packaging.. Two or more individually housed components  are fastened to a subplate, so that all ports of the individual component  housings lead into the subplate manifold, through their mating surfaces with the subplate, and on to the systems plumbing.

Cartridge packaging: Two or more components housed individually in cylindrical cartridges are in turn assembled in a common body with suitable manifolding to the systems plumbing.

Multiple-component packaging: Detail parts for two or more components are assembled in a normal fashion in a common housing or body.

Figure 10-14 shows a typical pneumatic-control package for a large liquid-propellant rocket engine. This package combines two pressure-regulator as semblies, two relief valves, a series of solenoid valves, filter units, and check valves. It controls the flow of helium gas to various engine components.  Engine start energizes the helium-control solenoid, allowing helium to flow through the main pressure regulator to the control system, and thence internally to the main control valves through a fail-safe check valve. Should the helium gas supply system fail, this check ensures



ENGINE SYSTEMS DESIGN INTEGRATION 359

that the various engine propellant valves remain pressurized and thus open.

Packaging of Turbopump-fed Engine Systems

In earlier high-thrust rocket propulsion systems
(some of which may still be in operational use), all major engine components were mounted into a cage shaped thrust mount that was bolted to the vehicle thrust frame by lugs. Figure 2-5 shows several typical examples. With these systems, vehicle steering was done with carbon vanes protruding into the jet (V-2
and Redstone) or by swiveling the thrust chamber
(Thor, Jupiter). In the latter case, the high-pressure feed lines between pumps and injector had to be much more flexible than to account for misalign ments and thermal expansion and contraction alone.

Most advanced liquid-propellant rocket engines are tightly packaged. All major components are at tached to the main thrust chamber, directly or by means of mounting structures, as shown in Fig. 3-2, 3 4, and 9-1. The thrust chamber serves as the principal structural member of the entire engine system. For steering, the complete engine package is gimballed from a gimbal bearing that attaches directly to the thrust-chamber dome. The other half of the bearing attaches the vehicle thrust structure. The low-pressure propellant-supply ducts must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate gimbal motions. Note that vehicle steering by gimballing a single engine or chamber will be effective only for the pitch and yaw planes. Roll control requires at least two engines. For vehi cles with a cluster of engines this poses no difficulties;
but single-engine vehicles need special roll-control devices. These may be small auxiliary nozzles, possi bly used simultaneously as vernier engines after main-engine shutdown. Turbine exhaust has been proposed for roll control.

The engine may attach to the vehicle thrust struc ture by a thrust frame or a gimbal bearing, but either must be able to transmit the full thrust forces at full gimbal deflection, yet retain an adequate reserve for normal and side loads. The bolt-hole pattern must permit adjustment for tolerance deviations. In gen eral, engine and vehicle attachment-halves must be designed for one another.

(propellant pumps, turbine, gearbox, lube pump, electric heater, and auxiliary drive), gas-generator as sembly (combustor, control valves, regulator, and turbine-inlet duct), main-oxidizer-duct assembly
(including main oxidizer valve), main-fuel-duct as sembly (including main fuel valve), turbine-exhaust duct assembly (including heat exchanger), engine start subsystem (oxidizer and fuel tanks, control valves), turbopump lube subsystem (lube-oil tank and fittings), pneumatic-control package, electrical-con trol package, and engine-thrust-frame assembly. The majority of the major component and subsystem packages go within, or at the periphery of, the engine thrust-frame assembly. The main-thrust-chamber as sembly attaches to the thrust frame through a gimbal mount.

Mechanical Protection of  Engine-system Packages

Several years may elapse between the date a liquid PrOPellant rocket engine is completed and accepted by the user and its vehicle flight. Design must there fore consider means to protect the engine-system package in transit or storage against moisture, dirt, and shock. Protections include simple closures, such as caps, plugs, and cover plates applied to valve and regulator vent holes, propellant inlets, and to other openings. Frequently, these closures contain desic cant bags and indicators that warn, through change of color, of the undesired intrusion of moisture. Certain lines, however, may require communication with ambient air ("breathing"). Then the closures may be equipped with desiccant filters to permit ac cess of dry air only. Some of the covers must be re moved to permit installation of the engine in the ve hicle. Others will be left in place until the engine is actually operated. To prevent being left in place in advertently, these closures must be readily accessible and clearly marked, such as with bright colors. Figure
10-17 shows locations of various protective closures for the Rocketdyne LR79-NA-11 engine.

10.6 CLUSTERING OF LIQUID-PROPELIAdNT ROCKET ENGINES

The idea of obtaining higher thrust levels expedi tiously through the combination of several smaller rockets probably is as old as rocketry itself. The topic of clustering still provokes spirited debate among de signers. Perhaps this reached a peak in March 1952
when, in a Collier's magazine article, Wernher yon Braun described a space vehicle having a first stage powered by a cluster of 51 turbopump-fed rocket engines.

Debate invariably turns around the deceptively simple question: Will higher overall reliability be obtained through a combination of well-developed smaller engines or through one large, specially-de veloped unit? The question has no simple answer.

The failure probability of the smaller units may be low, but it increases with the number of units clus tered. Reliability will not be a fixed value for either large or small, but rather will be a function of devel opment effort and  time. A realistic analysis, consid ering all factors, may  determine the appropriate choice; but the hard fact of the cost of going both routes for a given mission and of comparing final scores almost surely being prohibitive will preclude an absolute answer.

The clustering of liquid-propellant rocket en g i n e s - i n  other words, the subdivision of vehicle thrust into smaller unitsmmay be done a number of ways. The choice, for the most part, will be based on vehicle considerations. Depending on the method chosen, however, engine design will be directly af fected.

There are no hard-and-fast rules that will deter mine optimum cluster configurations. Liquid-engine clusters actually used in practice, however, do pro vide a guide for future designs.

Early Cluster Configurations

Figure 10-18 shows the cluster of two experimental LOX/alcohol engines for a planned but discontinued ballistic missile. It consisted of two units of 120,000 1b-thrust each. Both subunits had a gimballed tubular wall thrust chamber and a geared turbopump. The turbines were powered in parallel from a single, common gas generator and also had common con trols. Thus, this propulsion system was not a true clus ter, because it was not possible to develop and fire each unit independently. This engine powered sev eral successful experimental flights.

Figure 10-19 shows another experimental cluster consisting of three units that, although never flown, achieved a remarkable reliability record during static firings at thrust levels up to 500,000 lb. This cluster, too, used common controls and gas-generating sy s

Still another approach for ballistic missiles com bines a pair of booster engines with a large-expan sion-area sustainer engine. During flight, the booster engines may be jettisoned following the boost pe riod, while the sustainer continues, fed from the same tanks. Such a configuration has been termed a "one and-one-half-stage vehicle."

Recent Cluster Design Trends

The first U.S. clustered-engine vehicle~signifying the modern trend toward multipurpose engines~NASA's S-1 first-stage booster for the Saturn I, was powered by eight LOX/RP-1 engines, the basic elements of which were transplanted with relatively minor modifications from earlier engines. The S-1 is noteworthy for its tank arrangement---eight tanks from a precedent mis sile clustered around a central larger tank. This
"multicellular" design, which in the case of the S-1
permitted early availability of large tank capacity without major retooling, has been recommended by some vehicle designers for still larger vehicles. The eight engines of the S-1 are grouped into four fixed inner engines and four gimballed outer engines. Except for the outer-engine actuators, all eight are identical, independent units, built and tested singly, and combined for the first time on the vehicle proper.

In the S-l, the number of engines was, no doubt, almost entirely governed by the availability of exist ing major engine components and tankage. For sub sequent vehicles, such as the Saturn V three-stage ve hicle, greater freedom existed, particularly with re spect to the optimization of thrust and total impulse
(propellant load).

The Space Transportation System utilizes a clus ter of three liquid-oxygen/liquid-hydrogen main en gines installed in the Orbiter aft fuselage. These Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) run from liftoff until main-engine shutdown at approximately 510 s. Two large solid-rocket boosters, one attached to ei ther side of the external tank, supply additional thrust for the first stage of the flight. The clustered SSMEs take the tucked-in position for reentry and landing of the Orbiter. Figures 10-20 and 10-21 depict the instal lation of the SSME cluster.

Assume that payload and mission of a multistage vehicle have been defined and that stage propellant loads (total impulse) and tank geometry (diameter)
have been optimized. Assume further that engines are available and will not be redesigned, and that the op timum thrust for a typical stage suggests a range of four to six engines. An analysis has shown that pay load performance probably increases with the larger number of engines (Fig. 10-22), but there are other considerations.

One of the most influential will be the ability of a vehicle to complete its mission with one engine in operative (also see Chapter 2, "Thrust Level"). Engine provisions for "Engine-Out (EO) Capability" will be summarized in section 10.7. Engine-out always entails some performance loss, but it decreases with increas ing number of engines because less performance re serve will be needed, likewise less correcting thrust vector trim from the operating engines.

EO capability makes a substantial contribution to mission reliabilty, reducing cluster-failure potential by more than half.

Number of Engines

Figure 10-23 illustrates reliability at two points in engine overall development. As testing progresses, the difference between engine-out and no-engine-out narrows (see also Table 2-2). It may be stated that, for a given number of vehicle flights, the lower the en gine reliability, the greater will be the benefits of en gine-out. Figure 10-22, in combination with Fig. 10-23, shows that simultaneous addition of one engine and inclusion of engine-out capability retain about the same payload for a substantially higher cluster relia bility at any single-engine reliability level.

Cluster diameter in relation to vehicle diameter raises another important consideration. As discussed in section 10.7, all engines must fit into the inter stages to permit stage separation without interference. That condition does not restrict the first stage, but the degree of protrusion must be balanced against drag losses.

Specific considerations for some common en gine clusters may be summarized as follows (Fig. 10 24).

Four-engine cluster.  This configuration, in the groupings from four to six, offers optimum engine in terchangeability. All four engines will be gimballed. Only one installation is required: all inlet ducts and other engine-to-stage connections can be made iden tical. The thrust vector control (TVC) mode is sim plest: all engines deflect in pitch and yaw, and all ac tuators participate equally in roll control (Fig. 10 24a). The vehicle contractor's requirements will de cide the actual gimballing requirements.

Five-engine c lus ter .  Five engines provide greater thrust but complicate matters in other re spects. Of two basic arrangements possible, as shown in Fig. 10-24b and 10-24c, designers prefer the ar rangement with the center engine, mounted fixedm i.e., stiff-arms installed in place of gimbal actuators. It is advisable to install the engine with a complete gimbal bearing for standardization and ease of alignment. The remaining four engines can be gim

The centered engine, however, forces two installations and two sets of inlet ducts. The different length of the ducts affects pres sure drop and fluid velocity profile (engine turbo pump NPSH), waterhammer from closure of valves
(valve timing), trapped propellants, and possibly in sulation requirements (weight penalties and complex ity). Figure 10-25 shows a typical five-engine installa tion with fixed center engine.

With all five engines arranged on a circle, the ba sic engine package may become more uniform, since all will be gimballed. However, the five engines will need three different installations (Fig. 10-24c), and will seriously affect systems TVC response, because of roll and yaw coupling, particularly under malfunction conditions. As to mounting-circle diameter, the two five-engine clusters are about equal.

Six-engine cluster. This combination provides the highest thrust, at the expense of a larger mount ing circle. This in turn increases the effects of one engine-out on trim required and may compound in terstage and inter-engine clearance problems. In simplicity the control mode is comparable to the four-engine cluster. The six-engine cluster requires two installations, with inlet and other effects similar to those discussed with the five-engine configuration.

This cluster of six offers the potential of remov ing (not installing) two engines and still retaining a satisfactory four-engine combinat ion--added flexibil ity at minimum scar weight (i.e., weight of compo nents that cannot readily be removed along with the engines).

If at all possible, the engine designer should specify that the engine intended for cluster use be tested under  conditions c l o s e l y  s i m u l a t i n g  v e h i c l e i n s t a l l a t i o n .  It may be expected that the vehicle builder will conduct a firing program of his own; but this program must be devoted to cluster behavior and performance evaluation, and should not deterio rate into continued single-engine development.  A major difference between single-engine and cluster firing concerns the base conditions, i.e., the heat and pressure environment of the engines, particularly at altitude. Flame radiation effects, backwash of combus tion gases, and impingement may create much more severe conditions than are present during single-en gine firing. The pressure environment produced by several engines firing together may create moments on the engines that must be accounted for in the de sign of the gimbal system. The engine designer should be familiar with these conditions so that the claim that the engine can be clustered remains valid after delivery.

Awareness by engine designers of the considera tions governing engine clustering, as presented here, will enable them to complete a systems integration with a broader view to specific applications.

10.7 ENGINE-TO-VEHICLE INTERFACE

Throughout this book, references have been made to the ultimate purpose of rocket-engine design and production: propulsion of a vehicle. Some of the principal engine-to-vehicle interfaces, such as thrust mount, pneumatic fluid, and electrical and propellant lines, have been discussed in preceding chapters. This section will summarize a number of vital engine to-vehicle interfaces. The able engine designer will keep cognizant of them.

Des ign  D o c u m e n t a t i o n

Adequate mechanical design data, vital for the physi cal integration of engine into vehicle system, must be properly documen ted  b y  t h e  e n g i n e  s y s t e m s  d e s i g n e r ,  the following being considered minimum re quirements:

 Environmental conditions, such as engine compartment  thermal conditions at prelaunch, as cent, and, if applicable, on orbit and during re-entry and landing.

 Induced loads and vibration at all mechanical interfaces and aerodynamic loads on the nozzle for ascent, re-entry, and landing.

As a rule, this information will be compiled in detailed handbooks. Several years before the engines are delivered and handbooks  become available, however, the vehicle builder will need numerous en gine design details in support of the stage design.

These interface-design operational details will be contained in the interface control document (ICD), a contractual  entity that controls all of the en gine/vehicle interfaces. With a new program involv ing a new engine and a new vehicle, the basic release of the ICD usually has many specifics defined only as TBDs ("to be determined's"). A propulsion-system interface working group must coordinate further defi nition of the interfaces and properly document all interface requirements. Any drawing for either the engine or the vehicle interface must have a coded note that prohibits changes to mutually affected di mensions without proper coordination and subse quent changes to the ICD. A properly administered ICD has only design/operational  requirements and does not contain instructional information. The
"how to" and instructional information will be con tained in the engine-model handbook prepared by
"Logistics." Maintenance and handling information will also be defined in the various supporting logis tics manuals.

The ICD will describe operational requirements and character is t icsusuch as prestart conditioning, thrust buildup curves, steady-state performance, and thrust-decay characteristics--and fluids requirements, interface loads, thermal environment, mass proper ties, and electrical and software requirements.

Space Envelope

An engine being installed in a vehicle not only must be properly bolted to the vehicle thrust mount, but also, equally important, must be impeded by no other vehicle parts. Space in the engine compart ment of the vehicle must not only accommodate the engine envelope when in the neutral position (i.e., pointing straight aft) but also when fully deflected in all directions. Typical maximum engine deflections range from 4 to 10 deg. For clusters, moreover, the possibility of faulty deflection of engines must be taken into account. Because space in the engine compartment of a vehicle will usually be limited; en gine designer and vehicle builder must have the closest cooperation, especially for upper-stage clus ters, where large-expansion-area nozzles must be housed in a minimum interstage.

Connect  Panels

All engine-to-vehicle lines, which may amount to a dozen or more per engine, must be reliably connect ed for each engine installation, not only in the vehi cle but also in the static development  and accep tance-firing stands. It has been found beneficial to define this interface clearly by combining all lines in one or several terminal-connecting panels (Fig. 10 26).

These panels, uniformly designed for all test lo cations, may be mounted on the vehicle (or test stand) or on the engine. For certain installations it may be advantageous to have matching panels on

ENGINE SYSTEMS DESIGN INTEGRATION 365

both the vehicle (or stand) and the engine. Aligned a short distance apart, standardized jumper lines be tween pairs of panels will permit rapid and reliable connections. As a possible disadvantage of the panel method, routing a line through the panels may force additional line length, as compared to individual routing of each line. Through careful design and close coordination between the engine designer and the vehicle builder, and in consideration of optimum location, subdivision, and orientation of the panels, advantages will, in most cases, far outweigh disadvan tages.

Dynamic Interactions

Coupling between the propellant-feed system, the rocket engine, and the vehicle structure (as shown in Fig. 10-27) can result in a transient instability during launch commonly called "POGO." Typically it is rec ognized in data as a low-frequency oscillation (5-50
Hz) that grows out of the noise, levels off, and then decays back into the noise. This phenomenon was first seen in early unmanned flights of the Titan Gemini that observers likened to the motion of a child bouncing on a pogo stick. Evidence of POGO can be seen in the inlet-pressure measurement of Fig.
10-27.

The problem (as indicated schematically in fig.
10-28) involves the vehicle structure, the columns of propellant in the feed lines, and the engines. The structure supports the engine while the engine sup ports the propellant mass during powered flight. During axial low-frequency vehicle vibration as the engine moves forward, (relative to the vehicle) fluid compression at the engine inlet causes the local pressure to increase. This pressure fluctuation produces an upward force on the propellant column and an equal downward force on the engine and structure. The pressure also causes an increase in flow into the engine, resulting in an upward-thrust component  on the structure. If this upward-thrust component  exceeds the downward force caused by the engine-inlet pressure fluctuation, the consequence will be a negative damping component on the struc ture. That will cause an instability, with divergent os cillations, if it exceeds the inherent structural damp ing of the vehicle. Circumstances resulting in an in stability can tune the dominant propellant-feed line to a major vehicle structural resonance. Such tuning and detuning occur naturally during flight as propellant in the tanks is consumed.

The engine has two significant effects on the
"POGO loop." It forms the lower boundary for the propellant-system and provides compliance and loss so that it helps define propellant system resonant frequencies and damping. More importantly, the en gine sets the variation in upward thrust generated by a variation in inlet pressure. This so-called "engine gain" is critical to the evaluation of stability. In manned vehicles, for which 1/4 g POGO acceleration has been established as the crew limit, the frequency dependent  "engine gain" can be obtained empir ically to preclude the possibility of a potentially disastrous instability. Unmanned vehicles often ap

When analysis predicts or flight data indicates POGO, the usual approach attempts to prevent tuning of the feed system and structure by use of a compli ant device in the feed line near the engine inlet. Devices to do this detuning include helium-filled ac cumulators, spring-loaded piston accumulators, gas tuned stand pipes, and compliant duct walls. The Space Shuttle used an accumulator with a gaseous oxygen ullage and automatic level control that was contained within the engine oxidizer-feed system.

Avoiding POGO on a launch vehicle requires in teraction between several disciplines. Like the flutter problem in aircraft, POGO occurs only during flight. Consequently, the dynamics of the subsystem must be mathematically described so that system stability can be estimated from simulation of in-flight cou pling.

POGO-suppression devices.  The devices used to attenuate the flow perturbations in the Titan II feedlines (Fig. 10-29 and 10-30) resemble in opera tion the surge tanks employed in the pressure regula tion of large pipelines that have water-hammer prob lems. Surge tanks have been used as pressure-stabiliz ing devices in the flow lines of hydroelectric plants and pumping stations for more than 50 years; they serve as a point of pressure relief or cushion when ever there is a sudden change in flow. Vehicle feed lines, however, need suppression in a specific fre quency range, and that necessitates a specially tuned surge-system. By selection of the proper  damping and spring characteristics, the pressure perturbations



366 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES in the line can be absorbed by the suppression de vice and, in effect, uncouple the engine from the structural feedback loop.

In the Titan II, an entrapped gas bubble was in corporated in the oxidizer-line standpipe to provide a cushion or soft spring for the oxidizer mass in the standpipe to act on (Fig. 10-29); the energy due to pressure oscillations in the feedline can be trans ferred to this spring-mass system by judicious choice of the volume or height of the entrapped bubble. The fuel feedlines incorporated piston-type accumu lators that utilize a mechanical helical spring and pis ton arrangement to give the desired soft spring-ac tion (Fig. 10-30); the fixed mass of the spring and pis ton along with the mass of fuel in the accumulator provided the equivalent mass required for a resonant system.

The suppression devices were constructed and tuned so that their frequency responses, coupled with the appropriate feedline characteristics, would pro vide maximum attenuation of pump suction-pressure oscillations that were excited by tank-structure oscilla tions. The combined system could be optimized for maximum attenuation in a specified frequency range.

POGO oscillations also occurred in the Saturn V vehicle during boost flight. The frequency involved,
5 Hz, happened to be the natural frequency of the combustion process of the F-1 engines and of the en tire Saturn V vehicle including the spacecraft. The vibration increased as propellants were consumed because the natural frequency of the vehicle in creased. The frequency approached 5.5 Hz about 125
s after liftoff. While not necessarily destructive, the vibration had to be attenuated because it placed an undesirable acceleration on the crew. The design solution was to deter the two frequencies by placing a pneumatic spring in the liquid-oxygen feedline of each of the five F-1 booster engines. Cavities in the

LOX prevalves for the engines provided convenient volumes for introducing gaseous helium, which does not condense at LOX temperature, to act as de-tuners.

A POGO suppression system in the LOX-feed sys tem of the SSME at the inlet of the high-pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) utilizes a gas-filled ac cumulator to suppress vehicle-induced flow oscilla tions. Gaseous oxygen tapped off the heat exchanger in the oxidizer-tank pressurization system acts as the compliant  med ium following an initial hel ium precharge. The system controls liquid level in the accumulator by means of a line that routes overflow fluids to the inlet of the low-pressure oxygen turbop ump (LPOTP).

In the SSME's POGO suppression (see Fig. 10-31), the heart of the system, the gas-filled accumulator, serves as a capacitance in the LOX-flow circuit and prevents the transmission of the low-frequency (20-30
Hz) flow oscillations into the HPOTP. The system is sized to provide sufficient overflow at the maximum decreasing pressure transient in the LPOTP discharge duct. The engine controller supplies valve actuation signals and monitors system operation.

Engine-failure sensing and shutoff system
(EFSS). Such systems have been in use since the early days of liquid rocketry. They are especially im portant during engine and early cluster development. Part of them may later become a portion of flight emergency detection systems (EDS) and engine-out systems (see Chapter 2). The following list (not nec essarily complete) of major engine-oriented malfunc tions should be considered:

Because of their potential for sudden destructive effects, many of the malfunctions will be sensed and the signals used to initiate immediate automatic shutdown. For others, which would not create an emergency within, say, fractions of a second, it is not uncommon to simply record their allowable mini mum/maximum values using the test data computer. If the test data goes outside of the safe region, the computer can initiate shutdown.

For flight, a few highly critical parameters of the EFSS may be retained for automatic engine shutdown or mission abort. In this case, if the engine-failure sensing and shutoff system shuts down an engine yet the flight continues with the remaining engines, a ve hicle-mounted electronic logic must sense the shut down and take certain actions, including these:

 Closing emergency-shutoff valves in the ducts to the defunct engine, but not those in the others.

 Disconnecting electric power to the defunct engine only.

 Resetting or disarming backup shutdown timers, since the reduced number of engines will consume the available propellants over a longer pe riod of time.

 Locking the defunct engine in the neutral gim bal position.

Heat protect ion.  The liquid-propellant rocket engine is a technological rarity, in which hot and cold temperature extremes must be handled together:
insulation to maintain temperatures as low as -423"F in certain ducts, heaters to protect sensitive compo nents against these temperatures. At the same time, in other areas at or around the engine, protection must be provided against the very high temperatures of the combustion process and the emerging gas jet, such as the cooling of the thrust chamber. The ex haust jet, at sea level, usually does not pose a major problem, unless blowback occurs from the flame de flector. At higher altitudes with vacuum or near-vac uum pressures, however, which are experienced even by first stages of a vehicle over the last portion of its flight, a substantial portion of the thrust-chamber gas jet expands sideways from the nozzle exit, forming a plume, creating considerable backwash and radiating powerfully back into the engine compartment. This endangers both engine and vehicle componen t sm can cause surface temperatures of I O00"F or more without heat protection. In some cases it may be too cumbersome or costly in weight to provide individ ual insulation for each component. A protective heat

Center-engine flame-impingement shield, forming a closeout diaphragm, may then be more effective (Fig. 10-32). This shield may be sup ported from a stationary (center) engine, if available, or from a supporting structure.

Design and installation of the base heat-shield requires the closest cooperation between engine and vehicle designer. The need for a partial or full close out must be determined through special model tests. In most designs the shield connects to the engine nozzle. Suitable brackets must therefore be provided. During gimballing the heat shield will resist the en gine motion. The forces encountered must be con sidered in the power budget for the hydraulic actua tors. It must be taken into account that the heat-shield flex curtains may be quite cold bemre engine start and may still remain relatively cool at the far side, as planned, during stage operation.

In addition to backwash and radiation, which usually will not harm the internally-cooled engine nozzle itself, mutual gas-jet impingement between en gines may occur from extreme deflection during gimballing. Excepting a major control malfunction, this impingement should affect the nozzle only for very brief periods near the exit. However, the heat may affect chamber structural elements, such as stiff ening bands, which are not internally cooled. A heat protective strip, a few inches wide, of ablative or other suitable material applied to the nozzle should suffice in most cases (Fig. 10-33). Obviously, single engine vehicles do not need this type of protection.

For both, early cooperation will be essential between the engine designer and the vehicle builder to arrive at a mutually feasible solution. Without this collaboration, the optimistic note in engine drawings "to be sup plied by vehicle contractor" will accomplish little.

Certain engine subsystems, such as hydraulic components,  control systems, and valve-actuation mechanisms, can function properly only if they come within a specified temperature range. Engine systems not employing cryogenic propellants may be dependent  on heating or cooling only during pro longed coasting times in space. Engine systems that do use cryogenic propellants almost always need at least some heating. The cryogenic propellants within the engine, following start of tanking and the heat ab sorption of tank surfaces and lines, may rapidly lower the air temperature surrounding the engine to a few hundred degrees below 0"F.

Most vehicle systems will specify an allowable hold period, following tanking, to allow adjustments and checkout of other systems and to await optimum launch times (rendezvous missions), etc. A hold pe riod exceeding the allowance may allow severe sub cooling of engine components.

The temperature environment can be substan tially improved by the vehicle builder through en gine-compartment purges with warm gas (Fig. 10-34). An inert gas will bring the additional advantage of counteracting the accumulation of combustible gas mixtures from minor leaks. However, the vehicle builder's possibilities of heating through use of com partment gas purges are definitely limited. Some of the limitations stem from the engine designer's own specifications, which require avoidance of elevated temperatures around components  containing cryo genic fluids to minimize boiloff and to prevent for mation of gas bubbles. Also, certain structural mere


ENGINE SYSTEMS DESIGN INTEGRATION 369

bers must be kept below maximum temperatures be cause of their strength characteristics. Moreover, the purge-gas requirements and necessary heating provi sions would become prohibitive if attempts were made to raise compartment temperatures above 32F or even to 0"F. Figure 10-35 shows the effects of in creasing purge flow and temperatures over those of Fig. 10-34. The analyses on which the graphs are based have shown that a further increase of the purge rate to 12,000 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM)
and 250F barely raises the interstage temperature above 0F. At the same time, the propellant boiloff rates in exposed ducts increased tenfold over those under  the conditions of Fig. 10-34. The locations quoted are identified in Fig. 10-36.

For most applications the purges to the various areas will be made from a ground source. Once pre conditioned, affected components  can be expected to maintain their temperature within an allowable band after vehicle liftoff during the relatively short boost-periods. Only stages with prolonged cruising times may require an onboard purge supply system;
that imposes payload penalties.

Literally a few inches away from the components requiring protection against low temperatures will be others that must be protected against warmup due to influx of heat. Here again, noncryogenic propellants pose few problems. By contrast, however, cryogenic systems, in particular those including liquid hydro gen, are very sensitive to heat influx. The effects on pump NPSH, which includes the vapor pressure of the fluid pumped, have been discussed in detail in section 8.5 in connection with tank insulation. For engine start, which involves the cryogenic fluids stored in the ducts immediately upstream of the en gine and within the engine itself, insulation may be come prohibitively complex. Continuous removal of superheated cryogenic fluids from the engine system and substitution of fresh liquid, therefore, has been widely used. This removal can be accomplished through continuous overboard bleeding or through recirculation back to the tank. In both cases, the liq uids are tapped off at a point farthest away from the pump inlets and routed to the stage for overboard dumping or return to the tanks. A small auxiliary pump has often been required to obtain the mini mum flowrates required for adequate bleeding.

During engine development,  and even during vehicle static-firing programs, relatively favorable prestart conditions exist: the enclosing interstage is not in place, hold periods are under better control, and cold lower-stage tank surfaces are absent. But what worked faultlessly under these conditions may well fail in vehicle flight. A realistic recognition of this situation and close coordination between the two design teams will therefore be vital during the early phases of engine a n d  vehicle design and develop ment.

For first-stage applications, the engine builder stays relatively independent  regarding start charac teristics and sequence. The vehicle will not take off until thrust exceeds vehicle weight; gravity holds the propellants at the tank outlets; and all parameters are closely monitored from the ground control center. A holddown period before vehicle release and takeoff introduces an additional safety margin.

For upper-stage engine start, conditions become considerably more complicated. Absence of the propellant-settling effects of gravitation, the sur rounding vacuum, temperature conditions at altitude, and remoteness from ground stations can only be crudely simulated in ground tests. Until first flights of a new vehicle have been made, therefore, the engine in-flight start sequence, which is closely interwoven with the stage separation sequence, must be based largely on analytical work. Neither vehicle builder nor engine designer can do this without considera tion of, and consultation with, the other. The follow ing principal relationships must be considered.

Starting the upper-stage engines while the lower stage is still at full-thrust level is difficult, mainly be cause of flame impingement and exhaust-gas dissipa tion from the interstage. Engine start will therefore preferably follow stage separation; but then propel

370 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES lant settling from acceleration effects of the lower stage can no longer be assured. Auxiliary propellant settling ("ullage") rockets (usually solid-propellant type) are required instead during engine starts. These add weight and drag and reduce payload. The size of the weight penalty, in turn, depends on engine-start characteristics (thrust-buildup time). For engines with relatively protracted buildup times, advanced initia tion (with respect to lower-stage thrust decay and separation) of upper-stage engine start may substan tially reduce the penalties. One second, lopped off the ullage-rocket burning times, may save hundreds of pounds of stage weight. The same amount of time added may not only reduce payload weight but may also pose serious control problems to the space ve hicle, which floats essentially "rudderless" after sepa ration and before the start of its own engines. From the foregoing requirements, the need for thorough mutual understanding of this important vehicle-to engine interface becomes apparent.

Vibration env i ronment .  Even a normally or
"smoothly" operating rocket engine generates a vi bration pattern transmitted mechanically through the thrust mount, or acoustically through the ambient atmosphere, if present, to the vehicle structure. Neglect of these vibrations by the vehicle builder may lead to serious structural weakness or malfunc tion of vital control organs mounted to the vehicle structure. Means of reducing the normal engine vi brations are limited and hard to analyze. Rather, it is important that the engine developers establish, as accurately as they can, the existing acoustic and vi bration pattern and inform the vehicle builder of their findings. Inability of the tiedown-firing mea surements reliably to predict free-flight conditions imposes a serious handicap. However, through a thorough understanding of the potential and through specifications of static-test and flight measurements, in cooperation with the vehicle builder the engine designer can greatly help reduce the incidence of se rious problems.

N o z z l e  e x p a n s i o n  a r e a  ratio.  From his own analyses, the engine designer may have selected a nozzle expansion area ratio that appears to be an op timum compromise among engine weight, perfor mance, size, and producibility. When analyzed in the larger framework of vehicle performance, however, the selection may turn out not to be optimum. For stages with engine clusters, in particular, upper stages, the following factors must be considered (single-en gine first stages disregarded here because least af fected):

Gimbal angle. Following determination of the maximum gimbal angle required for safe vehicle guidance, including consideration of actuation mal functions, the nozzle exit diameter will determine the attachment-point distances (mounting pattern) of the engines in a cluster.

Vehicle diameter. When mounted for proper gimbal capability, the envelope of the engine cluster must be in proper relationship to the vehicle diame ter. If the cluster envelope is too large, the increase in vehicle dimensions may void all gains from a larger expansion area ratio.

Interstage length. When the upper-stage engines are mounted to the lower stage their length will de termine the length of the required interstage. For a vehicle of the Saturn V class, each additional inch of interstage length will cost approximately 40 lb. Thus, here too, the added interstage weight required to ac commodate a longer, better-performing nozzle may void the theoretical gains.

Stage separation. Separating the stages of a space vehicle entails three basic possibilities:

1) Leaving the interstage with the lower stage. This procedure requires the engines to pull out of the interstage cylinder during separa tion (Fig. 10-37). Marginal clearance between en gine skirts and the interstage wall may force complicated means to avoid collisions between the separating stages. These may include a con trol system to tuck the engines inward and then swing them out upon separation and start them. Any such system adds complexity, lowers reliabil ity, and may add weight. A shorter nozzle skirt of lesser diameter, although of somewhat lesser per formance, may be better overall.

2) Leaving the interstage with the upper stage. To avoid the problem of stage collisions, it may appear attractive to leave the interstage at tached to the upper stage. This adds inert weight to the upper stage, a penalty that may prove con siderably larger than the performance loss from a somewhat shorter nozzle. A control problem may also be incurred in that the engine nozzles, in their outward gimbal deflection, still must clear the interstage wall. In joint optimization studies, the engine designer and the vehicle builder may weigh the possibility of leaving part of the interstage with either stage.

3) Leaving the interstage with the upperstage but dropping it in a second separation maneuver several seconds after first separation. In this dual-separation sequence, the second separation may consist of shedding the interstage as a com plete ring, possibly in combination with guide rails, or of blowing it off to the side in segments. Either method requires some form of actuation in addition to accurate timing. Also, while the in terstage is still attached, a serious base-heating



ENGINE SYSTEMS DESIGN INTEGRATION 371

problem may develop. The requirement to over come any difficulties may increase complexity and reduce reliability and partially neutralize nozzle-performance gains.

Whichever method is applied, the thrust-decay characteristics of the spent lower-stage engines great ly affect the separation sequence and the clearances. To optimize these, the vehicle builder needs accurate information on thrust-decay characteristics and toler ances from the engine designer. This information may take the form of a graph, as shown in Fig. 10-38.

Flame-deflector size.  Engine nozzle size and arrangement on the vehicle, together with maximum gimbal angles, strongly influence the design of flame deflectors on engine and stage static-firing test stands and launcher flame-deflectors. Here, the problem is not so much one of optimizing vehicle performance, but of minimizing cost and of assuring the adequacy of these indispensable development tools.

Engine Handling, Installation, and Servicing Fixtures

For handling engine parts and assemblies during en gine.installation into development test stands and for various servicing functions, the engine builder re quires numerous fixtures commonly referred to as ground support equipment (GSE). Some of these fix tures can be used by the vehicle contractor as de signed, and others can be used for only a few minor changes or additions. GSE takes substantial funding in a typical vehicle program. Common use of as many of these fixtures asposs ible  by the engine designer and the vehicle builder is strongly advised. To ensure this, the two must work together from the earliest de sign steps.

Standardization

The task of mating engine and vehicle will be sub stantially facilitated if the designers of both work to the same standards. This requirement applies to na tional, government, and company standards; to ter minology and to mathematical symbols; and to the measuring system (metric or English, decimals or fractions, tolerances). Since several avenues are open, it is necessary, at the very outset, to agree on which one shall be pursued. This task requires close coop eration and full documentation.

Delivery Schedule

For the vehicle builder to deliver the stage on time, complete and equipped with engines, the engines must be available to him with sufficient lead-time. If the engine builder is directly contracted by the vehi cle contractor, this schedule can be negotiated and followed up in a straightforward manner. In most cases, however, particularly with large liquid-propel lant engines, these will be supplied to the vehicle contractor as government-furnished equipment
(GFE). The engine supplier may not necessarily be fully cognizant, therefore, of the detailed vehicle needs. In either case, to avoid sudden unexpected compression of schedules the engine designer and developer must make sure that schedules for design, drawing release, manufacture, development, and en gine delivery are in accordance with the vehicle needs.

Maintenance and Logistics

For systems not man-rated, until reliable and eco nomic methods are developed to recover and refur bish rocket vehicles, rocket engines will ordinarily be used only once in flight, preceded by a reasonable number of checkout and acceptance firings. The en girie model specification will include the total pre scribed run capability (lifetime) of the engine, usually expressed in multiples of the rated flight d~ration. A factor of, for instance, 6, which includes a reserve for repetition of checkout runs, is typical. Because of the stringent weight considerations in rocket vehicles, engine design attempts to assure this life expectancy, but no more. Although reasonable safety factors make it most unlikely that the engine would com pletely collapse shortly after exceeding the allowable maximum run-time, the statistical probability of some engine part failing does increase. For this rea son, most engine specifications prescribe overhauls of a stated scope whenever this limit is exceeded.

Similarly, upper limits are set for storage times. Exceeding these will trigger routine replacement of certain engine parts, notably of gaskets and seals. Rocket-engine preservation and packaging methods are well developed, permitting storage periods ex ceeding five years without overhaul.

During shipping, handling, installation, servicing, checkout, static firing, and launch preparation, dam age of various types may be incurred by the engine because of parts failures, mishandling, oversights, or accidents. All incidents must be corrected by repair and/or parts replacements.

Any or all of the described maintenance actions may be required either while the engine remainsl with the engine builder or following its delivery to the vehicle contractor. An accurate and effective

372 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES maintenance or logistics plan must be worked out be tween the two contractors, or with their contracting agency, considering all handling needs at all test sta tions. This plan will include the conditions under which an engine should be returned to the factory for overhauls, repairs, and parts replacements. If return is not required, the correct handling fixtures and tools must be provided for each location. Above all, an adequate stock of spare parts must be planned. The engine designers will frequently be consulted for their advice in an effort to avoid both time losses due to lack of parts and costly overstocking.

MuRiple-Engine Use

In view of the cost of rocket-engine design, develop ment, and procurement, common usage of a given engine for several vehicles, or for several stages of the same vehicle, will be very desirable. Also, com mon usage can substantially reduce or simplify logis tics, handling, checkout, launch preparation, and in strumentation requirements. Caution must be exer cised, however, not to go "overboard," lest engine-to vehicle interfaces become considerably more com plicated.

Effort should be concentrated on the common usage of the major cost items and engine building blocks, such as turbopumps, injectors, combustion chambers, gas generators, valves, gimbal blocks, and high-pressure ducts. Peripheral equipment, such as instrtlmentation lines, servicing lines, inlet ducts, and wire connections, should be left flexible enough to adapt them to each vehicle without compromise. It is tempting for procuring agencies to warehouse just one engine model and to ship "from the shelf" to wherever the need arises. This convenience, however, may cost substantially more than the expected sav ings: in mission compromises, reduced reliability, in creased coordination effort between engine builder and vehicle builders, substantially increased possibil ity of oversights and communication gaps, and cost and time-consuming retrofits. As always, a thorough and unbiased joint analysis considering all aspects, including that of the long-range future, will readily yield information about the point of diminishing re turns.

Reserves and Safety Margins

In the engine designer's negotiations with the engine user, i.e., "the customer," which quite likely is a gov ernment agency, the engine designer, like the vehicle builder, will frequently find himself under pressure to compromise. This compromise may be to cut weight or to accelerate schedules. It is then that designers will be most in need of their top management's un derstanding and support. But it is here also where they will be most criticized if their analyses prove in complete, superficial, not optimized, or heavily bi ased by safety factor upon safety factor. Striking an optimum balance between high performance and adequate safety-factor reserves represents one of the finest arts of engineering and is directly translatable into the degree of success. Once certain that this bal ance has been achieved, or concerned that it may be lost, the designer should go on record. Doing so, the designer should also remember Edmund Berkeley's observation: "Thoughtful and tolerant disagreement is the finest climate for scientific progress."



Chapter 11

Design of Liquid-Propellant Space Engines

Liquid-propellant space engines embody the same operating principles and general characteristics as the liquid-propellant rocket systems previously discussed. However, their specific missions for use in spacecraft require special design considerations, as described in this chapter.

11.1 PRINCIPAL SPACE APPLICATION

By definition, space engines supply all the forms of rocket propulsion that a spacecraft requires for var ious maneuvers in space, including attitude control and stabilization, coplanar and interplanar orbit changes, trajectory corrections, rendezvous maneu vers, lunar and planetary landings and takeoffs, and retrofiring (reversed thrust for deceleration) during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. The thrust of a space engine may be a fraction of a pound or many thousands of pounds. Aside from a few solid-pro pellant motors (used mainly for perigee and apogee propulsion for raising orbits) and stored-gas systems
(used only in applications for thrust levels less than
1.0 lb and for a total impulse of less than 5000 lb-s), the majority of space engines employ liquid pro pellants. Because of inherent operational advantages, liquid systems likely will continue to dominate the space-engine field for the foreseeable future.

Liquid-propellant space engine systems may be divided into two basic groups: vehicle main propul sion and reaction control. These differ not only in function and thrust level but also in the type of propellant used, the degree of required control lability and thrust variation, and system components. But common to virtually all of them will be the requirement that they be able to start and operate reliably in the cold vacuum of space.

Spacecraft Main Propulsion

The main propulsion for most spacecraft has em ployed pressure-fed, storable hypergolic propellants, such as the Transtage propulsion system, with a thrust level of 16,000 lb. The systems include propellant tanks and pressurization system, control valves, main thrust-chamber assembly or assemblies, and a gimbal mechanism or some other type of thrust-vector con trol. Most main thrust chambers are ablatively or regeneratively cooled, sometimes with radiation cooled nozzle extensions.

A few spacecraft have used pump-fed systems, such as the 17,000-1b-thrust pump-fed engine for the Agena. As missions become more ambitious, requir ing greater delta-V and higher-energy cryogenic propellants, pump-fed systems become increasingly important in spacecraft propulsion. Most space mis sions require multiple starts (sometimes over a long period of time) and may require throttling. These re quirements usually account for the principal dif ferences between the main propulsion systems for spacecraft and those for booster vehicles.

Reaction Control

Reaction-control systems differ from other liquid propellant rockets in design arrangement and thrust level, which may run from 1 up to 1000 lb, with most systems falling within the 1-to-100-1b range. These systems may be used to provide attitude control, to align a spacecraft for a midcourse corrective or ter minal maneuver, to rendezvous with another vehicle, and to stabilize the vehicle after separation from another stage or during Earth re-entry.

As a rule, attitude-control engines are used in opposing pairs to produce pure couples about an axis. They are often mounted in clusters to simplify plumbing and wiring. Parallel pairs of engines, or individual units, produce the translational move ments along the vehicle axis, as in rendezvous and docking maneuvers.

The reaction-control engine systems are usually pressure-fed, using monopropellants or storable hy pergolic propellants. Thrust level and duration must be very closely controllable. The thrust chambers may be ablatively or radiation cooled, depending on the application.

Application Example

The application of various space engine systems may best be illustrated by typical examples, such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter, which has onboard propulsion for orbital maneuvering and attitude control. The orbital maneuvering system (OMS) provides axial thrust for orbit insertion, orbit circularization, orbit transfer, rendezvous, deorbit, and various abort scenarios. The reaction control system (RCS) pro vides thrust for three-axis attitude maneuvers and small translation maneuvers. Both systems are pres sure-fed and use nitrogen tetroxide (N20 4) oxidizer and monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) fuel. The pro pellants are earth-storable and hypergolic.

The OMS is mounted in two identical pods in the rear of the Orbiter, as shown in Fig. 11-1. Each pod contains about 12,000 lb of propellants and a single
6000-1b-thrust OMS engine. The tanks are pressurized with high-pressure helium; high-pressure nitrogen supplies engine purge and valve operation. After each engine burn, nitrogen purges propellants from the engine downstream of the bipropellant valve. This procedure allows up to 10 restarts per flight. The reusable OMS has been designed for 100 missions with 1000 engine starts and up to 15 hr of cumulative firing time.

The OMS engines are gimballed in the pitch and yaw planes. RCS operation is not required during OMS burns unless gimbal capabilities are exceeded or a single OMS engine is used. Redundancy is pro vided. The aft RCS thrusters can provide any of the OMS maneuvers. Propellant can be transferred from the OMS tanks to the aft RCS tanks and between the left and right OMS pods.

The RCS has both fore and aft positions, as shown in Fig. 11-2; the forward RCS, in the fuselage nose area; the rear RCS, in each of the pods con taining an OMS. Each of the three systems contains

primary thrusters, with a thrust level of 870 lb, and two vernier thrusters with 24 lb of thrust. Each of the aft systems includes 12 primary thrusters and two vernier thrusters. The primary thrusters can perform all RCS tasks; multiple units provide redundancy. Vernier thrusters usually will be preferred for attitude control in orbit. Because primary thrusters can also be used, redundancy is not provided for the verniers.

The primary RCS thrusters can sustain 20,000
starts and cumulatively 12,800 s of firing duration. The engines can be pulsed in durations as low as 0.08
s. Continuous steady-state thrusting can run from 1
to 150 s. In the event of OMS engine failure, the aft facing engines have a maximum single-mission firing capability of 800 s, and the forward facing engines can fire for 300 s. The vernier thrusters are capable of 330,000 starts and 125,000-s duration. They can provide steady-state burns of 1 to 125 s and pulses as low as 0.08 s.

11.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Before the actual design of a space system, it is necessary to examine the basic engine parameters to determine their influence on the spacecraft's ability to perform its intended mission. An overriding consideration will be reliability. Typical space mis sions include the establishment of an orbit around a planet following a transfer from Earth, which may last several months or years. The ability of a propulsion

Expander cycles are therefore more attractive for space engines since they are generally limited to relatively low chamber-pressures.

4) Engine system design. Experience has shown that multiple-start operation, as required by most space-engine systems, has a more severe effect on a rocket engine than has continuous steady-state oper ation of comparable firing duration. This should be expected, because continuous operation involves a minimum of control components and actuations. Multiple starts, on the other hand, require that each component responds perfectly each time it is called upon. In addition, multiple starts require much longer periods of minimum leakage by propellant and pressurant. More rigorous approaches toward improved reliability, such as component or subsys tem redundancies, must therefore be considered in the design.

5) Engine-system component design. Besides mission environmental effects (to be discussed below), detailed design of the engine-system components will be directly affected by the space craft configuration. For instance, the location of the engine-system (internal in or external to the spacecraft) determines the feasibility of radiation cooling for the thrust chamber. Engine envelope limitations affect the choice of nozzle type, allowable expansion area ratio, and even the feed-system type.

In some applications, the propulsion system can be operated on a propellant-tank-ullage-gas blow down principle during the latter portion of the mission. This could reduce the required amount of pressurant (and pressurant-tank volume) by as much as one-half of that for a regulated, constant-pressure system.

The critical start of the main thrust chamber will not need ignition devices if the system uses hy pergolic propellants. However, careful sequencing of the propellant flows during start will usually be required to avoid pressure spikes and instabilities.

Nonhypergolic propellants typcially employ augmented spark igniters (ASI)--essentially spark plugs recessed into a cavity in the combustion cham ber. Propellants fed into the ASI ignite and light the main combustion chamber.

Various schemes have been considered and developed for the deep throttling often required by spacecraft main propulsion systems. For instance, the Apollo LEM descent engine was required to vary thrust continuously over a range from 1050 to 10,500
lb to permit hovering, selection of a landing site, and the landing itself.

The most straightforward means of throttling- valves in the main propellant l inesmcan give throttling ratios of about 3:1. Other components must also be designed to accomodate the throttling. The injector pressure drop must be high enough to promote  good mixing and atomization of the propellants as well as to prevent dynamic instabilities between the combustion chamber and feed-system components. Since the injector pressure drop varies with the square of the flowrate for liquid propellants and directly with the flowrate for gaseous and super critical propellants, the design point pressure drops will typically be higher for a throttling engine than for a fixed-thrust design. Similarly, the turbopumps
(in a pump-fed system) must be able to accom modate a wider operating range without experiencing stall or unstable operation, and control valves must provide adequate control margins over a wider operating range. If the thrust chamber is regen eratively cooled, the heat flux will fall off more slowly than the coolant flow as the thrust is reduced, so the cooling margins must be greater than with a fixed thrust engine.

Some means of varying the injector area will allow higher throttling ratiosmsuch as two or more manifolds with separate valving so that only some of the injector elements will be used during throttling;
but this method adds complexity to the hardware and control system and will usually lower combustion efficiency. Another method makes use of pintles to change the injector flow area, which allows control over injector pressure drop with drop in the flowrate, again adding complexity.

Figure 11-4 presents the schematic of the propulsion system for Transtage, an upper stage used with the Titan launch vehicle to make orbit insertion, orbit modification, and rendezvous maneuvers. A pressure-fed system with multiple-restart capability, it uses about 23,000 lb of N204/50-50 propellants.

The Transtage has two engines that share propellant tanks, pressurization system, and electrical and mounting systems. Two interconnected spher ical helium tanks, initially at 3600 psia, hold pressurant to maintain the tanks at a regulated 160 psia pressure. When restarting in space, attitude control engines settle the propellants in the main tanks preparatory to engine start. Each Transtage engine develops 8000 lb of thrust and operates at a chamber pressure of 105 psia with an area ratio of
40:1, for a delivered specific impulse of 310.6 s. The thrust chamber has ablative cooling and a radiation cooled extension made of aluminide-coated colum bium. Propellants are fed to the combustion cham ber through a bipropellant valve controlled by an electrically-actuated pilot valve.

In a complete space-vehicle system, performance gains of the spacecraft stages will effect increasing weight savings for each succeeding lower booster stage, as described in Chapter 2. Plans for future spacecraft missions usually consider high-perfor mance liquid propellants, such as O2/H 2. For high mission delta-V, these propellants in pump-fed systems usually give a considerable performance edge over pressure-fed systems. A pump-fed system for these applications must reliably supply high pressure propellants to the combustion chamber, under vacuum and zero-gravity conditions and after long periods of coasting. All pumps must be fully primed before starting the engine system to prevent delays in pump buildup and overspeeding. This may require ullage-settling rockets, before and during main engine start, or positive-propellant-expulsion devices. In addition, the systems should be able to restart (if possible from available tank-pressure energy, without auxiliary starting devices) and to throttle (for some applications over a wide range). Major design concerns associated with turbopumps under space environmental conditions (other than material considerations) include: vacuum, temper ature, and radiation effects on exposed high-speed bearings and dynamic seals; micrometeorite pen etration of fluid passages; and absence of the effects of gravitation on pump operation.

An example of an advanced, high-performance pump-fed space engine, the RS-44 (Fig. 11-5), has undergone detailed design and component testing. A 15,000-1b-thrust regeneratively-cooled O2/H2
engine intended for orbit-transfer stages and lunar and interplanetary flight, it employs an expander cycle and, due to the excellent properties of the hydrogen working fluid, operates at the relatively high chamber pressure of 1540 psia, which improves performance and reduces the size and weight of the engine. Its reliability has been raised by eliminating the hydraulic system, a step made possible by operation of the control valves and gimbal actuators by electric motors. Pneumatic override on the actuators provides redundancy. Low-pressure-drop ball valves are used in the major propellant lines. The engine can be continuously throttled from 100
down to 10% thrust and can also be operated at about 3% of full thrust in a pressure-fed tank-head idle mode to settle propellants in the tanks and to chill the engine efficiently before a start.

The RS-44 thrust chamber, a channel-wall design made of Narloy copper-al loy material,  has re generative cooling to an area ratio of 225:1. A radiation or dump-cooled extension can be added and can be fixed or extendible, depending on the application. Figure 11-5 shows an extendible nozzle with an overall area ratio of 625, which will produce a vacuum specific impulse of over 480 s. The injector uses concentric elements with a transpiration-cooled rigimesh face for long life. An electric spark igniter provides restart capability, and the design life is 10
hours total run time.

Another advanced pump-fed engine design, the XLR-132 (Fig. 11-6), delivers 3750 lb of thrust using N204 /MMH propellants.  Currently under  devel opment  for the Air Force by both the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International and the Aerojet Tech Systems Co., it will support a wide variety of space missions. (The following paragraphs describe the Rocketdyne version of the engine.)

Rocketdyne's design for the XLR-132 operates on a gas-generator cycle, shown schematically in Fig. 11 7. The gas generator feeds a single partial-admission turbine that drives two single-stage centrifugal pumps, one mounted  on each end of the turbine. The turbine-exhaust gases are collected in a manifold and injected through supersonic nozzles into the main nozzle and further expanded to provide thrust. The combustion chamber is regeneratively cooled with oxidizer to an area ratio of 50:1 and a radiation cooled columbium nozzle extension is attached for an overall area ratio of 400:1. The low-temperature turbine-exhaust gases provide additional film cooling for the forward portion of the extension. The engine operates at a chamber pressure of 1500 psia and pro duces a specific impulse greater than 340 s.

The XLR-132 is designed for multiple starts and an operating life of 10 yr in orbit. The start/cutoff

sequences are simplified to allow immediate restart and high reliability. The propellant valves, designed for long life, incorporate propellant filters, gas generator supply ports, trim orifices, and ports for propellant purging.

Main-Thrust-Chamber Design

In addition to the design elements presented in Chapter 4, primary requirements for thrust chambers of spacecraft main propulsion systems may include optimum steady-state cooling methods, with due consideration of application in space; ability to withstand postrun soakback, intermittent operation, and storage in the space environment; and ability to enter planetary atmospheres at high velocities.

Many of the thrust-chamber cooling techniques described in Chapter 4 can be applied to space engines, especially ablative cooling of thrust cham bers. Ablative-cooled chambers offer the inherent advantage of simplicity, ruggedness, and indepen dence of propellant coolant flows (including their pressure drops), and thus offset the factors of limited total life and relatively heavy weight. They are suitable for most pressure-fed space engine systems using earth-storable propellants at chamber pressures of less than 150 psia. In some applications, ablative cooling can be supplemented  by one or a combination of refractory throat-inserts, radiation cooled nozzle extension skirts, and propellant film cooling.

Selection of ablative material will be influenced by the propellants due to potential rapid reactions between the combustion products and the thrust chamber materials. With oxygen-based oxidizers
(e.g., oxygen, nitrogen tetroxide, nitric acid, etc.), an oxide-based or silicon-carbide fiber reinforcement must be used for laminated ablative liner and nozzle materials. Suitable materials include quartz, high silica glass, asbestos, and some ceramic fibers. Flu or ine-based oxidizers (e.g., fluorine, chlorine trifluoride, chlorine pentafluoride, etc.) require car bon fibers as the laminate reinforcement. Fuels containing carbon are not recommended with fluorine-based oxidizers due to build-up of pyrolitic graphite in the throat and throat-entrance region.

Ablative cooling changes the dimension of the chamber due to erosion during burning. Nozzle throat erosion, if predictable and controlled, may be acceptable for some engine systems; it becomes proport ionally less significant in larger thrust chambers. For fixed-area injectors and fixed pro pellant-supply pressures, propellant flow and engine thrust would increase with time, while specific impulse would decrease, due to throat enlargement. However, for a 40:1 expansion nozzle opera ted  in vacuum, the specific impulse loss would be only 0.5%, for as much as a 10% increase in throat area, if the aerodynamic characteristics of the nozzle contour did not deteriorate.

A refractory nozzle-throat insert represents one remedy against excessive throat erosion with oxygen based oxidizers. A ceramic, silicon carbide, has been used extensively for throat inserts in space-engine applications. It has a high melting point (4400F), excellent thermal-shock characteristics, relatively high thermal conductivity (115 Btu/h-ft2-'F/in.), low coefficient of thermal expansion (2.4x106 in./in.-F), excellent oxidation resistance, and high abrasion resistance. Sometimes, a molybdenum backup sleeve is used when the silicon carbide insert cannot con duct heat sufficiently. This material has good thermal-shock resistance for a ceramic, but the design of the throat must keep the cross-section thicknesses as thin and as constant as possible to prevent the insert from thermally cracking. Such throats are limited to about 2 in. in diam at the throat portion of the insert. Even then, throat diameters exceeding 1 in. are recommended only for steady-state firing conditions, because large inserts usually will crack and thus must be kept in place only by mechanical restraints imposed by the way the material cracks and interlocks. Throat erosion in larger thrust chambers can be reduced through the use of laminated silicon carbide-reinforced phenolic.

Throat erosion in engines using fluorine-based oxidizers can be minimized by the use of graphite or carbon-carbon throat inserts. The graphite inserts, however, have given mixed results and are not generally recommended, especially for pulsed opera tion. Carbon or graphite-fabric-reinforced phenolic ablative can protect chambers at low pressures (less than about 150 psia) with minimal erosion.

High-silica glass in the ablative material of the combustion chamber section may become fluid enough to be swept downstream and deposited in the throat section. This causes thrust variances and promotes an unsymmetrical velocity profile in this area. This danger may be prevented by a liner of JTA (45% graphite, 45% zirconium diboride, and 10%
silicon) inserted in the combustion zone. The liner is usually segmented to provide a path for the gases from the pyrolyzed ablative (and reduce the pressure drop across the liner) and prevent cracks that would develop in an expanding unsegmented liner.

Following the firing of an ablative thrust chamber, the heat stored in the chamber walls soaks into the unburned virgin material. This postrun soakback promotes further thermal degradation, which might also be affected by the vacuum con ditions, for 100 s or more, until the mean temperature of the char drops to about 500F. Gas generated and expelled by soakback charring will constitute about 15% of the weight of ablative material charred. This gas could cause a postrun residual impulse exceeding the desired minimum cutoff-impulse. However, this effect will be small for larger systems. For long-duration space missions, the temperature effects from solar radiation may cause vaporization of the ablative chamber material during coasting, and thus should be prevented if possible.

Ablative thrust chambers for space engines should be designed to permit many restarts. At the end of a specified total firing-duration (design values:
400-2000 s), sufficient insulation material must remain between char and structural shell to limit the adhesive-bond temperature between the ablative and shell to a specified maximum (typical design values are 350F for repeated firings and 500F for steady


382 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES state single firings). Any heat soakback during inter vals between firings should not affect total chamber duration. For high-silica-fabric-reinforced phenolic thrust chambers operated at pressures of 100-125
psia, using N204  and hydrazine- type fuels, the following empirical equat ions may be used to estimate char depth, including the effects of charring due to soakback:

For the combus t ion  z o n e  a n d  the throat  section
(with or without liner and/or insert):

a = 0.0415t 5 (11-1)

For nozz le  sections downstream o f  the throat:

a = O.0335t5e -247~ (11-2)

where a = char depth, in.; t = thrust chamber cu mulative firing duration, s; e = base of natural log arithms, 2.718; and E -- nozzle expansion area ratio at the section under consideration. Knowing the char depth based on design duration, including effects of soakback, the designer can calculate the thickness of the insulating layer needed to keep the outer wall at the required temperature.

Thrust chambers cooled only by radiation wiil be limited in application due to the high temperatures and thrust loads in the combustion zone and throat region. In contrast, the radiation-cooled nozzle skirt experiences lower heat flux and lower thrust loads, which can be accommodated by high-temperature materials. Radiation-cooled devices must "see"
space. Thus a radiation-cooled skirt should face out board, and not radial:e undesirable heat to vehicle componen t s .  Clustered engines  magnify this problem.

Nearly all radiation-cooled and ablatively-cooled thrust chambers  employ  some degree of film cooling, fuel being injected near the wall to provide some protection against the hot temperatures in the core flow. The fuel coolant can reduce the heat flux to the walls in the combustion chamber and on through the throat. This also reduces the problem of oxidizer impingement on the wall, which can occur if injector fabrication has not been controlled very closely. Oxidizer impingement  can cause severe erosion and key-holing of the throat, which will cause thrust misalignment. The degree of film cooling ranges from a few percent, which has an unmea surable effect on engine performance, to as high as
40%, which can reduce specific impulse by several percent.

For pump- fed  space eng ines  opera ted  at relatively high chamber pressures, or engines having long-life requirements, regeneratively-cooled thrust chambers are more suitable in terms of heat transfer. As a possible disadvantage, response time from start signal to full thrust may be substantially higher than with other cooling techniques. Spacecraft main propulsion systems usually do not, however, require rapid response.

Heat-transfer characteristics during throttl ing also may present problems; and coolant passages may be more susceptible to meteoroid damage than solid walls. In some applications, an opt imum overall design may combine regenerative cooling with film cooling and a radiation-cooled nozzle extension skirt.

An example of a pump-fed, regeneratively cooled space engine, the RL10 (see section I), powers the Centaur upper  stage of Atlas and Titan IV launch vehicles. First flown in 1963, the current RL10
(designated RL10A-3-3A) uses O2/H2 propellants and delivers 16,500 lb of thrust. The thrust chamber, constructed primarily of stainless-steel tubes, is regeneratively cooled with hydrogen, which is then used to drive the turbine in an expander cycle. The turbine drives a two-stage fuel pump directly and a single-stage oxidizer pump through a gearbox. The engine operates at a chamber pressure of 475 psia, has an area ratio of 61.1, and produces a specific impulse of 444 s at a mixture ratio of 5:1.

The Space Shuttle Orbiter OMS engine is an example  of a pressure-fed regenerat ively-cooled engine using Earth-storable propellants. The 6000-1b thrust engine is fuel cooled to an area ratio of 6:1
with a radiation-cooled extension to the final area ratio of 55:1. Channel-wall construction is employed in the regenerative portion and the extension is made of Columbian alloy.

Solenoid-operated bipropellant ball valves con trol fuel and oxidizer flows. Following engine shut down, gaseous nitrogen purges the fuel circuit downstream of the propellant valve for 2 s to clear the coolant jacket and injector of fuel, permitting safe engine restart. The engine uses a platelet injector, consisting of a stack of plates, each with an etched pattern that controls the distribution and velocity of the propellant. The stack is diffusion-bonded and welded to the body of the injector. The engine

operates at a chamber pressure of 125 psia and delivers a specific impulse of 313 s.

Design of Control Components

The various aspects of control-component  design have been discussed in Chapter 7. The following considerations particularly apply to the design of space-engine control components in general and of propellant valves in particular:

 Maximum reliability.
 Use of bellows for dynamic sealing in view of the need for long-term operating life in a vacuum environment.

 Combination hard and soft valve-seats to min imize leakage.

 Provision of a minimum of two seals and a vent between different propellants.

 Avoidance of sliding surfaces in components operating in a vacuum.

 Mechanical linkage (where possible) of the propellant-valve actuators by a mechanism that en sures positive, consistent, and synchronized opening and closing for smooth, repeatable ignition and thrust termination.

 Minimum electrical-energy requirements. The basic design details of the various control components for space-engine systems, such as pilot valves, regulators, and vent valves, are quite similar to those for booster-stage applications. The mechan ically-linked, poppet-type arrangement shown in Fig.
11-9 typifies main-propellant or propellant-isolation valves of space engines using hypergolic earth storable propellants. In the valve shown, placing the poppets in series causes the oxidizer poppet's motion to simultaneously move the fuel poppet. Welded bellows seals located at both ends of the fuel poppet and at the connection end of the oxidizer poppet completely separate fuel and oxidizer. The actuation chamber needs no bellows because fluid pressure acutates the valve. The center vent chamber between valve sections is the critical area where propellant mixing must be prevented. Both bellows would have to fail, however, to cause this failure mode (reliability through redundancy). This design also incorporates all-welded static sealing joints, all-metal construction except for the Teflon dynamic-poppet-valve seals, and hermetically-sealed solenoids or torque motors.

The valve is spring-loaded normally closed, and is also held closed by pressure imbalance when inlet pressure is applied. Allowing the oxidizer fluid to enter the actuation chamber at nominal oxidizer valve inlet pressure opens the valve and, in turn, overcomes the closing forces on the poppets. For on-off and isolation use, a three-way solenoid pilot valve actuates the fully open or closed valve positions. When energized, the valve actuation chamber is pressurized to open the poppets, and when de-energized, the same chamber is vented, allowing the pressure imbalance and springs to close the poppets.

In a bipropellant throttling valve, the position of the linked main poppets  is controlled by a servo pilot spool-valve that meters the control-fluid flow
(oxidizer) to the main valve-actuation chamber. The pilot spool valve, in turn, is proportionally po sitioned by a servo torque motor,, as a function of the command signal current and its polarity supplied from a servo amplifier. By means of properly shaped valve-poppet contours, the main throttling valves control the flow of oxidizer and fuel to the main thrust chamber at constant mixture ratio, and thus regulate the main chamber pressure (thrust).

Propellant Storage for Space Missions

As previously mentioned, storage of propellants for space-system propulsion represents an important de sign area. Cryogenic propellants require protection against high temperatures, particularly over long stor age periods. Earth-storable propellants, by contrast, require protection against low temperature, because of the danger of freezing. There are two basic design approaches to propellant storage for space missions, vented and nonvented. Selection of the opt imum system design depends on mission, propellant type, and type of engine feed system.

In a vented storage system, mainly used for cryogenic propellants, the pressure and temperature of the propellant are maintained at a constant value, any heat input being absorbed by allowing a small boiloff. Since conditions will vary widely during travel, the net heat input to each propellant tank may be computed by numerical integration for the spe cific vehicle path, such as a complete orbit. This path can be divided into a number of intervals, and the equilibrium skin temperatures and net heat fluxes
(considering both internal and external sources) to propellant tanks determined for each orbit position. By algebraically adding the net heat inputs for each, the net heat input rate for one complete orbit can then be obtained and the amount of propellant boiloff per orbit calculated.

384 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

In a system without venting, heat input causes propellant  temperature rise and a corresponding increase in vapor pressure. This system can be applied to both cryogenic and earth-storable pro pellants.  The a l lowable  pressure  rise, and consequent ly  the maximum heat input, will be dictated by the allowable tank pressure. In this case, the storage analysis assumes an allowable vapor pressure rise during the mission, based on initial conditions. This permits determination of the final propellant temperature, expected changes in propel lant density and ullage-volume requirements, and pressure-dependent  propellant tank weights. For cryogenics, insulation is usually provided to limit heat input. For earth storables, insulation may be needed either to limit heat input or heat loss (to avoid freezing the propellants).

11.4 DESIGN OF REACTION-CONTROL ENGINE SYSTEMS

Spacecraft Attitude Control  Requirements

Spacecraft attitude control requires application of torques about the three axes (yaw, pitch, and roll)
passing through the vehicle's center of mass. The problem of attitude control implies rotation and/or stabilization of the vehicle about  these axes. Its operation consists of two main phases:

 Rotation of the vehicle over a given angle, within a specified time.

 Stabilization of the vehicle in a required position, within acceptable tolerance limits.

The position of a vehicle, if left uncontrolled, may not be the one required for efficient use of its main propulsion system. For example, a spacecraft may have to perform a series of trajectory correction maneuvers, for which it must be oriented properly. Or during separation from the launch vehicle the spacecraft may gain unwanted momentum and thus need correction for proper orientation.

Ideally, a spacecraft oriented at some attitude should remain so indefinitely; but being continuously subjected to small external and internal forces, it will drift off the desired position. An attitude-control system, either continuous or on-off, must counteract all disturbing torques. Practical considerations tend to favor the on-off operation. The attitude-control system itself contains certain nonlinearities and nonideal conditions. In actual operation these in herent nonlinearities cause the vehicle to settle into a periodic motion about a reference po in t - - r ep  resented by a closed curve in the phase-plane and termed the "limit cycle of operation."

The problem of attitude control, then, becomes twofold:

1) What will rotate the vehicle through a given angle to some new attitude?

2) What will maintain the vehicle in this attitude?
The energy for these two basic maneuvers can be calculated, and total attitude-control requirements for any space mission can be computed,  by simply determining the total number of times these two ma neuvers occur.

Of the various att i tude-control systems, the reaction systems have proven the most versatile, and provide a wide range of torque, up to high levels. They have been universally applied to manned spacecraft and in large unmanned vehicles.

RCS Operational Modes

In any reaction control system (RCS) the amount of thrust delivered on command must be very precisely controlled to avoid overshoot or undershoot  and hunting. Three basic operat ional  modes  are available:

 O n - a n d - o f f  ( " b a n g - b a n g " )  con t ro l .  This
"multiple-start" system operates intermittently as long as necessary at its rated thrust level. If the on-and-off command signals are given as a function of sensed position error only, the system would tend to be unstable because of the time lags that are present in all real systems. This situation can be corrected through the use of control systems that use both position error and rate of error change to time the on and off command signals.

 P r o p o r t i o n a l  control .  The RCS operating thrust will be varied according to the error signals.

 Repeti t ive-pulse control. This type of control needs only position-error sensing. It uses a system that delivers thrust in a continuous series of ac curately reproduc ib le  impulse  bits to assure orientation and stabilization of the vehicle. The op timum thrust pulse-outline should be a square wave. Control may be achieved by modulating pulse width or the frequency of a fixed pulse width, or by a combination of these.

RCS Engine Selection

Liquid monopropellants and bipropellants both have been used for reaction-control engines. Selection of an optimum system for a given mission primarily depends  on total system weight (including pro pellants) vs. total impulse. As mission time increases, so does the propellant and tankage portion of the total system weight, while the weight of nozzles, valves, and plumbing remains fixed. A comparison of two reaction-control systems of different fixed weight and specific impulse may show the lower fixed-weight system to have an overall weight advan tage despite a considerably lower specific impulse.

If total impulse is the variable and total system weight the evaluating criteria, a plot of total system weight vs. total impulse helps compare competitive systems. If thrust and number of restarts (operating cycles) are also factors, comparison will need more dimensions.  Based on the selection criteria of minimum total system weight, the three major factors to be considered as independent  variables for different space missions are total impulse, thrust level, and number of cycles. Selection of an RCS en gine largely depends on these three requirements, and reliability considerations.  Other important factors will be cost, pe r formance  tolerances, maximum impulse per cycle, space storage and environment, systems integration, and logistics.

Two explosive-actuated pres surant-start valves operate in parallel; likewise, two pressure regulators are used pilot-selected by a three way solenoid valve. In each propellant-pressurant line, a "quad" check-valve assembly ensures that propellants that may have permeated through the positive-expulsion bladders will not reverse-flow into the common pressurant line downstream of the pressure regulators. A similar "quad" check-valve assembly downstream of each propellant tank prevents reverse flow of propellants from the other propellant subsystem or from the main propulsion system.

Packaging and Installation of  RCS

As with the spacecraft's main propulsion, the control components of a reaction-control engine system can be packaged in modules. The modular packages may incorporate related control components within the same housing. Typical modular control packages for reaction-control systems are indicated schematically in Fig. 11-10.

Figure 11-11 presents the installation of the reaction-control engine systems used on a typical manned spacecraft, the Space Shuttle Orbiter. All systems are pressure-fed and use N204/MMH pro pellants. The tasks of the Orbiter's reaction-control system include attitude control in orbit and during reentry and small translational maneuvers. In the event of OMS failure, the RCS thrusters can also be used for the OMS burns.

The Orbiter's reaction-control engine systems comprise thirty-eight 870-1b-thrust primary thrusters,
14 forward and 12 in each of the rear pods, and six
24-1b-thrust vernier thrusters, two forward and two in each of the rear pods. The forward RCS module and the aft RCS pods each have five propellant manifolds to provide redundancy.

Design of RCS Thrust Chambers

For systems using hypergolic earth-storable bipro pellants, reaction-control  thrust chambers  are generally cooled by some combination of ablative, radiation, or film cooling. The design and con struction principles for ablatively-cooled RCS thrust chambers do not basically differ from those for main propulsion systems; but the small physical sizes (1 100-1b thrust) and the operational modes (such as the pulse mode) of reaction-control thrust chambers require some special considerations.

For example, a typical thrust chamber with a thrust level of 1 lb and a chamber pressure of 100
psia would have a throat diameter of less than 0.1 in. This throat diameter must be produced accurately and remain unaffected by erosion during firing. Generally, in small ablative rocket motors, the internal geometry remains essentially unchanged as ablation progresses. The thermal protection in this case, provided by the internal change from the py rolysis or decomposition of the plastic resin, yields a porous char layer without any significant di mensional changes. The transition zone between the virgin ablative and the char is referred to as the
"char front." The ablation rate, in this case, would not be governed by a surface regression, but rather by a regression of the interface between the virgin ablative and the char. For highest accuracy, however,

11-12 that soakback usually consumes a large percentage of virgin ablative and does not contribute to the useful firing time. Even though some char preheating time will be gained during the subsequent firing, that will hardly compensate for the loss of burn time compared to what would have been available had the chamber been fired continuously. In this respect, it is desirable to minimize the number of soakbacks, particularly toward the last portion of the virgin ablative.

Combinations of repetitive pulsings and multiple starts can be treated in the same manner  as described above, except that the "on" cycles com posed of repetitive pulsings will effect a different gradient of the ablation curve, based on the particular percent-burn value, instead of the contin uous-firing (100%) curve.

388 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

Total radiation cooling applied to RCS thrust chambers may pose the following problems:

 Difficulties with inboard installation of the thrust chamber.

 Thermal-shielding requirements  for compo nents surrounding the thrust chamber.

 Recrystallization of the chamber construction metals in multiple-start applications.

 Need for a larger thrust chamber ,  when operated at a relatively low chamber pressure.

If properly designed and applied, however, a radiation-cooled thrust chamber probably will prove the simplest, lightest, and relatively most reliable.

The radiation-cooled Space Shuttle Orbiter RCS vernier engine (manufactured by the Marquardt Co.)
shown in Fig. 11-13 has a combustion chamber made of columbium with a columbium disilicide coating to prevent oxidation. The nozzle is scarfed to match the external contour of the forward RCS module and the rear RCS pods; and the engine has been insulated to protect the Orbiter structure from the 2000-2400F temperatures. The injector has a single pair of fuel and oxidizer holes canted to cause impingement of the two streams. Each engine has a 10-W heater to maintain injector temperatures within an acceptable operating range. Solenoid-operated poppet  valves are used for both the fuel and oxidizer.

Design of  RC$ Control Components

The various aspects of RCS control-component design are similar to those for spacecraft main propuls ion systems, except  that propellant  and pressurant have much lower flowrates. For instance, the propellant flowrate of a thrust chamber may be as low as 0.004 lb/s to produce a thrust of 1.0 lb. Besides the propellant- injector valves, all other control components ,  such as pressure regulators, check valves, and vent valves, are similar to those of other systems.

In addition to high reliability and suitability for the space environment, the RCS injector propellant valves need fast and precise response when opening or closing, tight shutoff, with no leakage, and low power consumption.

The importance of rocket vehicle propulsion system weight to the achievement of the required velocity increment with a given payload wieght is presented in this appendix.

As was seen with residual propellants, excessive dead weight at burnout imposes penalties. Whenever rocket engines can be made lighter without compro mising reliability and structural integrity, the payoff in range and payload will therefore be sizable. Engine and vehicle builders usually distinguish sev eral types of engine weight:

Dry weight. The net weight of the engine as it leaves the factory.

Burnout weight. Engine dry weight plus residual, measurable propellants remaining in the engine at cutoff. In a typical engine design, burnout weight may be 4% higher than dry weight. Burnout weight plays importantly in vehicle mass ratio (Eq. 1-30).

Wet weight. The engine dry weight plus all pro pellant within it, during main stage. In a typical design, engine wet weight may be 6% higher than dry weight. Wet weight significantly affects vehicle in flight center of gravity and moments of inertia.

Wet gimballed weight. This portion of wet weight represents engine mass gimballed for steering purposes. In earlier designs this meant essentially the thrust-chamber and injector wet-weight. In later designs it often refers to the entire engine less a rel atively small amount of stationary parts. This weight affects gimbal actuator loads and response char acteristics of the guidance control loop.

Ideally, dry weight and burnout weight should be equal; that is, no propellants should be trapped in the engine at shutdown. In practice, this will not al ways be possible. However, the engine designer can do much to bring it about through proper design, sizing and routing of lines, avoidance of traps, and location of valves.

Because of the importance of weight control, rocket-engine manufacturers employ "engineers specifically in charge of this area. Table A-1 shows a typical weight progress form, as used by the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International. It is revised and reissued periodically. Thus it becomes a useful tool to raise early warnings of a trend to overweight. The arbitrary example shows a slight underweight. However, the table also shows the data to be based almost entirely on estimated and cal culated figures, rather than on actual weighing results. This is characteristic for the earlier phases of design and development of a rocket engine. More often than not, the weight advantage will disappear gradually as the design firms up; then the squeeze will be on. For convenient display of the weight tenden cies over time, a graph like Fig. A-1 will be useful.

The weight changes of the various components as well as of the entire engine affect centers of gravity and moments of inertia. Through issue of a data sheet like Fig. A-2, all parties concerned can be kept informed on changes as they occur.

Note that the data presented in Table A-1 and Fig. A-1 and A-2 concern the 150,000-1b A-2 Stage engine system, a part of an assumed multistage space vehicle configuration.

Consider the influence of structural weight on the performance and gross takeoff weight of a rocket vehicle, and how its magnitude varies with the design parameters of different vehicle systems. The quan titative relationships will be evaluated individually for each case.

Equation (1-30) can be rewritten for the stage burnout velocity of a single-stage vehicle or the stage velocity increment of any individual stage of a multistage vehicle system, as follows:

APPENDIX A 39 1

For a given burnout velocity these equations show an even weight tradeoff between stage engine system weight and stage payload weight. The weight of all other items being kept constant, a pound decrease in the stage engine-system weight will increase the stage payload capacity by one pound.

For a fixed payload, and assuming other items except engine weight to be constant, the relation be tween the stage velocity increment Vbo and stage en gine-system weight for a given system can be written as follows:

k(~22 + Stage engine system weight'~
Vbo = klln + Stage engine system ~ )

(A-3)

where kl = Cvcg(Is)oa = constant k2 = Stage payload weight + Stage residual-pro pellant weight at burnout + Stage structure, guidance and other weight = constant k 3 = Stage usable-propellant weight + k2 = con stant

Since k2 < k 3, the denominator will decrease more rapidly than the numerator, with decreasing engine weight. Thus fixed payloads increase burnout ve locity, which will pay off in longer range or higher orbit.

For a given burnout velocity and for a fixed payload, the required Stage average overall specific impulse (Is)oa in terms of Stage engine-system weight can be established as follows:

(k 3 + System engine system weight'~
(Is)oa = k4/ln ~ k2 + St-~ge ~ sys---~-emem ~ )

(A-4)

where-- Vbo k4 - Cvcg - constant

Equation (A-4) shows that the overall-specific-im pulse requirements decrease with decreasing engine system weight.

The "growth factor" of a rocket vehicle also il lustrates the importance of weight. If the weight of a component increases, for instance, the designer can adjust for this by increasing the propellant load and thus possibly that of other components, such as a pump, to maintain the same required vehicle per formance--i.e. ,  payload and vehicle trajectory. If one part of the vehicle system exceeds its weight allotment by one pound, the total vehicle system weight at takeoff will see a certain number of ad ditional pounds. Growth factor is defined as the total vehicle-system (including payload) weight increase at takeoff divided by the causal increment of added inert and/or payload weight. Growth factor for a given vehicle system will not be a precise value, but rather vary within a band. For instance, a small weight increase of a component in an existing system may only require the addition of a corresponding small amount of propellant, but not require enlarge ment of the tanks, valves, etc.; then the growth factor will be small. In another case, the weight increase may be "the straw that breaks the camel's back," re quiring the use of the next-larger valve, duct, or the like; the growth factor will then be large.

In general, growth factor gives the designer a useful tool during the early steps to an engine system, because it attaches a tangible value to the importance of the engine-system weight. A systems-weight in crease may be considered "uninvited payload." For single-stage vehicles, and relatively small weight changes, the value of the growth factor then can be expressed with sufficient accuracy as follows:

Total vehicle system Growth factor = weight at takeoff

Payload weight (A-5)

For any stage of a multistage vehicle, the approx imate value of the growth factors against total ve hicle-system weight at takeoff can be expressed as follows:

Growth factor =

Total vehicle system weight at takeoff

Stage payload weight (A-6)

The growth factors of any stage against the vehicle system weight at ignition of the same or lower stage can be expressed as follows:

Vehicle system weight at same or lower stage ignition Growth factor = (A-7)

Stage payload weight

Sample Calculation

A three-stage rocket has the following weight data:
total vehicle-system weight at takeoff, 40,000 lb.;
vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition, 7500
lb; vehicle system at third-stage ignition, 2200 lb;
payload weight, 700 lb.

P r o b l e m

For each pound increase of engine-system weight of first, second, and third stages, respectively, determine
(at a constant vehicle performance) (a)  increases of total vehicle-system weight at takeoff, and ( b )
increases of vehicle-system weight at second- and third-stage ignition.

Solution:

(a) Payload weight of first stage = vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition = 7500 lb; pay load weight of second stage = vehicle-system weight at third-stage ignition = 2200 lb; payload weight of third stage = actual system payload weight -- 700 lb.



392 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

From Eq. (A-6):

1) Growth factor of first stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
m

First-stage payload weight 7,500 - 5.86

2) Growth factor of second stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
Second-stage payload weight - 2,200 - 2 0

3) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
Third-stage payload weight - 700 - 62.9

Therefore.

1) For each pound increase of first-stage engine system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 5.86 lb.

2) For each pound increase of second-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 20 lb.

3) For each pound increase of third-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 62.9 lb.

Co) Note that the weight growth of lower stages will not affect the upper-stage weight growth. For an increase of first-stage vehicle-system weight, there will be no weight changes on second and third stages; and for an increase on second stage vehicle system weight, no weight change will be required for the third stage. From Eq.
(a-7)"

1) Growth factor vehicle-system ignition:

of second stage against weight  at second-stage

Vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition 7,500

Second-stage payload weight 2,200 - ~ =  3 . 4 1

2) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition:

Vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition 7,500

m

Third-stage payload weight 700 - 10.72

3) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system weight at third-stage ignition:

Vehicle system weight at third-stage ignition 2,200

Third-stage payload weight 700 - 3 . 1 4

Therefore.

1) For each pound increase of second-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition will be 3.41 lb.

2), 3) For each pound increase of third-stage engine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition will be 10.72 lb and the increase on vehicle-system weight at third-stage ignition will be 3.14 lb.

The correctness of results can be checked by recombining the individual stage growth factors to obtain the growth factor for the entire vehicle system:

3.14 x 3.41 x 5.86 = 62.9



Appendix B

Reliability Considerat ions

The effort to increase reliability in rocket engines should span the entire program spectrum from con ceptual design through production. The reliability ef fort can basically be split into three parts: preven tion of failures, process assessment and control, and monitoring of performance. Reliability through pre vention involves early involvement of reliability en gineers in "concurrent engineering" design and de velopment loops to identify high-risk devices and de signs and catastrophic failure modes. Both before and during fabrication and fielding of hardware, po tential process faults and their effects should be eval uated and controlled to assure expected reliability performance through a "Continuous Process Im p rovement  (CPI)" approach.  The cont inuous monitoring of performance needs to be organized in a formal way (e.g., Reliability Growth or Reliability Demonstration Test Monitoring) to assure identifica tion and correction of possible faults.

Reliability in Design

The reliability contribution to a concurrent engineer ing effort should be through assessment of past per formance of similar-type hardware to identify high failure-risk components or approaches in the pro posed designs, conducting reliability-optimization trade studies, and correlating past "lessons learned"
in rocket-engine-specific systems. Potential process inadequacies should be addressed, with considera tion for control of a process or designing in "fault tolerance." For example, process-induced contam ination may be a problem largely solvable by en largement of flow passages in the engine systems.

Another aspect of reliability in design, so-called
"simplicity," usually will contribute significantly to higher reliability. Parts which do not fulfill a truly useful purpose should be omitted; this may include many so-called safety features and interlocking de vices, which often cause more trouble than they pre vent. Early designs of liquid-propellant rocket en gines indeed often suffered from an overdose of so phistication and safety devices. Many of the more recent designs have been substantially improved in this area. Simplifications, like all other design fea tures, must be carefully planned and evaluated. Simplification by elimination of a useful component must not become an excuse for failure to improve that component if its absence could severely penalize other subsystems or maintenance and servicing pro cedures.

The counterpoint to simplicity will be redun dancy. Occasionally, the reliability of certain types of parts are inherently too low or the consequences of the failure effect are too great to accept. Then a redundant  functional architecture may be consid er_ed, in which complexity, in terms of more parts, will be increased to achieve a higher reliability. The additional cost, weight, and failure modes must be

393

weighed against the reduction in probability of the failure mode of concern. Man-rated systems typi cally have the additional requirement to isolate phys ically the redundant element from its sister element to assure protection from common causes of failure
(e.g., contamination, heat, vibration, explosion, etc.). Additionally, the operational status of each element of the redundancy may have to be monitored to as sure its existence before flight.

For instance, to avoid a troublesome sealed con nection it may be decided to omit flanges and seals and to weld it. However, if one of the lines thus con nected were inadvertently pinched in the field, it would be necessary to remove the entire engine from the vehicle under preparation for launchmmagnify ing a simple replacement into a major operation. To be sure, welding or preferably brazing may indeed be the best solution for many problem connections. The point is, this will not be true for all connections. The design team must carefully analyze all aspects of the system including handling and, in particular, mis handling by the user.

As another example, tests may have shown that an engine could readily be set up and calibrated to specifications by means of orifices, eliminating pre viously used regulators. Engines get delivered ac cordingly. With rocket engines, it is entirely normal that many months,' if not several years, may elapse between delivery and final use. Much can happen during this period. Changes in mission plans, for in stance, may have made another thrust level more de sirable. Then, suddenly, an adjustment by means of orifices, in particular its verification, becomes a ma jor operation. Omission of a strategic regulator was indeed an engine simplification, but for the vehicle system it turned out to be a complication. The point, again: careful evaluation of a planned omission must consider all aspects, including changes of plans.

Reliability Assurance

The emphasis on reliability must not become an empty slogan. Fortunately, the rocket-engine de signer has certain means to achieve the highest de gree of reliability. One of these is an effective
"failure report ing and corrective action system
(FRACAS)" during the monitoring of hardware test activities. Testing of all hardware should be moni tored in an organized and regimented fashion to as sure identification and resolution of hardware design and processing failures. The design~ should, at the very least, implement a fundamental FRACAS loop. This may be supplemented with a "reliability growth"
assessment program to appraise regularly the pro gress of the engine system toward the expected reliability performance. In many cases, a "reliability demonstration" test program may be proposed to determine, with "confidence," the final reliability per formance of the engine system.



394 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

D e f i n i t i o n s

The definitions used in rocket-engine reliability pro grams vary widely with individual program require ments, with the object under design and develop ment, and with the missions contemplated. The def initions given below typify usage in actual rocket en gine programs, and can be readily adapted to others. For the sake of clarity, irrelevant jargon and detail have been omitted.

Reliability. The probability that a part or sys tem will function properly and, if necessary, repeat edly under  rated operating conditions, within the specified load and time limits.

Mission success. Completion of the rocket-en gine mission objectives within specified tolerances. All subsystems contribute to the success. It is an in herent characteristic of mission-success analysis and assurance that they anticipate the probability of cer tain part and subsystem malfunctions, offsetting them with appropriate countermeasures (such as redun dancies, emergency power sources, power and pro pellant reserves, etc.).

Mission failure. Failure of the rocket engine to produce the required thrust for the specified time to complete the mission objectives. Mission failures can be classified as catastrophic, premature shut down, and "deferred."

Catas t roph ic  f a i l u r e  (Cri t ical i ty  I ) .  An
"uncontained" failure in which the effects propagate beyond the physical envelope of the engine system, with sufficient energy potential likely to propagate failure to adjacent systems. It is important to assess and discriminate this type of failure from a prema ture shutdown for crew safety in manned vehicles and for mission success in multi-engine unmanned vehi cles (if engine out is a viable mode of operation).

Premature  shutdown (Criticality 11). A fail ure in which the effects are contained and degrade performance enough to trigger an engine shutdown. In multi-engined vehicles with "engine-out" capa bility, the discrimination between catastrophic failure and premature shutdown figures importantly in the criteria for vehicle mission success.

Deferred  fa i lure  (Criticality III). A failure causing generally slow-acting and minor perfor mance degradation in which continued operation of the engine is a consideration. Action to cope with the failure will be deferred to allow analysis by the pi lot or an automatic logic, to decide whether correc tive action can be taken or an abort sequence should

be initiated. Typical example: shutting off an engine in a four-engine airplane and reaching destination safely, although with a delay. Analogous provisions are anticipated for manned rockets.

Man-rating. Design and operational provisions to assure crew survival even in case of mission failure. Thus, man-rated crew reliability typically exceeds mission reliability. For instance, overall vehicle reli ability to achieve mission success may be 95%. By the addition of an escape mechanism, man-rated re liability may be increased to 99.5%. Caution is ad vised not to become entirely "wrapped up" in man rating at the expense of mission reliability. A single launch of a man-carrying space vehicle costs several hundred million dollars, all told. Investment in means to save the mission as well as the man, there fore, appears to be prudent. Table B-1 illustrates this clearly. Pressing optimum reliability for spacecraft and launch vehicle, including the engines, therefore minimizes the need for a crew-escape system.

Engine out.  Design and operational provisions in a multi-engine system to permit limited or com plete mission continuance in case one engine fails to fire or malfunctions and gets shut down. This option can notably improve system reliability since one of the engines is a redundant element.

Failure mode. The specific manner in which a part or system malfunctions. This may be a "short"
or "open" circuit, an incorrectly "closed" or "open"
valve, an engine out, or similar malfunction.

Order o f  failure. The number  of components in a system that would have to fail, regardless of their failure mode, to cause a system or mission failure. First-order failures derive from malfunction of a sin gle component  or part (i.e., "single-point" failure). Second- and higher-order failures are defined in a like manner. Typical example: a stuck pressurizing valve causing overpressure in a vessel would rupture it only if the safety valve failed to open; this would be second-order failure. However, continuous venting of a properly opening vent valve may prematurely de plete the gas supply. A thorough failure-effect analy sis will reveal all ramifications. In the example, de pletion would not occur instantaneously; this would be "deferred" failure. The designer can do some thing about it in advance, such as by giving the pilot an overriding closing valve that remains completely inactive when not needed (al though--not  a complete blessingmthis adds weight).

Failure modes and effects analysis. An or derly, hardware-based analysis listing all credible modes in which components or parts of a system can fail, the effects of the failures on the engine's or vehi cle's ability to complete the mission, and the order of the failures. Such an analysis should distinguish between the prelaunch, launch, and cutoff phases. All identified failure modes should be classified as catas trophic, premature shutdown, or "deferred." This hardware-to-effect approach assures that all notable pieces of hardware will be addressed and assessed.

Fault-tree analysis. An event-based analysis that targets specific failure-effect scenarios and then lists all the hardware malfunctions in a graphical, hi erarchical "tree" (a reverse of the hardware-to-effect approach of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis).



APPENDIX B 395

Emergency detection system (EDS). T h e EDS comprises the electromechanical devices, in cluding sensors and discriminators, to detect an im minent malfunction. Depending on the type of fail ure  ( ca t a s t roph ic ,  p r e m a t u r e  s h u t d o w n ,  or
"deferred"), it may initiate immediate action, or defer but store and/or  display it in a suitable manner
(timer, visual gage, or light). Inputs to the EDS must be analyzed, selected, and provided by the designer
(in particular, the engine designer) at the outset.

Noncomplex redundancy. The simultaneous function of identical equipment.  Application de pends upon the particular failure mode to be elimi nated. For a typical example, see Fig. B-1 and B-2. Other examples include dual (series) seals and paral lel valves.

Complex redundancy. The original function carried out by one component. Failure sensors, logic circuits, and switching devices energize an identical standby component,  when needed. The advantages obtained can be completely offset by the additional complexity of sensing and switching circuitry. The potential problem area may be merely shifted from the equipment to the failure-detection components. However, this standby redundancy may be advanta geous for long mission times (e.g., days or weeks)
where it may be undesirable also to subject the backup equipment to prolonged operation. A typical example: electric-power emergency battery with volt age sensor and switchover circuitry.

Failure Modes of Engine Components

Failure of a rocket-engine component  may be at tributed to basically three causes: functional, struc tural, and process faults. They have the following principal modes: functional failures, fatigue failures, overstress and overstrain, failures pertaining to com bustion devices, failures pertaining to electrical devices, manufacturing and material defects, unex plained failures, human error, and manufacturing of field-processing faults.

Functional failures. Something other than structural failure can cause malfunction of parts or components.  For instance, an "0" ring may fail to seal due to improper groove depth specified in the design; or a plunger may freeze in the bore of a guid ing bushing, because of improper  surface finish and/or  noncompatibility of materials. The following precautions will minimize possible function failures in the design of engine components:

 Choose proven designs with an established service record.

 Use standard mechanical elements (bolts, nuts, threads, gears, pins, rivets, springs, seals, tube fittings, pistons, keys, shafts, bearings) wherever possible.

 Select simple designs, but without impairing flexibility. In particular, minimize the number of moving parts and sealing surfaces.

 Allow adequate functional margins in the de sign of components (spring forces, actuating powers, supply of lubricants, supply of coolants).

 Subject newly designed parts to extensive func tional testing, under simulated working and environ mental conditions, before "freezing" the final config uration.

 Provide redundancy, a "buddy plan": where one component would be sufficient, provide two of the same type. If one fails, the other takes over. This can be achieved in two ways: by noncomplex and by complex redundancy. Intelligently applied, redun dancy can significantly increase reliability.

 Pursue a rigorous program of continuous product improvement.

Fatigue failures. Fatigue failures are fractures caused by repeated loading at stresses considerably lower than those causing failure by a single load. They are the most common type of mechanical fail ure. The ability of a part to resist fatigue failure can not be checked without destroying the part. Checking is possible, however, through destructive endurance tests with representative samples selected at random.

Most fatigue failures start with a crack at or near an outside surface because stresses are apt to be greatest there. The actual failure will result from gradual propagation of these cracks.

The starting point for a crack will depend upon the geometry of the part and on surface conditions. Any notch or other stress-raiser, being a point of high stress concentration, may start fatigue cracks. Fillet radii too small, threads, oil holes, keyways and similar surface irregularities all present  po ten t i a l sources of fatigue failure. Although a part may be de signed to be free of geometric irregularities, having no shoulders, grooves or the like, it may still contain a great number of minute stress-raisersmtool marks, scratches, identification stamp marks, or various in herent discontinuities in the material itself, such as inclusions of foreign matter and quenching cracks.

The design engineer should make every effort to avoid stress concentrations in a highly stressed part subject to repeated loads. In the design, rigid speci fications should be called out for surface finishes. To carry repeated loads, forgings are usually preferable to castings, and ductile materials to material prone to become brittle. Welded joints see almost every type of stress concentration and fatigue failure. Wherever



396 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES possible, welded joints should be minimized in the design of parts subject to repeated loads. Rigid pro cedures for welding and inspection must be called out in the design.

O v e r s t r e s s  a n d  overs t ra in .  Stress analysis in mechanical design to prevent overstress and over strain was discussed in section 2.5.3. The interrela tionship of stress and reliability of mechanical parts
(as illustrated simplistically in Fig. B-3) can be evalu ated probabilistically.

Two stress levels exist for every part in a given engine component: the working stress and the dam aging stress at which failure occurs. The failure may be either a fracture or a deformation beyond allow able tolerances. Either will be a mean value of a dis tribution about a mean. The difference between the working and the damaging stress mean values indi cates the stress reliability margin of the part.

Deviations from the mean working stress mainly reflect variations in the dimensions of the part and operational and environmental conditions. The dis tribution about the mean damaging stress results from variations in material properties, fabrication processes, quality control, and maintenance prac tices. The area Pf, where the two distributions over lap, represents the probabil i ty of failure (unre liability).

Close control of functional and environmental loads may decrease the variation of the working stress about the mean. Likewise, better materials and strict quality control should increase the damaging stress mean value and decrease the variation about the mean. Thus, the area of overlap may be substan tially reduced or el iminated,  and reliability in creased.

Failure o f  combust ion  dev ices .  Under steady state operating conditions, combustion devices in liquid-propellant rocket engines must withstand hot gases- - tempera tures  ranging from 1000 to 6000F. The walls of these devices either are made from high temperature-resist ing (refractory) materials or are cooled by heat-absorbtion, ablation, and propellant film and/or  regenerative effects. Structural failure may occur because of erosion from wall temperatures z z

Under certain transient or unstable conditions, such as engine start or stop, combustion instability or abrupt pressure surges may cause a failure; see Chapter 4, "Design of Thrust Chambers and Other Combustion Devices."

Elec t r ica l  f a i l u r e s .  Although predominant ly an assembly of mechanical parts, a modern rocket engine employs a number of electrical devices with out which it cannot function reliably. Electrical components used most widely include power sources
(batteries), converters (dc to ac), microprocessors, tranducers, wires and harnesses, connectors, switches, relays (electromechanical  and solid-state), timers, pressure switches, diodes, solenoid valves, servomo tors, and position indicators.

All of these devices represent, to some degree, a potential source of failure, the consequences of which can be just as detrimental as failure of mechanical parts. By proper design and assembly instructions, by careful select ion of the elements,  and by Environmental Stress Screening (ESS), the designer can forestall electrical failures and thus assure overall system reliability. Common points of electrical fail ure include the following:

 Cold-solder spots in connectors, wirings, and electrical elements. They often cause sporadic dis continuities, particularly under vibration.

 Short circuits in wirings, connectors, and other electrical devices. This may be due to poor design, leaving insufficient separation between connector pins, lugs, and the like; or to excessive solder; or damaged insulation due to poor harness installation, chafing under vibration, and poor handling; or over load and/or  overheating in solenoids, moisture in connectors, etc.

 Fused relay contacts, due to overload and/or incorrect current rating of the elements.

 Relay and switch contact-loss under vibration. This is really an electromechanical malfunction. It can be prevented by proper relay selection, shock mounting, orientation of installation, or replacement by solid-state circuitry.

 Power failure resulting from one or more of the causes listed above. Preventions include emer gency batteries and overload switches, combined with subcircuit isolation through diodes.

A liquid-propellant rocket engine usually includes additional electrical elements as required for instru mentat ion and te lemetry-- ins t rumenta t ion  power supplies, end organs (sensors, pickups, thermocou pies, accelerometers ,  position indicators), signal conditioners (analog-to-digital), wiring, and the like. Although, as a rule, instrumentation does not directly effect proper functioning of the engine system, its failure may indirectly cause engine malfunction, by interfering with its operation. For instance, a pres sure pickup may rupture and cause premature deple tion of a gas supply; the same event in the fuel system may cause an engine-compartment fire; improper in stallation of a thermocouple may block a vital lubri cant or other line.



APPENDIX B 397

The engine designer's task includes engine in strumentation. It is obvious that this peripheral sys tem, too, will require his full attention.

Manufacturing and material  defects. The producibility of parts directly affects the reliability of components. Manufacturing and material defects can be prevented only by strict process and quality control. The areas of quality control may be subdi vided as follows:

 Materials inspection.  The extent of inspec tion and testing of raw materials depends upon the nature of the part for which they will be used. Inspection of materials includes testing for composi tion, uniformity, mechanical properties, fabrication and heat-treating characteristics, and possibly other properties, as the application may demand.

 Traceability. By the time a materials defect is detected, many more parts may have been made from the same lot or batch of raw material. If accu rate records have been kept on parts for which num bered material lots have been used, it will be possi ble, without a "panic," to withdraw and replace all parts made from the faulty lot. The importance of accurate and complete records is obvious.

 Process inspection. This refers to all shop in spections made of parts as they are being processed. It in effect checks the performance of the operators and tools or equipment, and sorts out faulty parts as soon as errors are detected.

 Salvage. Someone decides whether defective materials or parts can be corrected or must be scrapped.

 Final inspection. This inspection covers the completed component  parts to ensure they come within the limits required by the design.

 Checking o f  ac tual  service performance.  This includes investigation of complaints and studies of actual service performance of the part in the engine system (see "Failure-Reporting System").

R e l i a b i l i t y  d e m o n s t r a t i o n .  This is a strict, re liability test series in which the "matured" engine sys tem configuration is repeatedly tested in the same configuration and mission cycle. The primary objec tive is to statistically determine the reliability per formance level and confidence limits for the engine configuration.

R e l i a b i l i t y - g r o w t h  m o n i t o r i n g .  This is typi cally a monitoring and assessment task over engi neering development  test programs to continually assess the development (i.e., "growth") in the reliabil ity performance of an engine system. Early successes and failures are plotted to continually check for the expected improvements through corrective actions and process improvements.

H u m a n  error. Experience with early manned rocket flights showed that certain functions could be performed better by trained men than by automatic devices. It appears certain that future spaceflight will employ combinations of automatic and manual sys tems, the ratio of the two depending on mission re quirements. Even unmanned missions, ostensibly fully automatic, have people directly involved during launch preparations and through postlaunch com mands for trajectory-correction maneuvers, informa tion playback, and similar actions.

As recent nuclear powerplant catastrophes attest, even a fully trained, possible very alert individual can be subject to error. He may commit an error at a desk while using a computer, or while connecting a number of hydraulic lines, or under stress while push ing buttons. The history of rocketry ~ is full of glaring examples. Whenever it happens, the most eloquent regrets are probably voiced by the designers of the system involved: If someone had not done some thing to their perfect creation, it would have worked faultlessly. The reaction is understandable,  but wrong.

For whatever reason a system failed, it obviously was not perfect. Its designer did not consider human nature, non-ideal operating conditions, or emergency situations. Clear and complete drawings, specifica tions, and other written instructions are important, but they will not prevent, by themselves, human er rors, because they can be misplaced, misread, or not read at all.

It is not surprising that the elimination of human error, or more positively, the perfection of the inte gration of man with the machine, is becoming an in dependent branch of engineering. It would be be yond the scope of this book to go into the details of
"Human Engineering" or "Human Factors Analysis."
Simply by applying mostly known methods and common sense, the rocket-engine designer can do much to prevent human error by the design of his parts and by mandatory actions during their build ing, checking, and handling. The following are only typical examples of a probably infinite number  of ways to prevent human error by design:

 Clear marking of bolts, lines, connectors, wires.
 Use of dissimilar connectors ,  dissimilar threads, a variety of keyways, etc. to make incorrect electrical and mechanical connections impossible.

 Safety wiring, electrical and mechanical inter locks.

 Painting bright red and/or  attaching bright red streamers to auxiliary devices that must be re moved before operation.

 Storing of components and systems that have successfully passed all inspections and checkouts in locked, controlled-storage rooms.

 Simulated, mock opera t ions~with  intentional attempts at improper handling, assembly, checkout, and operation of components and sys tems~to  assist
"foolproofing" during development.

None of these and numerous similar steps will eliminate human errors. However, they will substan tially reduce the likelihood of them and thus con tribute to overall reliability.

Design Reviews for Reliability

The reliability of a rocket engine and its components depends on many factors. A concurrent engineering approach topped with periodic design reviews can bulwark reliability. In practice, a design review, the progressive evaluation of a design, starts with the pre liminary schematics, layouts, and specifications and extends through the release of all final drawings. Those conducting reliability design reviews should include reliability specialists, design engineers, de


398 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES velopment, test, and service engineers, and various specialists for structures, materials, manufacturing, and quality control. A minimum of three design re views should be made for each design:

1) Preliminary design review. This is a prelim inary review of work statements, basic concepts, schematics, layouts, and analyses. It determines de velopment needs and results in decisions for the next design phases. This review should uncover misappli cations, critical areas and marginal designs at an early stage, when changes can be effected without dif ficulty.

2) Critical design review. This is the most im portant review for decisions and approvals. It in cludes formal review of all reliability aspects of lay outs, analyses, planned development tests, and pro curement specifications.

3) Final design review. This is the final review of overall design layouts, detail and assembly draw ings, analyses, process specifications, and R&D test results, before production release.

The reviews should emphasize the following points: structural integrity, function and performance, customer (vehicle) connections and envelope, mate rials compatibility and component  interfaces, pro ducibility and cost, reliability and repeatability, mal function effects, environment  and servicing, and
"special" requirements. It is highly recommended that the agreed-to layout bear the approval signatures of the groups involved.

A reliability checklist tailored to the individual designs may be used as a guide during the various design-review phases. The "Design Check-Off Sheet"
shown in section 2.5 may serve this purpose.

Design reviews are valuable and cost-saving tools for improving reliability. A group well organized and staffed will assure a meaningful review and instigate effective recommendations and actions. Complete documentation of all review details will provide valu able data for future reference.

Failures occur, from time to time, that cannot readily be isolated as having originated in a given component  or par t - -because  several causes were present simultaneously and could not tge separated, because instrumentation was inadequate, recording only the ultimate effects but not the cause, or because an incomplete investigation was conducted, perhaps in the hope it would not happen again.

Classification of a failure as "unexplained" should never be done as a matter of convenience, but rather only as a last resort if the most thorough investiga tion did not establish a clear cause. Complete and accurate records must be kept of the details associ ated with the failure. Through special statistical methods it may be possible to isolate the cause or causes at a later date. Also, special instrumentation may immediately be added in the areas of suspected but unproven causes. But the most sophisticated ex planation of a failure cannot transform it into a suc cess.

Under "Man-rating" the cost of a single launch was mentioned. Press releases give the cost of a ma jor space program as about 3.5 billion dollars a yea rml0  million a day! To save a mission, or just a single day of preparation, by improved reliability will quite clearly be worth the effort!

Likewise, the loss of a launch, or a day in the pro gram, is very costly indeed. The rocket-engine de signer must do everything he can to prevent either.



Appendix C

Rocket Engine Materials

Liquid propellant rocket engines utilize a wide range They are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking and of materials; from steel alloys to thermoplastics and hydrogen embrittlement and become quite brittle at composites. This appendix presents a brief dis- cryogenic temperatures. With the exception of 440C, cussion of a range of material types and their general martensitic stainless steels have limited usefulness on application in the design of liquid propellant rocket liquid propellant rocket engines. Being a high-car engines, bon alloy, 440C attains the highest hardness of the stainless steels. It is widely used for bearings and Plain-Carbon/Low-Alloy Steels other compressively loaded hardware requiring wear resistance.

Plain-carbon steels alloy iron and carbon. The low carbon grades (0.1-0.2%) have excellent ductility and toughness and are easily formed. The medium-car bon grades (0.3-0.5%) respond well to heat treatment, and thus provide a good combination of strength and toughness. The high-carbon grades (1.0-1.2%)
are hard and wear-resistant, but have poor toughness and ductility.

Low-alloy steels contain up to 2.0% alloying ele ment in addition to the iron and carbon. Adding al loying elements to steel increases hardenability (i.e., ability to harden through thick sections). Other im provements derived from alloy addition include im proved elevated-temperature properties, tough-hess, and corrosion resistance.

Plain-carbon and low-alloy steels are n o t  good candidates for rocket-engine hardware. Although in expensive, readily available, easy to fabricate, and typically high in strength, steels poorly resist atmo spheric corrosion and will rust in ambient environ ments unless protected. Also, they have a limited range of useful operating temperatures. Most steels become brittle below 0F and, on the high-tempera ture side, are limited by tempering temperature, which is usually below 1000F. Plain-carbon and al loy steels are susceptible to hydrogen-environment embrittlement, and are not resistant to stress-corro sion cracking in some heat-treat conditions.

Stainless Steels

In stainless steels--iron-carbon alloys with the addi Austen i t i c  s t a i n l e s s  s t ee l s  (300 series). The austenitic stainless steels all contain nickel in addi tion to the chromium. Nickel stabilizes austenite, normally a high-temperature phase, at room temper ature and below. Austenite differs from martensite in many respects. The nonmagnetic austenitic stainless steels are not heat-treatable, and cannot achieve the high strength of martensitic alloys. However, they possess good cryogenic toughness, good fabricability and weldability, excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to stress-corrosion cracking, and are com patible with oxygen and hydrogen. Relatively low cost, high availability, and good fabricability make austenitic stainless steels an excellent choice for rocket-engine components where strength-to-weight ratio is not a primary consideration.

Most austenitic stainless steels will be limited in usefulness by their low (30-ksi) room-temperature yield strength. Alloy 21-6-9, a nitrogen-strengthened modification, has about twice the yield strength at room temperature and three times the yield strength at -400F of 300-series stainless steel. It does not re quire heat treatment and possesses all of the other at tributes of austenitic stainless steels.

The corrosion resistance of all stainless steels can be severely diminished by denying access to a plentiful supply of oxygen. For this reason, any ap plication which results in close laying surfaces or crevices should be avoided. Multiply assemblies, such as bellows, are therefore not ideal applications for stainless steels.

Moreover, a carbide precipitation characterizes many austenitic stainless steels when heated in the

,1 ,1 tion of at least 12% chromium--the chromium pro- temperature range of 800-1600F. This sensitization vides a "passive" oxide film that protects the body reduces corrosion resistance. Not only is this a limi from most corrosive environments. This film must tation of application temperature, but also of pro be maintained to ensure corrosion protection, cesses which involve heating above 800F. The prob Oxygen shielding could cause deterioration of this lems of sensitization can be mitigated by utilizing passive film, rendering the steel "active"--having low-arbon grades (304L, 316L) or stabilized grades corrosion resistance and galvanic activity similar to (321,347) of austenitic stainless steels. those of low-alloy steels.

However, most of the PH stainless steels are martensitic, and as such are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking, hydrogen environment embrittlement, and loss of toughness at cryogenic temperatures.  An exception, A286, austenitic steel, possesses all of the attributes of the austenitic stainless steels coupled with high strength
(up to 200-ksi ultimate tensile strength in the cold worked condition). A286 has proven to be excep tionally suitable for fasteners, and has been used for nozzle tubing. Poor weldability limits wider applica tion of A286. JBK 75, a modification of A286, is not susceptible to weld cracking and therefore has appli cability for rocket-engine hardware.

Iron-Base SuperaIIoys

The iron-base low-expansion superalloys have exten sive application in liquid-propellant rocket engines because they provide high strength, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and resistance to hydrogen-envi ronment embrittlement (HEE). These iron-nickel cobalt alloys retain excellent properties from-423 to
1200F, are resistant to stress-corrosion cracking, and are readily weldable. However, lack of resistance to corrosion limits the use of them.

Incoloy 903 was the first of these alloys to find widespread application to structural components op erating in gaseous hydrogen or hydrogen-rich steam. It also can be used as an overlay to provide HEE pro tection to welds of non-HEE-resistant alloys. Incoloy
903 can be thermomechanically processed (TMP) for improved high-temperature stress-rupture properties.

Incoloy 907 offers~ better stress-rupture properties without requiring the TMP procedure. Incoloy 909
offers better low-cycle fatigue life and a simplified heat-treat cycle, which is compatible with that for Inconel 718. The weldability of Incoloy 907 has been rated higher than that of Incoloy 903, and Incoloy
909 has been shown to be the most weldable of the group.

Aluminum Alloys

Aluminum alloys are low in cost, easily fabricated, and readily available, but are limited in rocket-engine usage by maximum operating temperature. The high strength wrought alloys (i.e., 2024, 7075) are limited to
200-300F while the cast alloys such as Tens-50 and
356 can be used in the 300-400F range. The devel opment of aluminum-base-metal matrix composites has extended the operational limits of wrought alu minum alloys to the 800-900F range. However, lim ited availability, high cost, and difficulties in fabrica tion have been deterrents to the use of these com posites in rocket engines. All of the aluminum alloys are light in weight, resistant to hydrogen embrittle ment, and (most) have excellent cryogenic proper ties. Caution should be exercised with aluminum ap plications in oxygen systems because of low ignition temperature.

The casting alloys, low-strength wrought alloys, and moderate-strength 6061 are weldable. Corrosion resistance varies from excellent to fair; but in general the higher-strength alloys must be anodized for at mospheric-  and galvanic-corrosion protection. Anodizing forms an electrically insulating layer that could preclude electrical grounding.

Copper Alloys

Copper of course has high electrical and thermal conductivity, excellent corrosion resistance, and ease of fabrication, plus immunity to hydrogen-environ ment embrittlement. Alloying elements improve its strength, but generally at the expense of electrical and thermal conductivity. For example, 2% beryl lium can increase ultimate tensile strength of copper from 30 to 200 ksi; but the electrical conductivity of beryllium copper is only 20% of pure copper.

The more widely used copper alloys--brass
(copper and zinc), phosphor bronze (copper and tin), and beryllium copper (copper and beryl l ium) have strength increasing in the order listed.

The major application of copper alloys in rocket engines is for high-heat-flux applications, such as combustion chambers. Their high thermal conduc tivities minimize thermal gradients and resulting thermal stresses. Narloy A is a copper-silver alloy with thermal conductivity equivalent to pure copper, but with moderately high strength to 800F. Narloy-Z, with a zirconium addition, improves ductility and fa tigue life, and extends the operating range to 1000F. These alloys are available in the cast as well as wrought form. Copper alloys also serve as electrical conductors, conductive springs, and bearings and bushings.

Nickel-Base Alloys

Nickel-base alloys comprise some 65% of the weight of the Space Shuttle Main Engine. These alloys de rive their widespread usage in rocket engines from superior corrosion resistance, high-temperature oxi dation resistance, retention of useful properties over a wide temperature range, and, in many cases, very unique physical properties. The nickel-base alloys can be divided into three groups, based on applica tion.

The first group---nickel-base alloys used mainly for superior corrosion resistance--include Nickel 200, the monel alloys, Inconel 600, Inconel 625, and elec tro-deposited (ED) nickel. Inherently corrosion-re sistant, nickel does not depend upon a metastable passive film for protection; and, being strongly elec tronegative, it is not susceptible to galvanic corrosion when in contact with most other metals. Monels, al loys of nickel and copper, besides having good cor rosion resistance, have useful magnetic properties at cryogenic temperature and high resistance to igni tion in oxygen. The Inconel alloys, composed of nickel-chromium-iron, resist oxidation at tempera tures up to 1800F.

The second group, the nickel-base superalloys, re tain high strength at elevated temperatures. Alloy
718, the workhorse of this group, has high strength up to 1300F, good cryogenic ductility, and good weld ability. Fine-grained material should be specified for



APPENDIX C 401

parts to be electron-beam-welded. Higher-tempera ture applications exploit Rene' 41, Waspaloy, and MAR-M-246.

The third group, the special-application alloys, includes Nichrome (for electrical-resistance heating elements), chromel and alumel (for thermocouples), and Incoloys and Invar (for low-thermal-expansion applications).

All of the nickel-base alloys resist corrosion and stress corrosion and are oxygen-compatible, but are susceptible to hydrogen-environment embrittlement
(HEE) at temperatures above -200F. HEE in nickel base alloys can be prevented by avoiding plastic strains or, this being impractical, by providing a pro tective barrier, such as electroplating with copper or gold or overlaying by weld deposition with a nonsus ceptible alloy.

Cobalt Alloys

Cobalt-base alloys, like nickel alloys, offer excellent high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Unlike the nickel alloys, cobalt alloys are immune to HEE.

Alloy 188, a corrosion- and heat-resistant alloy, exhibits outstanding oxidation and creep resistance up to 2100F. Although not hardenable by heat treatment, 188 has moderate room-temperature strength and good cryogenic properties. It also has good resistance to corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking and can be readily welded, including by electron-beam welding.

Elgiloy, a cobalt-base alloy, has found widespread usage for springs. The alloy has high strength and good corrosion resistance, and is nonmagnetic. Elgiloy derives its strength from a combination of heat treatment and cold work. It has a maximum use temperature of approximately 700F.

Titanium Alloys

Titanium alloys possess high strength-to-weight ratios and good toughness, as well as excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. However, titanium alloys are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement at temperatures above -ll0F, and are not compatible with gaseous or liquid oxygen or with red fuming nitric acid, at any temperature. Titanium alloys also are incompatible with the products of combustion from many propellants; these factors limit their usefulness in liquid-propellant rocket en gine systems. They can be applied, however, in fuel systems involving propellants such as liquid hydro gen, monomethyl hydrazine (MMH), and kerosene
(RP-1). They also are compatible, under certain cir cumstances, with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO). Titanium alloys have found use in liquid-propellant rocket en gine systems for pump impellers and inducers, valve bodies, pump housings, high-pressure fuel ducts, hy draulic tubing, pressure bottles, struts, gimbal blocks, propellant-storage bottles, and nozzles.

The most demanding applications have been for use at cryogenic temperatures, where titanium alloys offer some of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of presently available engineering materials. Two tita nium alloys are most commonly used at cryogenic temperatures: Ti-5AI-2.5Sn ELI and Ti-6A1-4V ELI. In the ELI (extra-low interstitial) grade of these alloys, good cryogenic toughness is achieved by controlling the interstitial elements oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen, and the substitutional element iron, to much lower than normal levels. Typically, Ti-6AI-4V ELI is used to -320F while the higher-toughness Ti 5AI-2.5Sn ELI is used as low as -423F. However, Ti 6AI-4V ELI can be employed at -423F if the compo nent design compensates for its lower ductility and toughness.

Titanium and titanium alloys are classified into three major categories according to the predominant phases present in their microstructure: alpha, alpha beta, and beta alloys. Although non-heat-treatable, alpha alloys offer high toughness, are more oxida tion-resistant than alpha-beta or beta alloys, are us able up to about 1000F, and are relatively difficult to form. Ti-5AI-2.5Sn is an example of an alpha alloy. Alpha-beta alloys, such as Ti-6AI-4V, are heat-treat able to higher-strength levels, are usable to 800F and in some instances to 1000F, and are somewhat more formable than alpha alloys. However, alpha-beta al loys ordinarily would not be used in the fully-heat treated condition because its heat-treat response is limited to relatively thin sections (--1.0 in.) and its fracture toughness decreases significantly with in creasing strength level. Beta alloys are generally quite formable at room temperature, are usable up to approximately 600"F, and are heat-treatable to rela tively high strength (e.g., -190 ksi) in thick sections while still retaining good toughness. The disadvan tages of beta alloys are a higher density, lower oxida tion resistance and lower toughness at cryogenic temperatures. Examples of beta alloys include Ti 10V-2Fe-3AI, Ti-3AI-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr, and Ti-15V-3AI 3Cr-3Sn.

Most titanium alloys can be welded, although welding requires the hardware to be thoroughly clean and the operation to be performed in a high-purity inert gas (Ar, He) or vacuum. Titanium and titanium alloys are available as sheet, strip, plate, bar, forgings, extrusions, tubing, and castings.

Thermoplastic Materials

Thermoplastics, polymeric materials that can be formed or reformed by melting or softening with heat, serve well as electrical insulation and seals. They include fluorocarbons, nylon, polycarbonate, and amide-imide materials. Of these, the fluorocar bon polymers find the greatest number of applica tions in liquid-propellant rocket engine design. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene
(Kef-F) with or without fillers or reinforcing fibers find extensive use in rocket engines for seals and coatings for seals due to the compatibility of these materials with oxygen and their properties in both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

rubber materials noted in Fig. C-1 that find extensive use in O-ring seals, gasket-type seals, electrical insula tion, vibration dampers, etc. These materials are also used for adhesives, sealants, formed-in-place seals, and potting of electrical components.

Nitrile rubbers find considerable use because re sistant to oxidation and hydraulic fluids. They do not take a permanent set for long periods of time. Consequently, these rubbers find much use in O-ring seals of hydraulic and pneumatic components.

Silicone rubber, an extensively used sealant and potting compound, has been exploited primarily due to its ease of application and wide usable-tempera ture range of-165-500F. Fluorocarbon rubber is used when  the application requires compatibility with oxygen or when the use temperature is in the range of 300-375F.

Special designs may call for other elastomers, with unique properties. For example, resin-cured butyl has been found to provide excellent seals in NTO and/or hydrazine for short periods (i.e., under one hour).

C a r b o n s  and  Ceramics

Pressed-carbon materials and various ceramics find use in throat inserts for ablative engines, dynamic seals of gas-turbine drives of turbopumps, and coat ings to protect metals from high-temperature gases.

C o m p o s i t e s

A composite has a matrix materal reinforced in ran dom or oriented form with a special fiber, tape, fab ric, etc. Examples would be glass-fiber-filled polyte trafluoroethylene (PTFE), tape-wrapped ablative plas tics, fabric-reinforced epoxy sheets, filament-wound thrust-chamber shells, etc. Composites find a wide range of uses in liquid-propellant rocket engine de sign, such as in seals, thrust-chamber structure, elec trical printed wiring-boards, and ball-bearing separa tors. The matrix may be carbon, metallic, polymeric, or ceramic. Three types of composites might be dis tringuished: structural plastics, ablatives, and carbon carbon composites.

Structural  p las t ics .  Choice of thermosetting resin such as an epoxy, phenolic, or polyimide for fabricating a laminate will depend upon the thermal and adhesive properties required. Epoxy resins offer high adhesive strength, but are more severely limited in maximum use-temperatures. Other resins such as the phenolics or polyimides have very good high temperature characteristics, but at the expense of lowered adhesion and greater fabrication difficulties.



APPENDIX C 403

Reinforcements used in t h e  laminated structure may take the form of layers of fabric, random place ment  of short fibers, or very precise placement of continuous filaments through the use of filament winding or lay-up of collimated tapes. The exact type and form of reinforcement will depend upon the mechanical properties that are to be derived from it. For example,  a cover requiring low mechanical strength and rigidity might be made of random fibers of glass sprayed onto a form with the resin added simultaneously, while a structural shell for a small thrust chamber might well be produced by fil ament-winding a resin-preimpregnated graphite so as to produce a structure with high strength and rigidity.

Ablat ives .  Rocket ablat ives~materials  that can
"sacrificially" cool a thrust chamber or nozz le~usu ally are fabric-reinforced phenolic or rubber-modi fied-phenolic laminated materials. The reinforcing fabric is placed in the formed structure at some pre determined angle to the expected flow of the hot gas. The matrix material and the reinforcing material are each selected for performance with the propellants to be used and the duty cycle of the thrust chamber or nozzle.

The phenolic or rubber-modified-phenolic resins have found the greatest use. They offer a high-tem perature-resistant matrix with predictable properties when exposed to the hot gas of the rocket engine. They form a structural char and provide a cooling gas at the hot surface as they pyrolize. The use of rubber modification yields a somewhat  lower abla tion rate, but keeps the structure from delaminating.

Reinforcements for ablative componen ts  will usually be selected on the basis of the oxidizer. Oxygen-based oxidizers demand the use of a fiber re inforcement that will not oxidize and that has a high melting point plus high viscosity when melted, such as silica glass and quartz, which tend to protect the char from oxidizing rapidly even though there is a high percentage of water vapor in the combustion gases of the thrust chamber. A fluorine-based oxi dizer develops the combustion products that rapidly attack quartz and other glass, forming fibrous materi als. This propellant demands reinforcements of car bon or graphite.

Carbon-carbon compos i tes .  Carbon-carbon compos i t e s~mate r i a l s  with some type of amor phous-carbon matrix reinforced by fibrous carbon or g raph i t e~ f ind  use as thermal shields and nozzle extensions. In all of the uses associated with liquid propellant rocket engine design, these composites have been coated with some form of silicon carbide
(with or without glass formers) to prevent oxidation.

Adhesives

Polymeric and ceramic materials are also used in adhesive applications on rocket engines. In general, silicones are used for sealants and bonding applica tions requiring good peel-strength at temperatures in the range o f - 1 6 5  - 500F; epoxies for high bond shear-strength from -65F to as high as 350F; epoxy phenolics for good bond shear-strength from liquid helium temperature  to 500F; and polyurethanes when bonding must be done with contact pressure without elevated-temperature cure and the material must exhibit good peel and shear strength at a cryo genic temperature. Pressure-sensitive-adhesives hav ing a natural rubber base find use on tapes where the adhesive must be completely removed with the tape.

Lubricants Although some hydrocarbon lubricants used for rocket engines typify those for automotive purposes
(i.e., gear cases), most will have to be selected on the basis of propellant compatibility. As a result, few greases or oils are used. If needed, a grease will usu ally be based on a fluorocarbon oil. Because most oils and greases become brittle at cryogenic temper atures, dry-film lubrication is most often used, the lu bricant usually being pure molybdenum disulfide powder  sprayed onto the component surfaces with some binding agent (usually a resin if a fuel envi ronment or a phosphate material if oxidizer).

Platings, Surface Finishes, Coatings

Components are sometimes given a surface finish to assure corrosion resistance. It can be applied either by electroplating or by an electrolysis process, a chemical film, or a paint. Coatings are also used to give a soft chemical-resistant sealing surface to pres sure-assisted seals.

Chromium and nickel are examples of plating materials commonly used. An anodized surface is an example of a chemical-conversion coating. Zinc or strontium chromate-containing paints are commonly used to protect a variety of metals against corrosion.

Many alloys protect against corrosion with an ox ide film. To assure the formation of this film, the component will often be given a chemical treatment
("passivated") to assure formation of the protective oxide.

The importance of rocket vehicle propulsion system weight to the achievement of the required velocity increment with a given payload wieght is presented in this appendix.

As was seen with residual propellants, excessive dead weight at burnout imposes penalties. Whenever rocket engines can be made lighter without compro mising reliability and structural integrity, the payoff in range and payload will therefore be sizable. Engine and vehicle builders usually distinguish sev eral types of engine weight:

Dry weight. The net weight of the engine as it leaves the factory.

Burnout weight. Engine dry weight plus residual, measurable propellants remaining in the engine at cutoff. In a typical engine design, burnout weight may be 4% higher than dry weight. Burnout weight plays importantly in vehicle mass ratio (Eq. 1-30).

Wet weight. The engine dry weight plus all pro pellant within it, during main stage. In a typical design, engine wet weight may be 6% higher than dry weight. Wet weight significantly affects vehicle in flight center of gravity and moments of inertia.

Wet gimballed weight. This portion of wet weight represents engine mass gimballed for steering purposes. In earlier designs this meant essentially the thrust-chamber and injector wet-weight. In later designs it often refers to the entire engine less a rel atively small amount of stationary parts. This weight affects gimbal actuator loads and response char acteristics of the guidance control loop.

Ideally, dry weight and burnout weight should be equal; that is, no propellants should be trapped in the engine at shutdown. In practice, this will not al ways be possible. However, the engine designer can do much to bring it about through proper design, sizing and routing of lines, avoidance of traps, and location of valves.

Because of the importance of weight control, rocket-engine manufacturers employ "engineers specifically in charge of this area. Table A-1 shows a typical weight progress form, as used by the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International. It is revised and reissued periodically. Thus it becomes a useful tool to raise early warnings of a trend to overweight. The arbitrary example shows a slight underweight. However, the table also shows the data to be based almost entirely on estimated and cal culated figures, rather than on actual weighing results. This is characteristic for the earlier phases of design and development of a rocket engine. More often than not, the weight advantage will disappear gradually as the design firms up; then the squeeze will be on. For convenient display of the weight tenden cies over time, a graph like Fig. A-1 will be useful.

The weight changes of the various components as well as of the entire engine affect centers of gravity and moments of inertia. Through issue of a data sheet like Fig. A-2, all parties concerned can be kept informed on changes as they occur.

Note that the data presented in Table A-1 and Fig. A-1 and A-2 concern the 150,000-1b A-2 Stage engine system, a part of an assumed multistage space vehicle configuration.

Consider the influence of structural weight on the performance and gross takeoff weight of a rocket vehicle, and how its magnitude varies with the design parameters of different vehicle systems. The quan titative relationships will be evaluated individually for each case.

Equation (1-30) can be rewritten for the stage burnout velocity of a single-stage vehicle or the stage velocity increment of any individual stage of a multistage vehicle system, as follows:

APPENDIX A 39 1

For a given burnout velocity these equations show an even weight tradeoff between stage engine system weight and stage payload weight. The weight of all other items being kept constant, a pound decrease in the stage engine-system weight will increase the stage payload capacity by one pound.

For a fixed payload, and assuming other items except engine weight to be constant, the relation be tween the stage velocity increment Vbo and stage en gine-system weight for a given system can be written as follows:

k(~22 + Stage engine system weight'~
Vbo = klln + Stage engine system ~ )

(A-3)

where kl = Cvcg(Is)oa = constant k2 = Stage payload weight + Stage residual-pro pellant weight at burnout + Stage structure, guidance and other weight = constant k 3 = Stage usable-propellant weight + k2 = con stant

Since k2 < k 3, the denominator will decrease more rapidly than the numerator, with decreasing engine weight. Thus fixed payloads increase burnout ve locity, which will pay off in longer range or higher orbit.

For a given burnout velocity and for a fixed payload, the required Stage average overall specific impulse (Is)oa in terms of Stage engine-system weight can be established as follows:

(k 3 + System engine system weight'~
(Is)oa = k4/ln ~ k2 + St-~ge ~ sys---~-emem ~ )

(A-4)

where-- Vbo k4 - Cvcg - constant

Equation (A-4) shows that the overall-specific-im pulse requirements decrease with decreasing engine system weight.

The "growth factor" of a rocket vehicle also il lustrates the importance of weight. If the weight of a component increases, for instance, the designer can adjust for this by increasing the propellant load and thus possibly that of other components, such as a pump, to maintain the same required vehicle per formance--i.e. ,  payload and vehicle trajectory. If one part of the vehicle system exceeds its weight allotment by one pound, the total vehicle system weight at takeoff will see a certain number of ad ditional pounds. Growth factor is defined as the total vehicle-system (including payload) weight increase at takeoff divided by the causal increment of added inert and/or payload weight. Growth factor for a given vehicle system will not be a precise value, but rather vary within a band. For instance, a small weight increase of a component in an existing system may only require the addition of a corresponding small amount of propellant, but not require enlarge ment of the tanks, valves, etc.; then the growth factor will be small. In another case, the weight increase may be "the straw that breaks the camel's back," re quiring the use of the next-larger valve, duct, or the like; the growth factor will then be large.

In general, growth factor gives the designer a useful tool during the early steps to an engine system, because it attaches a tangible value to the importance of the engine-system weight. A systems-weight in crease may be considered "uninvited payload." For single-stage vehicles, and relatively small weight changes, the value of the growth factor then can be expressed with sufficient accuracy as follows:

Total vehicle system Growth factor = weight at takeoff

Payload weight (A-5)

For any stage of a multistage vehicle, the approx imate value of the growth factors against total ve hicle-system weight at takeoff can be expressed as follows:

Growth factor =

Total vehicle system weight at takeoff

Stage payload weight (A-6)

The growth factors of any stage against the vehicle system weight at ignition of the same or lower stage can be expressed as follows:

Vehicle system weight at same or lower stage ignition Growth factor = (A-7)

Stage payload weight

Sample Calculation

A three-stage rocket has the following weight data:
total vehicle-system weight at takeoff, 40,000 lb.;
vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition, 7500
lb; vehicle system at third-stage ignition, 2200 lb;
payload weight, 700 lb.

P r o b l e m

For each pound increase of engine-system weight of first, second, and third stages, respectively, determine
(at a constant vehicle performance) (a)  increases of total vehicle-system weight at takeoff, and ( b )
increases of vehicle-system weight at second- and third-stage ignition.

Solution:

(a) Payload weight of first stage = vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition = 7500 lb; pay load weight of second stage = vehicle-system weight at third-stage ignition = 2200 lb; payload weight of third stage = actual system payload weight -- 700 lb.



392 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

From Eq. (A-6):

1) Growth factor of first stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
m

First-stage payload weight 7,500 - 5.86

2) Growth factor of second stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
Second-stage payload weight - 2,200 - 2 0

3) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
Third-stage payload weight - 700 - 62.9

Therefore.

1) For each pound increase of first-stage engine system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 5.86 lb.

2) For each pound increase of second-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 20 lb.

3) For each pound increase of third-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 62.9 lb.

Co) Note that the weight growth of lower stages will not affect the upper-stage weight growth. For an increase of first-stage vehicle-system weight, there will be no weight changes on second and third stages; and for an increase on second stage vehicle system weight, no weight change will be required for the third stage. From Eq.
(a-7)"

1) Growth factor vehicle-system ignition:

of second stage against weight  at second-stage

Vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition 7,500

Second-stage payload weight 2,200 - ~ =  3 . 4 1

2) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition:

Vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition 7,500

m

Third-stage payload weight 700 - 10.72

3) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system weight at third-stage ignition:

Vehicle system weight at third-stage ignition 2,200

Third-stage payload weight 700 - 3 . 1 4

Therefore.

1) For each pound increase of second-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition will be 3.41 lb.

2), 3) For each pound increase of third-stage engine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition will be 10.72 lb and the increase on vehicle-system weight at third-stage ignition will be 3.14 lb.

The correctness of results can be checked by recombining the individual stage growth factors to obtain the growth factor for the entire vehicle system:

3.14 x 3.41 x 5.86 = 62.9



Appendix B

Reliability Considerat ions

The effort to increase reliability in rocket engines should span the entire program spectrum from con ceptual design through production. The reliability ef fort can basically be split into three parts: preven tion of failures, process assessment and control, and monitoring of performance. Reliability through pre vention involves early involvement of reliability en gineers in "concurrent engineering" design and de velopment loops to identify high-risk devices and de signs and catastrophic failure modes. Both before and during fabrication and fielding of hardware, po tential process faults and their effects should be eval uated and controlled to assure expected reliability performance through a "Continuous Process Im p rovement  (CPI)" approach.  The cont inuous monitoring of performance needs to be organized in a formal way (e.g., Reliability Growth or Reliability Demonstration Test Monitoring) to assure identifica tion and correction of possible faults.

Reliability in Design

The reliability contribution to a concurrent engineer ing effort should be through assessment of past per formance of similar-type hardware to identify high failure-risk components or approaches in the pro posed designs, conducting reliability-optimization trade studies, and correlating past "lessons learned"
in rocket-engine-specific systems. Potential process inadequacies should be addressed, with considera tion for control of a process or designing in "fault tolerance." For example, process-induced contam ination may be a problem largely solvable by en largement of flow passages in the engine systems.

Another aspect of reliability in design, so-called
"simplicity," usually will contribute significantly to higher reliability. Parts which do not fulfill a truly useful purpose should be omitted; this may include many so-called safety features and interlocking de vices, which often cause more trouble than they pre vent. Early designs of liquid-propellant rocket en gines indeed often suffered from an overdose of so phistication and safety devices. Many of the more recent designs have been substantially improved in this area. Simplifications, like all other design fea tures, must be carefully planned and evaluated. Simplification by elimination of a useful component must not become an excuse for failure to improve that component if its absence could severely penalize other subsystems or maintenance and servicing pro cedures.

The counterpoint to simplicity will be redun dancy. Occasionally, the reliability of certain types of parts are inherently too low or the consequences of the failure effect are too great to accept. Then a redundant  functional architecture may be consid er_ed, in which complexity, in terms of more parts, will be increased to achieve a higher reliability. The additional cost, weight, and failure modes must be

393

weighed against the reduction in probability of the failure mode of concern. Man-rated systems typi cally have the additional requirement to isolate phys ically the redundant element from its sister element to assure protection from common causes of failure
(e.g., contamination, heat, vibration, explosion, etc.). Additionally, the operational status of each element of the redundancy may have to be monitored to as sure its existence before flight.

For instance, to avoid a troublesome sealed con nection it may be decided to omit flanges and seals and to weld it. However, if one of the lines thus con nected were inadvertently pinched in the field, it would be necessary to remove the entire engine from the vehicle under preparation for launchmmagnify ing a simple replacement into a major operation. To be sure, welding or preferably brazing may indeed be the best solution for many problem connections. The point is, this will not be true for all connections. The design team must carefully analyze all aspects of the system including handling and, in particular, mis handling by the user.

As another example, tests may have shown that an engine could readily be set up and calibrated to specifications by means of orifices, eliminating pre viously used regulators. Engines get delivered ac cordingly. With rocket engines, it is entirely normal that many months,' if not several years, may elapse between delivery and final use. Much can happen during this period. Changes in mission plans, for in stance, may have made another thrust level more de sirable. Then, suddenly, an adjustment by means of orifices, in particular its verification, becomes a ma jor operation. Omission of a strategic regulator was indeed an engine simplification, but for the vehicle system it turned out to be a complication. The point, again: careful evaluation of a planned omission must consider all aspects, including changes of plans.

Reliability Assurance

The emphasis on reliability must not become an empty slogan. Fortunately, the rocket-engine de signer has certain means to achieve the highest de gree of reliability. One of these is an effective
"failure report ing and corrective action system
(FRACAS)" during the monitoring of hardware test activities. Testing of all hardware should be moni tored in an organized and regimented fashion to as sure identification and resolution of hardware design and processing failures. The design~ should, at the very least, implement a fundamental FRACAS loop. This may be supplemented with a "reliability growth"
assessment program to appraise regularly the pro gress of the engine system toward the expected reliability performance. In many cases, a "reliability demonstration" test program may be proposed to determine, with "confidence," the final reliability per formance of the engine system.



394 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

D e f i n i t i o n s

The definitions used in rocket-engine reliability pro grams vary widely with individual program require ments, with the object under design and develop ment, and with the missions contemplated. The def initions given below typify usage in actual rocket en gine programs, and can be readily adapted to others. For the sake of clarity, irrelevant jargon and detail have been omitted.

Reliability. The probability that a part or sys tem will function properly and, if necessary, repeat edly under  rated operating conditions, within the specified load and time limits.

Mission success. Completion of the rocket-en gine mission objectives within specified tolerances. All subsystems contribute to the success. It is an in herent characteristic of mission-success analysis and assurance that they anticipate the probability of cer tain part and subsystem malfunctions, offsetting them with appropriate countermeasures (such as redun dancies, emergency power sources, power and pro pellant reserves, etc.).

Mission failure. Failure of the rocket engine to produce the required thrust for the specified time to complete the mission objectives. Mission failures can be classified as catastrophic, premature shut down, and "deferred."

Catas t roph ic  f a i l u r e  (Cri t ical i ty  I ) .  An
"uncontained" failure in which the effects propagate beyond the physical envelope of the engine system, with sufficient energy potential likely to propagate failure to adjacent systems. It is important to assess and discriminate this type of failure from a prema ture shutdown for crew safety in manned vehicles and for mission success in multi-engine unmanned vehi cles (if engine out is a viable mode of operation).

Premature  shutdown (Criticality 11). A fail ure in which the effects are contained and degrade performance enough to trigger an engine shutdown. In multi-engined vehicles with "engine-out" capa bility, the discrimination between catastrophic failure and premature shutdown figures importantly in the criteria for vehicle mission success.

Deferred  fa i lure  (Criticality III). A failure causing generally slow-acting and minor perfor mance degradation in which continued operation of the engine is a consideration. Action to cope with the failure will be deferred to allow analysis by the pi lot or an automatic logic, to decide whether correc tive action can be taken or an abort sequence should

be initiated. Typical example: shutting off an engine in a four-engine airplane and reaching destination safely, although with a delay. Analogous provisions are anticipated for manned rockets.

Man-rating. Design and operational provisions to assure crew survival even in case of mission failure. Thus, man-rated crew reliability typically exceeds mission reliability. For instance, overall vehicle reli ability to achieve mission success may be 95%. By the addition of an escape mechanism, man-rated re liability may be increased to 99.5%. Caution is ad vised not to become entirely "wrapped up" in man rating at the expense of mission reliability. A single launch of a man-carrying space vehicle costs several hundred million dollars, all told. Investment in means to save the mission as well as the man, there fore, appears to be prudent. Table B-1 illustrates this clearly. Pressing optimum reliability for spacecraft and launch vehicle, including the engines, therefore minimizes the need for a crew-escape system.

Engine out.  Design and operational provisions in a multi-engine system to permit limited or com plete mission continuance in case one engine fails to fire or malfunctions and gets shut down. This option can notably improve system reliability since one of the engines is a redundant element.

Failure mode. The specific manner in which a part or system malfunctions. This may be a "short"
or "open" circuit, an incorrectly "closed" or "open"
valve, an engine out, or similar malfunction.

Order o f  failure. The number  of components in a system that would have to fail, regardless of their failure mode, to cause a system or mission failure. First-order failures derive from malfunction of a sin gle component  or part (i.e., "single-point" failure). Second- and higher-order failures are defined in a like manner. Typical example: a stuck pressurizing valve causing overpressure in a vessel would rupture it only if the safety valve failed to open; this would be second-order failure. However, continuous venting of a properly opening vent valve may prematurely de plete the gas supply. A thorough failure-effect analy sis will reveal all ramifications. In the example, de pletion would not occur instantaneously; this would be "deferred" failure. The designer can do some thing about it in advance, such as by giving the pilot an overriding closing valve that remains completely inactive when not needed (al though--not  a complete blessingmthis adds weight).

Failure modes and effects analysis. An or derly, hardware-based analysis listing all credible modes in which components or parts of a system can fail, the effects of the failures on the engine's or vehi cle's ability to complete the mission, and the order of the failures. Such an analysis should distinguish between the prelaunch, launch, and cutoff phases. All identified failure modes should be classified as catas trophic, premature shutdown, or "deferred." This hardware-to-effect approach assures that all notable pieces of hardware will be addressed and assessed.

Fault-tree analysis. An event-based analysis that targets specific failure-effect scenarios and then lists all the hardware malfunctions in a graphical, hi erarchical "tree" (a reverse of the hardware-to-effect approach of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis).



APPENDIX B 395

Emergency detection system (EDS). T h e EDS comprises the electromechanical devices, in cluding sensors and discriminators, to detect an im minent malfunction. Depending on the type of fail ure  ( ca t a s t roph ic ,  p r e m a t u r e  s h u t d o w n ,  or
"deferred"), it may initiate immediate action, or defer but store and/or  display it in a suitable manner
(timer, visual gage, or light). Inputs to the EDS must be analyzed, selected, and provided by the designer
(in particular, the engine designer) at the outset.

Noncomplex redundancy. The simultaneous function of identical equipment.  Application de pends upon the particular failure mode to be elimi nated. For a typical example, see Fig. B-1 and B-2. Other examples include dual (series) seals and paral lel valves.

Complex redundancy. The original function carried out by one component. Failure sensors, logic circuits, and switching devices energize an identical standby component,  when needed. The advantages obtained can be completely offset by the additional complexity of sensing and switching circuitry. The potential problem area may be merely shifted from the equipment to the failure-detection components. However, this standby redundancy may be advanta geous for long mission times (e.g., days or weeks)
where it may be undesirable also to subject the backup equipment to prolonged operation. A typical example: electric-power emergency battery with volt age sensor and switchover circuitry.

Failure Modes of Engine Components

Failure of a rocket-engine component  may be at tributed to basically three causes: functional, struc tural, and process faults. They have the following principal modes: functional failures, fatigue failures, overstress and overstrain, failures pertaining to com bustion devices, failures pertaining to electrical devices, manufacturing and material defects, unex plained failures, human error, and manufacturing of field-processing faults.

Functional failures. Something other than structural failure can cause malfunction of parts or components.  For instance, an "0" ring may fail to seal due to improper groove depth specified in the design; or a plunger may freeze in the bore of a guid ing bushing, because of improper  surface finish and/or  noncompatibility of materials. The following precautions will minimize possible function failures in the design of engine components:

 Choose proven designs with an established service record.

 Use standard mechanical elements (bolts, nuts, threads, gears, pins, rivets, springs, seals, tube fittings, pistons, keys, shafts, bearings) wherever possible.

 Select simple designs, but without impairing flexibility. In particular, minimize the number of moving parts and sealing surfaces.

 Allow adequate functional margins in the de sign of components (spring forces, actuating powers, supply of lubricants, supply of coolants).

 Subject newly designed parts to extensive func tional testing, under simulated working and environ mental conditions, before "freezing" the final config uration.

 Provide redundancy, a "buddy plan": where one component would be sufficient, provide two of the same type. If one fails, the other takes over. This can be achieved in two ways: by noncomplex and by complex redundancy. Intelligently applied, redun dancy can significantly increase reliability.

 Pursue a rigorous program of continuous product improvement.

Fatigue failures. Fatigue failures are fractures caused by repeated loading at stresses considerably lower than those causing failure by a single load. They are the most common type of mechanical fail ure. The ability of a part to resist fatigue failure can not be checked without destroying the part. Checking is possible, however, through destructive endurance tests with representative samples selected at random.

Most fatigue failures start with a crack at or near an outside surface because stresses are apt to be greatest there. The actual failure will result from gradual propagation of these cracks.

The starting point for a crack will depend upon the geometry of the part and on surface conditions. Any notch or other stress-raiser, being a point of high stress concentration, may start fatigue cracks. Fillet radii too small, threads, oil holes, keyways and similar surface irregularities all present  po ten t i a l sources of fatigue failure. Although a part may be de signed to be free of geometric irregularities, having no shoulders, grooves or the like, it may still contain a great number of minute stress-raisersmtool marks, scratches, identification stamp marks, or various in herent discontinuities in the material itself, such as inclusions of foreign matter and quenching cracks.

The design engineer should make every effort to avoid stress concentrations in a highly stressed part subject to repeated loads. In the design, rigid speci fications should be called out for surface finishes. To carry repeated loads, forgings are usually preferable to castings, and ductile materials to material prone to become brittle. Welded joints see almost every type of stress concentration and fatigue failure. Wherever



396 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES possible, welded joints should be minimized in the design of parts subject to repeated loads. Rigid pro cedures for welding and inspection must be called out in the design.

O v e r s t r e s s  a n d  overs t ra in .  Stress analysis in mechanical design to prevent overstress and over strain was discussed in section 2.5.3. The interrela tionship of stress and reliability of mechanical parts
(as illustrated simplistically in Fig. B-3) can be evalu ated probabilistically.

Two stress levels exist for every part in a given engine component: the working stress and the dam aging stress at which failure occurs. The failure may be either a fracture or a deformation beyond allow able tolerances. Either will be a mean value of a dis tribution about a mean. The difference between the working and the damaging stress mean values indi cates the stress reliability margin of the part.

Deviations from the mean working stress mainly reflect variations in the dimensions of the part and operational and environmental conditions. The dis tribution about the mean damaging stress results from variations in material properties, fabrication processes, quality control, and maintenance prac tices. The area Pf, where the two distributions over lap, represents the probabil i ty of failure (unre liability).

Close control of functional and environmental loads may decrease the variation of the working stress about the mean. Likewise, better materials and strict quality control should increase the damaging stress mean value and decrease the variation about the mean. Thus, the area of overlap may be substan tially reduced or el iminated,  and reliability in creased.

Failure o f  combust ion  dev ices .  Under steady state operating conditions, combustion devices in liquid-propellant rocket engines must withstand hot gases- - tempera tures  ranging from 1000 to 6000F. The walls of these devices either are made from high temperature-resist ing (refractory) materials or are cooled by heat-absorbtion, ablation, and propellant film and/or  regenerative effects. Structural failure may occur because of erosion from wall temperatures z z

Under certain transient or unstable conditions, such as engine start or stop, combustion instability or abrupt pressure surges may cause a failure; see Chapter 4, "Design of Thrust Chambers and Other Combustion Devices."

Elec t r ica l  f a i l u r e s .  Although predominant ly an assembly of mechanical parts, a modern rocket engine employs a number of electrical devices with out which it cannot function reliably. Electrical components used most widely include power sources
(batteries), converters (dc to ac), microprocessors, tranducers, wires and harnesses, connectors, switches, relays (electromechanical  and solid-state), timers, pressure switches, diodes, solenoid valves, servomo tors, and position indicators.

All of these devices represent, to some degree, a potential source of failure, the consequences of which can be just as detrimental as failure of mechanical parts. By proper design and assembly instructions, by careful select ion of the elements,  and by Environmental Stress Screening (ESS), the designer can forestall electrical failures and thus assure overall system reliability. Common points of electrical fail ure include the following:

 Cold-solder spots in connectors, wirings, and electrical elements. They often cause sporadic dis continuities, particularly under vibration.

 Short circuits in wirings, connectors, and other electrical devices. This may be due to poor design, leaving insufficient separation between connector pins, lugs, and the like; or to excessive solder; or damaged insulation due to poor harness installation, chafing under vibration, and poor handling; or over load and/or  overheating in solenoids, moisture in connectors, etc.

 Fused relay contacts, due to overload and/or incorrect current rating of the elements.

 Relay and switch contact-loss under vibration. This is really an electromechanical malfunction. It can be prevented by proper relay selection, shock mounting, orientation of installation, or replacement by solid-state circuitry.

 Power failure resulting from one or more of the causes listed above. Preventions include emer gency batteries and overload switches, combined with subcircuit isolation through diodes.

A liquid-propellant rocket engine usually includes additional electrical elements as required for instru mentat ion and te lemetry-- ins t rumenta t ion  power supplies, end organs (sensors, pickups, thermocou pies, accelerometers ,  position indicators), signal conditioners (analog-to-digital), wiring, and the like. Although, as a rule, instrumentation does not directly effect proper functioning of the engine system, its failure may indirectly cause engine malfunction, by interfering with its operation. For instance, a pres sure pickup may rupture and cause premature deple tion of a gas supply; the same event in the fuel system may cause an engine-compartment fire; improper in stallation of a thermocouple may block a vital lubri cant or other line.



APPENDIX B 397

The engine designer's task includes engine in strumentation. It is obvious that this peripheral sys tem, too, will require his full attention.

Manufacturing and material  defects. The producibility of parts directly affects the reliability of components. Manufacturing and material defects can be prevented only by strict process and quality control. The areas of quality control may be subdi vided as follows:

 Materials inspection.  The extent of inspec tion and testing of raw materials depends upon the nature of the part for which they will be used. Inspection of materials includes testing for composi tion, uniformity, mechanical properties, fabrication and heat-treating characteristics, and possibly other properties, as the application may demand.

 Traceability. By the time a materials defect is detected, many more parts may have been made from the same lot or batch of raw material. If accu rate records have been kept on parts for which num bered material lots have been used, it will be possi ble, without a "panic," to withdraw and replace all parts made from the faulty lot. The importance of accurate and complete records is obvious.

 Process inspection. This refers to all shop in spections made of parts as they are being processed. It in effect checks the performance of the operators and tools or equipment, and sorts out faulty parts as soon as errors are detected.

 Salvage. Someone decides whether defective materials or parts can be corrected or must be scrapped.

 Final inspection. This inspection covers the completed component  parts to ensure they come within the limits required by the design.

 Checking o f  ac tual  service performance.  This includes investigation of complaints and studies of actual service performance of the part in the engine system (see "Failure-Reporting System").

R e l i a b i l i t y  d e m o n s t r a t i o n .  This is a strict, re liability test series in which the "matured" engine sys tem configuration is repeatedly tested in the same configuration and mission cycle. The primary objec tive is to statistically determine the reliability per formance level and confidence limits for the engine configuration.

R e l i a b i l i t y - g r o w t h  m o n i t o r i n g .  This is typi cally a monitoring and assessment task over engi neering development  test programs to continually assess the development (i.e., "growth") in the reliabil ity performance of an engine system. Early successes and failures are plotted to continually check for the expected improvements through corrective actions and process improvements.

H u m a n  error. Experience with early manned rocket flights showed that certain functions could be performed better by trained men than by automatic devices. It appears certain that future spaceflight will employ combinations of automatic and manual sys tems, the ratio of the two depending on mission re quirements. Even unmanned missions, ostensibly fully automatic, have people directly involved during launch preparations and through postlaunch com mands for trajectory-correction maneuvers, informa tion playback, and similar actions.

As recent nuclear powerplant catastrophes attest, even a fully trained, possible very alert individual can be subject to error. He may commit an error at a desk while using a computer, or while connecting a number of hydraulic lines, or under stress while push ing buttons. The history of rocketry ~ is full of glaring examples. Whenever it happens, the most eloquent regrets are probably voiced by the designers of the system involved: If someone had not done some thing to their perfect creation, it would have worked faultlessly. The reaction is understandable,  but wrong.

For whatever reason a system failed, it obviously was not perfect. Its designer did not consider human nature, non-ideal operating conditions, or emergency situations. Clear and complete drawings, specifica tions, and other written instructions are important, but they will not prevent, by themselves, human er rors, because they can be misplaced, misread, or not read at all.

It is not surprising that the elimination of human error, or more positively, the perfection of the inte gration of man with the machine, is becoming an in dependent branch of engineering. It would be be yond the scope of this book to go into the details of
"Human Engineering" or "Human Factors Analysis."
Simply by applying mostly known methods and common sense, the rocket-engine designer can do much to prevent human error by the design of his parts and by mandatory actions during their build ing, checking, and handling. The following are only typical examples of a probably infinite number  of ways to prevent human error by design:

 Clear marking of bolts, lines, connectors, wires.
 Use of dissimilar connectors ,  dissimilar threads, a variety of keyways, etc. to make incorrect electrical and mechanical connections impossible.

 Safety wiring, electrical and mechanical inter locks.

 Painting bright red and/or  attaching bright red streamers to auxiliary devices that must be re moved before operation.

 Storing of components and systems that have successfully passed all inspections and checkouts in locked, controlled-storage rooms.

 Simulated, mock opera t ions~with  intentional attempts at improper handling, assembly, checkout, and operation of components and sys tems~to  assist
"foolproofing" during development.

None of these and numerous similar steps will eliminate human errors. However, they will substan tially reduce the likelihood of them and thus con tribute to overall reliability.

Design Reviews for Reliability

The reliability of a rocket engine and its components depends on many factors. A concurrent engineering approach topped with periodic design reviews can bulwark reliability. In practice, a design review, the progressive evaluation of a design, starts with the pre liminary schematics, layouts, and specifications and extends through the release of all final drawings. Those conducting reliability design reviews should include reliability specialists, design engineers, de


398 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES velopment, test, and service engineers, and various specialists for structures, materials, manufacturing, and quality control. A minimum of three design re views should be made for each design:

1) Preliminary design review. This is a prelim inary review of work statements, basic concepts, schematics, layouts, and analyses. It determines de velopment needs and results in decisions for the next design phases. This review should uncover misappli cations, critical areas and marginal designs at an early stage, when changes can be effected without dif ficulty.

2) Critical design review. This is the most im portant review for decisions and approvals. It in cludes formal review of all reliability aspects of lay outs, analyses, planned development tests, and pro curement specifications.

3) Final design review. This is the final review of overall design layouts, detail and assembly draw ings, analyses, process specifications, and R&D test results, before production release.

The reviews should emphasize the following points: structural integrity, function and performance, customer (vehicle) connections and envelope, mate rials compatibility and component  interfaces, pro ducibility and cost, reliability and repeatability, mal function effects, environment  and servicing, and
"special" requirements. It is highly recommended that the agreed-to layout bear the approval signatures of the groups involved.

A reliability checklist tailored to the individual designs may be used as a guide during the various design-review phases. The "Design Check-Off Sheet"
shown in section 2.5 may serve this purpose.

Design reviews are valuable and cost-saving tools for improving reliability. A group well organized and staffed will assure a meaningful review and instigate effective recommendations and actions. Complete documentation of all review details will provide valu able data for future reference.

Failures occur, from time to time, that cannot readily be isolated as having originated in a given component  or par t - -because  several causes were present simultaneously and could not tge separated, because instrumentation was inadequate, recording only the ultimate effects but not the cause, or because an incomplete investigation was conducted, perhaps in the hope it would not happen again.

Classification of a failure as "unexplained" should never be done as a matter of convenience, but rather only as a last resort if the most thorough investiga tion did not establish a clear cause. Complete and accurate records must be kept of the details associ ated with the failure. Through special statistical methods it may be possible to isolate the cause or causes at a later date. Also, special instrumentation may immediately be added in the areas of suspected but unproven causes. But the most sophisticated ex planation of a failure cannot transform it into a suc cess.

Under "Man-rating" the cost of a single launch was mentioned. Press releases give the cost of a ma jor space program as about 3.5 billion dollars a yea rml0  million a day! To save a mission, or just a single day of preparation, by improved reliability will quite clearly be worth the effort!

Likewise, the loss of a launch, or a day in the pro gram, is very costly indeed. The rocket-engine de signer must do everything he can to prevent either.



Appendix C

Rocket Engine Materials

Liquid propellant rocket engines utilize a wide range They are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking and of materials; from steel alloys to thermoplastics and hydrogen embrittlement and become quite brittle at composites. This appendix presents a brief dis- cryogenic temperatures. With the exception of 440C, cussion of a range of material types and their general martensitic stainless steels have limited usefulness on application in the design of liquid propellant rocket liquid propellant rocket engines. Being a high-car engines, bon alloy, 440C attains the highest hardness of the stainless steels. It is widely used for bearings and Plain-Carbon/Low-Alloy Steels other compressively loaded hardware requiring wear resistance.

Plain-carbon steels alloy iron and carbon. The low carbon grades (0.1-0.2%) have excellent ductility and toughness and are easily formed. The medium-car bon grades (0.3-0.5%) respond well to heat treatment, and thus provide a good combination of strength and toughness. The high-carbon grades (1.0-1.2%)
are hard and wear-resistant, but have poor toughness and ductility.

Low-alloy steels contain up to 2.0% alloying ele ment in addition to the iron and carbon. Adding al loying elements to steel increases hardenability (i.e., ability to harden through thick sections). Other im provements derived from alloy addition include im proved elevated-temperature properties, tough-hess, and corrosion resistance.

Plain-carbon and low-alloy steels are n o t  good candidates for rocket-engine hardware. Although in expensive, readily available, easy to fabricate, and typically high in strength, steels poorly resist atmo spheric corrosion and will rust in ambient environ ments unless protected. Also, they have a limited range of useful operating temperatures. Most steels become brittle below 0F and, on the high-tempera ture side, are limited by tempering temperature, which is usually below 1000F. Plain-carbon and al loy steels are susceptible to hydrogen-environment embrittlement, and are not resistant to stress-corro sion cracking in some heat-treat conditions.

Stainless Steels

In stainless steels--iron-carbon alloys with the addi Austen i t i c  s t a i n l e s s  s t ee l s  (300 series). The austenitic stainless steels all contain nickel in addi tion to the chromium. Nickel stabilizes austenite, normally a high-temperature phase, at room temper ature and below. Austenite differs from martensite in many respects. The nonmagnetic austenitic stainless steels are not heat-treatable, and cannot achieve the high strength of martensitic alloys. However, they possess good cryogenic toughness, good fabricability and weldability, excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to stress-corrosion cracking, and are com patible with oxygen and hydrogen. Relatively low cost, high availability, and good fabricability make austenitic stainless steels an excellent choice for rocket-engine components where strength-to-weight ratio is not a primary consideration.

Most austenitic stainless steels will be limited in usefulness by their low (30-ksi) room-temperature yield strength. Alloy 21-6-9, a nitrogen-strengthened modification, has about twice the yield strength at room temperature and three times the yield strength at -400F of 300-series stainless steel. It does not re quire heat treatment and possesses all of the other at tributes of austenitic stainless steels.

The corrosion resistance of all stainless steels can be severely diminished by denying access to a plentiful supply of oxygen. For this reason, any ap plication which results in close laying surfaces or crevices should be avoided. Multiply assemblies, such as bellows, are therefore not ideal applications for stainless steels.

Moreover, a carbide precipitation characterizes many austenitic stainless steels when heated in the

,1 ,1 tion of at least 12% chromium--the chromium pro- temperature range of 800-1600F. This sensitization vides a "passive" oxide film that protects the body reduces corrosion resistance.

The prob Oxygen shielding could cause deterioration of this lems of sensitization can be mitigated by utilizing passive film, rendering the steel "active"--having low-arbon grades (304L, 316L) or stabilized grades corrosion resistance and galvanic activity similar to (321,347) of austenitic stainless steels. those of low-alloy steels.

However, most of the PH stainless steels are martensitic, and as such are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking, hydrogen environment embrittlement, and loss of toughness at cryogenic temperatures.  An exception, A286, austenitic steel, possesses all of the attributes of the austenitic stainless steels coupled with high strength
(up to 200-ksi ultimate tensile strength in the cold worked condition). A286 has proven to be excep tionally suitable for fasteners, and has been used for nozzle tubing. Poor weldability limits wider applica tion of A286. JBK 75, a modification of A286, is not susceptible to weld cracking and therefore has appli cability for rocket-engine hardware.

Iron-Base SuperaIIoys

The iron-base low-expansion superalloys have exten sive application in liquid-propellant rocket engines because they provide high strength, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and resistance to hydrogen-envi ronment embrittlement (HEE). These iron-nickel cobalt alloys retain excellent properties from-423 to
1200F, are resistant to stress-corrosion cracking, and are readily weldable. However, lack of resistance to corrosion limits the use of them.

Incoloy 903 was the first of these alloys to find widespread application to structural components op erating in gaseous hydrogen or hydrogen-rich steam. It also can be used as an overlay to provide HEE pro tection to welds of non-HEE-resistant alloys. Incoloy
903 can be thermomechanically processed (TMP) for improved high-temperature stress-rupture properties.

Incoloy 907 offers~ better stress-rupture properties without requiring the TMP procedure. Incoloy 909
offers better low-cycle fatigue life and a simplified heat-treat cycle, which is compatible with that for Inconel 718. The weldability of Incoloy 907 has been rated higher than that of Incoloy 903, and Incoloy
909 has been shown to be the most weldable of the group.

Aluminum Alloys

Aluminum alloys are low in cost, easily fabricated, and readily available, but are limited in rocket-engine usage by maximum operating temperature. The high strength wrought alloys (i.e., 2024, 7075) are limited to
200-300F while the cast alloys such as Tens-50 and
356 can be used in the 300-400F range. The devel opment of aluminum-base-metal matrix composites has extended the operational limits of wrought alu minum alloys to the 800-900F range. However, lim ited availability, high cost, and difficulties in fabrica tion have been deterrents to the use of these com posites in rocket engines. All of the aluminum alloys are light in weight, resistant to hydrogen embrittle ment, and (most) have excellent cryogenic proper ties. Caution should be exercised with aluminum ap plications in oxygen systems because of low ignition temperature.

The casting alloys, low-strength wrought alloys, and moderate-strength 6061 are weldable. Corrosion resistance varies from excellent to fair; but in general the higher-strength alloys must be anodized for at mospheric-  and galvanic-corrosion protection. Anodizing forms an electrically insulating layer that could preclude electrical grounding.

Copper Alloys

Copper of course has high electrical and thermal conductivity, excellent corrosion resistance, and ease of fabrication, plus immunity to hydrogen-environ ment embrittlement. Alloying elements improve its strength, but generally at the expense of electrical and thermal conductivity. For example, 2% beryl lium can increase ultimate tensile strength of copper from 30 to 200 ksi; but the electrical conductivity of beryllium copper is only 20% of pure copper.

The more widely used copper alloys--brass
(copper and zinc), phosphor bronze (copper and tin), and beryllium copper (copper and beryl l ium) have strength increasing in the order listed.

The major application of copper alloys in rocket engines is for high-heat-flux applications, such as combustion chambers. Their high thermal conduc tivities minimize thermal gradients and resulting thermal stresses. Narloy A is a copper-silver alloy with thermal conductivity equivalent to pure copper, but with moderately high strength to 800F. Narloy-Z, with a zirconium addition, improves ductility and fa tigue life, and extends the operating range to 1000F. These alloys are available in the cast as well as wrought form. Copper alloys also serve as electrical conductors, conductive springs, and bearings and bushings.

Nickel-Base Alloys

Nickel-base alloys comprise some 65% of the weight of the Space Shuttle Main Engine. These alloys de rive their widespread usage in rocket engines from superior corrosion resistance, high-temperature oxi dation resistance, retention of useful properties over a wide temperature range, and, in many cases, very unique physical properties. The nickel-base alloys can be divided into three groups, based on applica tion.

The first group---nickel-base alloys used mainly for superior corrosion resistance--include Nickel 200, the monel alloys, Inconel 600, Inconel 625, and elec tro-deposited (ED) nickel. Inherently corrosion-re sistant, nickel does not depend upon a metastable passive film for protection; and, being strongly elec tronegative, it is not susceptible to galvanic corrosion when in contact with most other metals. Monels, al loys of nickel and copper, besides having good cor rosion resistance, have useful magnetic properties at cryogenic temperature and high resistance to igni tion in oxygen. The Inconel alloys, composed of nickel-chromium-iron, resist oxidation at tempera tures up to 1800F.

The second group, the nickel-base superalloys, re tain high strength at elevated temperatures. Alloy
718, the workhorse of this group, has high strength up to 1300F, good cryogenic ductility, and good weld ability. Fine-grained material should be specified for



APPENDIX C 401

parts to be electron-beam-welded. Higher-tempera ture applications exploit Rene' 41, Waspaloy, and MAR-M-246.

The third group, the special-application alloys, includes Nichrome (for electrical-resistance heating elements), chromel and alumel (for thermocouples), and Incoloys and Invar (for low-thermal-expansion applications).

All of the nickel-base alloys resist corrosion and stress corrosion and are oxygen-compatible, but are susceptible to hydrogen-environment embrittlement
(HEE) at temperatures above -200F. HEE in nickel base alloys can be prevented by avoiding plastic strains or, this being impractical, by providing a pro tective barrier, such as electroplating with copper or gold or overlaying by weld deposition with a nonsus ceptible alloy.

Cobalt Alloys

Cobalt-base alloys, like nickel alloys, offer excellent high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Unlike the nickel alloys, cobalt alloys are immune to HEE.

Alloy 188, a corrosion- and heat-resistant alloy, exhibits outstanding oxidation and creep resistance up to 2100F. Although not hardenable by heat treatment, 188 has moderate room-temperature strength and good cryogenic properties. It also has good resistance to corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking and can be readily welded, including by electron-beam welding.

Elgiloy, a cobalt-base alloy, has found widespread usage for springs. The alloy has high strength and good corrosion resistance, and is nonmagnetic. Elgiloy derives its strength from a combination of heat treatment and cold work. It has a maximum use temperature of approximately 700F.

Titanium Alloys

Titanium alloys possess high strength-to-weight ratios and good toughness, as well as excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. However, titanium alloys are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement at temperatures above -ll0F, and are not compatible with gaseous or liquid oxygen or with red fuming nitric acid, at any temperature. Titanium alloys also are incompatible with the products of combustion from many propellants; these factors limit their usefulness in liquid-propellant rocket en gine systems. They can be applied, however, in fuel systems involving propellants such as liquid hydro gen, monomethyl hydrazine (MMH), and kerosene
(RP-1). They also are compatible, under certain cir cumstances, with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO). Titanium alloys have found use in liquid-propellant rocket en gine systems for pump impellers and inducers, valve bodies, pump housings, high-pressure fuel ducts, hy draulic tubing, pressure bottles, struts, gimbal blocks, propellant-storage bottles, and nozzles.

The most demanding applications have been for use at cryogenic temperatures, where titanium alloys offer some of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of presently available engineering materials. Two tita nium alloys are most commonly used at cryogenic temperatures: Ti-5AI-2.5Sn ELI and Ti-6A1-4V ELI. In the ELI (extra-low interstitial) grade of these alloys, good cryogenic toughness is achieved by controlling the interstitial elements oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen, and the substitutional element iron, to much lower than normal levels. Typically, Ti-6AI-4V ELI is used to -320F while the higher-toughness Ti 5AI-2.5Sn ELI is used as low as -423F. However, Ti 6AI-4V ELI can be employed at -423F if the compo nent design compensates for its lower ductility and toughness.

Titanium and titanium alloys are classified into three major categories according to the predominant phases present in their microstructure: alpha, alpha beta, and beta alloys. Although non-heat-treatable, alpha alloys offer high toughness, are more oxida tion-resistant than alpha-beta or beta alloys, are us able up to about 1000F, and are relatively difficult to form. Ti-5AI-2.5Sn is an example of an alpha alloy. Alpha-beta alloys, such as Ti-6AI-4V, are heat-treat able to higher-strength levels, are usable to 800F and in some instances to 1000F, and are somewhat more formable than alpha alloys. However, alpha-beta al loys ordinarily would not be used in the fully-heat treated condition because its heat-treat response is limited to relatively thin sections (--1.0 in.) and its fracture toughness decreases significantly with in creasing strength level. Beta alloys are generally quite formable at room temperature, are usable up to approximately 600"F, and are heat-treatable to rela tively high strength (e.g., -190 ksi) in thick sections while still retaining good toughness. The disadvan tages of beta alloys are a higher density, lower oxida tion resistance and lower toughness at cryogenic temperatures. Examples of beta alloys include Ti 10V-2Fe-3AI, Ti-3AI-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr, and Ti-15V-3AI 3Cr-3Sn.

Most titanium alloys can be welded, although welding requires the hardware to be thoroughly clean and the operation to be performed in a high-purity inert gas (Ar, He) or vacuum. Titanium and titanium alloys are available as sheet, strip, plate, bar, forgings, extrusions, tubing, and castings.

Thermoplastic Materials

Thermoplastics, polymeric materials that can be formed or reformed by melting or softening with heat, serve well as electrical insulation and seals. They include fluorocarbons, nylon, polycarbonate, and amide-imide materials. Of these, the fluorocar bon polymers find the greatest number of applica tions in liquid-propellant rocket engine design. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene
(Kef-F) with or without fillers or reinforcing fibers find extensive use in rocket engines for seals and coatings for seals due to the compatibility of these materials with oxygen and their properties in both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

rubber materials noted in Fig. C-1 that find extensive use in O-ring seals, gasket-type seals, electrical insula tion, vibration dampers, etc. These materials are also used for adhesives, sealants, formed-in-place seals, and potting of electrical components.

Nitrile rubbers find considerable use because re sistant to oxidation and hydraulic fluids. They do not take a permanent set for long periods of time. Consequently, these rubbers find much use in O-ring seals of hydraulic and pneumatic components.

Silicone rubber, an extensively used sealant and potting compound, has been exploited primarily due to its ease of application and wide usable-tempera ture range of-165-500F. Fluorocarbon rubber is used when  the application requires compatibility with oxygen or when the use temperature is in the range of 300-375F.

Special designs may call for other elastomers, with unique properties. For example, resin-cured butyl has been found to provide excellent seals in NTO and/or hydrazine for short periods (i.e., under one hour).

C a r b o n s  and  Ceramics

Pressed-carbon materials and various ceramics find use in throat inserts for ablative engines, dynamic seals of gas-turbine drives of turbopumps, and coat ings to protect metals from high-temperature gases.

C o m p o s i t e s

A composite has a matrix materal reinforced in ran dom or oriented form with a special fiber, tape, fab ric, etc. Examples would be glass-fiber-filled polyte trafluoroethylene (PTFE), tape-wrapped ablative plas tics, fabric-reinforced epoxy sheets, filament-wound thrust-chamber shells, etc. Composites find a wide range of uses in liquid-propellant rocket engine de sign, such as in seals, thrust-chamber structure, elec trical printed wiring-boards, and ball-bearing separa tors. The matrix may be carbon, metallic, polymeric, or ceramic. Three types of composites might be dis tringuished: structural plastics, ablatives, and carbon carbon composites.

Structural  p las t ics .  Choice of thermosetting resin such as an epoxy, phenolic, or polyimide for fabricating a laminate will depend upon the thermal and adhesive properties required. Epoxy resins offer high adhesive strength, but are more severely limited in maximum use-temperatures. Other resins such as the phenolics or polyimides have very good high temperature characteristics, but at the expense of lowered adhesion and greater fabrication difficulties.



APPENDIX C 403

Reinforcements used in t h e  laminated structure may take the form of layers of fabric, random place ment  of short fibers, or very precise placement of continuous filaments through the use of filament winding or lay-up of collimated tapes. The exact type and form of reinforcement will depend upon the mechanical properties that are to be derived from it. For example,  a cover requiring low mechanical strength and rigidity might be made of random fibers of glass sprayed onto a form with the resin added simultaneously, while a structural shell for a small thrust chamber might well be produced by fil ament-winding a resin-preimpregnated graphite so as to produce a structure with high strength and rigidity.

Ablat ives .  Rocket ablat ives~materials  that can
"sacrificially" cool a thrust chamber or nozz le~usu ally are fabric-reinforced phenolic or rubber-modi fied-phenolic laminated materials. The reinforcing fabric is placed in the formed structure at some pre determined angle to the expected flow of the hot gas. The matrix material and the reinforcing material are each selected for performance with the propellants to be used and the duty cycle of the thrust chamber or nozzle.

The phenolic or rubber-modified-phenolic resins have found the greatest use. They offer a high-tem perature-resistant matrix with predictable properties when exposed to the hot gas of the rocket engine. They form a structural char and provide a cooling gas at the hot surface as they pyrolize. The use of rubber modification yields a somewhat  lower abla tion rate, but keeps the structure from delaminating.

Reinforcements for ablative componen ts  will usually be selected on the basis of the oxidizer. Oxygen-based oxidizers demand the use of a fiber re inforcement that will not oxidize and that has a high melting point plus high viscosity when melted, such as silica glass and quartz, which tend to protect the char from oxidizing rapidly even though there is a high percentage of water vapor in the combustion gases of the thrust chamber. A fluorine-based oxi dizer develops the combustion products that rapidly attack quartz and other glass, forming fibrous materi als. This propellant demands reinforcements of car bon or graphite.

Carbon-carbon compos i tes .  Carbon-carbon compos i t e s~mate r i a l s  with some type of amor phous-carbon matrix reinforced by fibrous carbon or g raph i t e~ f ind  use as thermal shields and nozzle extensions. In all of the uses associated with liquid propellant rocket engine design, these composites have been coated with some form of silicon carbide
(with or without glass formers) to prevent oxidation.

Adhesives

Polymeric and ceramic materials are also used in adhesive applications on rocket engines. In general, silicones are used for sealants and bonding applica tions requiring good peel-strength at temperatures in the range o f - 1 6 5  - 500F; epoxies for high bond shear-strength from -65F to as high as 350F; epoxy phenolics for good bond shear-strength from liquid helium temperature  to 500F; and polyurethanes when bonding must be done with contact pressure without elevated-temperature cure and the material must exhibit good peel and shear strength at a cryo genic temperature. Pressure-sensitive-adhesives hav ing a natural rubber base find use on tapes where the adhesive must be completely removed with the tape.

Lubricants Although some hydrocarbon lubricants used for rocket engines typify those for automotive purposes
(i.e., gear cases), most will have to be selected on the basis of propellant compatibility. As a result, few greases or oils are used. If needed, a grease will usu ally be based on a fluorocarbon oil. Because most oils and greases become brittle at cryogenic temper atures, dry-film lubrication is most often used, the lu bricant usually being pure molybdenum disulfide powder  sprayed onto the component surfaces with some binding agent (usually a resin if a fuel envi ronment or a phosphate material if oxidizer).

Platings, Surface Finishes, Coatings

Components are sometimes given a surface finish to assure corrosion resistance. It can be applied either by electroplating or by an electrolysis process, a chemical film, or a paint. Coatings are also used to give a soft chemical-resistant sealing surface to pres sure-assisted seals.

Chromium and nickel are examples of plating materials commonly used. An anodized surface is an example of a chemical-conversion coating. Zinc or strontium chromate-containing paints are commonly used to protect a variety of metals against corrosion.

Many alloys protect against corrosion with an ox ide film. To assure the formation of this film, the component will often be given a chemical treatment
("passivated") to assure formation of the protective oxide.

W e i g h t  C o n s i d e r a t i o n s

The importance of rocket vehicle propulsion system weight to the achievement of the required velocity increment with a given payload wieght is presented in this appendix.

As was seen with residual propellants, excessive dead weight at burnout imposes penalties. Whenever rocket engines can be made lighter without compro mising reliability and structural integrity, the payoff in range and payload will therefore be sizable. Engine and vehicle builders usually distinguish sev eral types of engine weight:

Dry weight. The net weight of the engine as it leaves the factory.

Burnout weight. Engine dry weight plus residual, measurable propellants remaining in the engine at cutoff. In a typical engine design, burnout weight may be 4% higher than dry weight. Burnout weight plays importantly in vehicle mass ratio (Eq. 1-30).

Wet weight. The engine dry weight plus all pro pellant within it, during main stage. In a typical design, engine wet weight may be 6% higher than dry weight. Wet weight significantly affects vehicle in flight center of gravity and moments of inertia.

Wet gimballed weight. This portion of wet weight represents engine mass gimballed for steering purposes. In earlier designs this meant essentially the thrust-chamber and injector wet-weight. In later designs it often refers to the entire engine less a rel atively small amount of stationary parts. This weight affects gimbal actuator loads and response char acteristics of the guidance control loop.

Ideally, dry weight and burnout weight should be equal; that is, no propellants should be trapped in the engine at shutdown. In practice, this will not al ways be possible. However, the engine designer can do much to bring it about through proper design, sizing and routing of lines, avoidance of traps, and location of valves.

Because of the importance of weight control, rocket-engine manufacturers employ "engineers specifically in charge of this area. Table A-1 shows a typical weight progress form, as used by the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International. It is revised and reissued periodically. Thus it becomes a useful tool to raise early warnings of a trend to overweight. The arbitrary example shows a slight underweight. However, the table also shows the data to be based almost entirely on estimated and cal culated figures, rather than on actual weighing results. This is characteristic for the earlier phases of design and development of a rocket engine. More often than not, the weight advantage will disappear gradually as the design firms up; then the squeeze will be on. For convenient display of the weight tenden cies over time, a graph like Fig. A-1 will be useful.

The weight changes of the various components as well as of the entire engine affect centers of gravity and moments of inertia. Through issue of a data sheet like Fig. A-2, all parties concerned can be kept informed on changes as they occur.

Note that the data presented in Table A-1 and Fig. A-1 and A-2 concern the 150,000-1b A-2 Stage engine system, a part of an assumed multistage space vehicle configuration.

Consider the influence of structural weight on the performance and gross takeoff weight of a rocket vehicle, and how its magnitude varies with the design parameters of different vehicle systems. The quan titative relationships will be evaluated individually for each case.

Equation (1-30) can be rewritten for the stage burnout velocity of a single-stage vehicle or the stage velocity increment of any individual stage of a multistage vehicle system, as follows:

APPENDIX A 39 1

For a given burnout velocity these equations show an even weight tradeoff between stage engine system weight and stage payload weight. The weight of all other items being kept constant, a pound decrease in the stage engine-system weight will increase the stage payload capacity by one pound.

For a fixed payload, and assuming other items except engine weight to be constant, the relation be tween the stage velocity increment Vbo and stage en gine-system weight for a given system can be written as follows:

k(~22 + Stage engine system weight'~
Vbo = klln + Stage engine system ~ )

(A-3)

where kl = Cvcg(Is)oa = constant k2 = Stage payload weight + Stage residual-pro pellant weight at burnout + Stage structure, guidance and other weight = constant k 3 = Stage usable-propellant weight + k2 = con stant

Since k2 < k 3, the denominator will decrease more rapidly than the numerator, with decreasing engine weight. Thus fixed payloads increase burnout ve locity, which will pay off in longer range or higher orbit.

For a given burnout velocity and for a fixed payload, the required Stage average overall specific impulse (Is)oa in terms of Stage engine-system weight can be established as follows:

(k 3 + System engine system weight'~
(Is)oa = k4/ln ~ k2 + St-~ge ~ sys---~-emem ~ )

(A-4)

where-- Vbo k4 - Cvcg - constant

Equation (A-4) shows that the overall-specific-im pulse requirements decrease with decreasing engine system weight.

The "growth factor" of a rocket vehicle also il lustrates the importance of weight. If the weight of a component increases, for instance, the designer can adjust for this by increasing the propellant load and thus possibly that of other components, such as a pump, to maintain the same required vehicle per formance--i.e. ,  payload and vehicle trajectory. If one part of the vehicle system exceeds its weight allotment by one pound, the total vehicle system weight at takeoff will see a certain number of ad ditional pounds. Growth factor is defined as the total vehicle-system (including payload) weight increase at takeoff divided by the causal increment of added inert and/or payload weight. Growth factor for a given vehicle system will not be a precise value, but rather vary within a band. For instance, a small weight increase of a component in an existing system may only require the addition of a corresponding small amount of propellant, but not require enlarge ment of the tanks, valves, etc.; then the growth factor will be small. In another case, the weight increase may be "the straw that breaks the camel's back," re quiring the use of the next-larger valve, duct, or the like; the growth factor will then be large.

In general, growth factor gives the designer a useful tool during the early steps to an engine system, because it attaches a tangible value to the importance of the engine-system weight. A systems-weight in crease may be considered "uninvited payload." For single-stage vehicles, and relatively small weight changes, the value of the growth factor then can be expressed with sufficient accuracy as follows:

Total vehicle system Growth factor = weight at takeoff

Payload weight (A-5)

For any stage of a multistage vehicle, the approx imate value of the growth factors against total ve hicle-system weight at takeoff can be expressed as follows:

Growth factor =

Total vehicle system weight at takeoff

Stage payload weight (A-6)

The growth factors of any stage against the vehicle system weight at ignition of the same or lower stage can be expressed as follows:

Vehicle system weight at same or lower stage ignition Growth factor = (A-7)

Stage payload weight

Sample Calculation

A three-stage rocket has the following weight data:
total vehicle-system weight at takeoff, 40,000 lb.;
vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition, 7500
lb; vehicle system at third-stage ignition, 2200 lb;
payload weight, 700 lb.

P r o b l e m

For each pound increase of engine-system weight of first, second, and third stages, respectively, determine
(at a constant vehicle performance) (a)  increases of total vehicle-system weight at takeoff, and ( b )
increases of vehicle-system weight at second- and third-stage ignition.

Solution:

(a) Payload weight of first stage = vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition = 7500 lb; pay load weight of second stage = vehicle-system weight at third-stage ignition = 2200 lb; payload weight of third stage = actual system payload weight -- 700 lb.



392 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

From Eq. (A-6):

1) Growth factor of first stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
m

First-stage payload weight 7,500 - 5.86

2) Growth factor of second stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
Second-stage payload weight - 2,200 - 2 0

3) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system takeoff weight:

Vehicle system takeoff weight 44,000
Third-stage payload weight - 700 - 62.9

Therefore.

1) For each pound increase of first-stage engine system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 5.86 lb.

2) For each pound increase of second-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 20 lb.

3) For each pound increase of third-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system takeoff weight will be 62.9 lb.

Co) Note that the weight growth of lower stages will not affect the upper-stage weight growth. For an increase of first-stage vehicle-system weight, there will be no weight changes on second and third stages; and for an increase on second stage vehicle system weight, no weight change will be required for the third stage. From Eq.
(a-7)"

1) Growth factor vehicle-system ignition:

of second stage against weight  at second-stage

Vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition 7,500

Second-stage payload weight 2,200 - ~ =  3 . 4 1

2) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition:

Vehicle system weight at second-stage ignition 7,500

m

Third-stage payload weight 700 - 10.72

3) Growth factor of third stage against vehicle system weight at third-stage ignition:

Vehicle system weight at third-stage ignition 2,200

Third-stage payload weight 700 - 3 . 1 4

Therefore.

1) For each pound increase of second-stage en gine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition will be 3.41 lb.

2), 3) For each pound increase of third-stage engine-system weight, the increase on vehicle-system weight at second-stage ignition will be 10.72 lb and the increase on vehicle-system weight at third-stage ignition will be 3.14 lb.

The correctness of results can be checked by recombining the individual stage growth factors to obtain the growth factor for the entire vehicle system:

3.14 x 3.41 x 5.86 = 62.9



Appendix B

Reliability Considerat ions

The effort to increase reliability in rocket engines should span the entire program spectrum from con ceptual design through production. The reliability ef fort can basically be split into three parts: preven tion of failures, process assessment and control, and monitoring of performance. Reliability through pre vention involves early involvement of reliability en gineers in "concurrent engineering" design and de velopment loops to identify high-risk devices and de signs and catastrophic failure modes. Both before and during fabrication and fielding of hardware, po tential process faults and their effects should be eval uated and controlled to assure expected reliability performance through a "Continuous Process Im p rovement  (CPI)" approach.  The cont inuous monitoring of performance needs to be organized in a formal way (e.g., Reliability Growth or Reliability Demonstration Test Monitoring) to assure identifica tion and correction of possible faults.

Reliability in Design

The reliability contribution to a concurrent engineer ing effort should be through assessment of past per formance of similar-type hardware to identify high failure-risk components or approaches in the pro posed designs, conducting reliability-optimization trade studies, and correlating past "lessons learned"
in rocket-engine-specific systems. Potential process inadequacies should be addressed, with considera tion for control of a process or designing in "fault tolerance." For example, process-induced contam ination may be a problem largely solvable by en largement of flow passages in the engine systems.

Another aspect of reliability in design, so-called
"simplicity," usually will contribute significantly to higher reliability. Parts which do not fulfill a truly useful purpose should be omitted; this may include many so-called safety features and interlocking de vices, which often cause more trouble than they pre vent. Early designs of liquid-propellant rocket en gines indeed often suffered from an overdose of so phistication and safety devices. Many of the more recent designs have been substantially improved in this area. Simplifications, like all other design fea tures, must be carefully planned and evaluated. Simplification by elimination of a useful component must not become an excuse for failure to improve that component if its absence could severely penalize other subsystems or maintenance and servicing pro cedures.

The counterpoint to simplicity will be redun dancy. Occasionally, the reliability of certain types of parts are inherently too low or the consequences of the failure effect are too great to accept. Then a redundant  functional architecture may be consid er_ed, in which complexity, in terms of more parts, will be increased to achieve a higher reliability. The additional cost, weight, and failure modes must be

393

weighed against the reduction in probability of the failure mode of concern. Man-rated systems typi cally have the additional requirement to isolate phys ically the redundant element from its sister element to assure protection from common causes of failure
(e.g., contamination, heat, vibration, explosion, etc.). Additionally, the operational status of each element of the redundancy may have to be monitored to as sure its existence before flight.

For instance, to avoid a troublesome sealed con nection it may be decided to omit flanges and seals and to weld it. However, if one of the lines thus con nected were inadvertently pinched in the field, it would be necessary to remove the entire engine from the vehicle under preparation for launchmmagnify ing a simple replacement into a major operation. To be sure, welding or preferably brazing may indeed be the best solution for many problem connections. The point is, this will not be true for all connections. The design team must carefully analyze all aspects of the system including handling and, in particular, mis handling by the user.

As another example, tests may have shown that an engine could readily be set up and calibrated to specifications by means of orifices, eliminating pre viously used regulators. Engines get delivered ac cordingly. With rocket engines, it is entirely normal that many months,' if not several years, may elapse between delivery and final use. Much can happen during this period. Changes in mission plans, for in stance, may have made another thrust level more de sirable. Then, suddenly, an adjustment by means of orifices, in particular its verification, becomes a ma jor operation. Omission of a strategic regulator was indeed an engine simplification, but for the vehicle system it turned out to be a complication. The point, again: careful evaluation of a planned omission must consider all aspects, including changes of plans.

Reliability Assurance

The emphasis on reliability must not become an empty slogan. Fortunately, the rocket-engine de signer has certain means to achieve the highest de gree of reliability. One of these is an effective
"failure report ing and corrective action system
(FRACAS)" during the monitoring of hardware test activities. Testing of all hardware should be moni tored in an organized and regimented fashion to as sure identification and resolution of hardware design and processing failures. The design~ should, at the very least, implement a fundamental FRACAS loop. This may be supplemented with a "reliability growth"
assessment program to appraise regularly the pro gress of the engine system toward the expected reliability performance. In many cases, a "reliability demonstration" test program may be proposed to determine, with "confidence," the final reliability per formance of the engine system.



394 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES

D e f i n i t i o n s

The definitions used in rocket-engine reliability pro grams vary widely with individual program require ments, with the object under design and develop ment, and with the missions contemplated. The def initions given below typify usage in actual rocket en gine programs, and can be readily adapted to others. For the sake of clarity, irrelevant jargon and detail have been omitted.

Reliability. The probability that a part or sys tem will function properly and, if necessary, repeat edly under  rated operating conditions, within the specified load and time limits.

Mission success. Completion of the rocket-en gine mission objectives within specified tolerances. All subsystems contribute to the success. It is an in herent characteristic of mission-success analysis and assurance that they anticipate the probability of cer tain part and subsystem malfunctions, offsetting them with appropriate countermeasures (such as redun dancies, emergency power sources, power and pro pellant reserves, etc.).

Mission failure. Failure of the rocket engine to produce the required thrust for the specified time to complete the mission objectives. Mission failures can be classified as catastrophic, premature shut down, and "deferred."

Catas t roph ic  f a i l u r e  (Cri t ical i ty  I ) .  An
"uncontained" failure in which the effects propagate beyond the physical envelope of the engine system, with sufficient energy potential likely to propagate failure to adjacent systems. It is important to assess and discriminate this type of failure from a prema ture shutdown for crew safety in manned vehicles and for mission success in multi-engine unmanned vehi cles (if engine out is a viable mode of operation).

Premature  shutdown (Criticality 11). A fail ure in which the effects are contained and degrade performance enough to trigger an engine shutdown. In multi-engined vehicles with "engine-out" capa bility, the discrimination between catastrophic failure and premature shutdown figures importantly in the criteria for vehicle mission success.

Deferred  fa i lure  (Criticality III). A failure causing generally slow-acting and minor perfor mance degradation in which continued operation of the engine is a consideration. Action to cope with the failure will be deferred to allow analysis by the pi lot or an automatic logic, to decide whether correc tive action can be taken or an abort sequence should

be initiated. Typical example: shutting off an engine in a four-engine airplane and reaching destination safely, although with a delay. Analogous provisions are anticipated for manned rockets.

Man-rating. Design and operational provisions to assure crew survival even in case of mission failure. Thus, man-rated crew reliability typically exceeds mission reliability. For instance, overall vehicle reli ability to achieve mission success may be 95%. By the addition of an escape mechanism, man-rated re liability may be increased to 99.5%. Caution is ad vised not to become entirely "wrapped up" in man rating at the expense of mission reliability. A single launch of a man-carrying space vehicle costs several hundred million dollars, all told. Investment in means to save the mission as well as the man, there fore, appears to be prudent. Table B-1 illustrates this clearly. Pressing optimum reliability for spacecraft and launch vehicle, including the engines, therefore minimizes the need for a crew-escape system.

Engine out.  Design and operational provisions in a multi-engine system to permit limited or com plete mission continuance in case one engine fails to fire or malfunctions and gets shut down. This option can notably improve system reliability since one of the engines is a redundant element.

Failure mode. The specific manner in which a part or system malfunctions. This may be a "short"
or "open" circuit, an incorrectly "closed" or "open"
valve, an engine out, or similar malfunction.

Order o f  failure. The number  of components in a system that would have to fail, regardless of their failure mode, to cause a system or mission failure. First-order failures derive from malfunction of a sin gle component  or part (i.e., "single-point" failure). Second- and higher-order failures are defined in a like manner. Typical example: a stuck pressurizing valve causing overpressure in a vessel would rupture it only if the safety valve failed to open; this would be second-order failure. However, continuous venting of a properly opening vent valve may prematurely de plete the gas supply. A thorough failure-effect analy sis will reveal all ramifications. In the example, de pletion would not occur instantaneously; this would be "deferred" failure. The designer can do some thing about it in advance, such as by giving the pilot an overriding closing valve that remains completely inactive when not needed (al though--not  a complete blessingmthis adds weight).

Failure modes and effects analysis. An or derly, hardware-based analysis listing all credible modes in which components or parts of a system can fail, the effects of the failures on the engine's or vehi cle's ability to complete the mission, and the order of the failures. Such an analysis should distinguish between the prelaunch, launch, and cutoff phases. All identified failure modes should be classified as catas trophic, premature shutdown, or "deferred." This hardware-to-effect approach assures that all notable pieces of hardware will be addressed and assessed.

Fault-tree analysis. An event-based analysis that targets specific failure-effect scenarios and then lists all the hardware malfunctions in a graphical, hi erarchical "tree" (a reverse of the hardware-to-effect approach of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis).



APPENDIX B 395

Emergency detection system (EDS). T h e EDS comprises the electromechanical devices, in cluding sensors and discriminators, to detect an im minent malfunction. Depending on the type of fail ure  ( ca t a s t roph ic ,  p r e m a t u r e  s h u t d o w n ,  or
"deferred"), it may initiate immediate action, or defer but store and/or  display it in a suitable manner
(timer, visual gage, or light). Inputs to the EDS must be analyzed, selected, and provided by the designer
(in particular, the engine designer) at the outset.

Noncomplex redundancy. The simultaneous function of identical equipment.  Application de pends upon the particular failure mode to be elimi nated. For a typical example, see Fig. B-1 and B-2. Other examples include dual (series) seals and paral lel valves.

Complex redundancy. The original function carried out by one component. Failure sensors, logic circuits, and switching devices energize an identical standby component,  when needed. The advantages obtained can be completely offset by the additional complexity of sensing and switching circuitry. The potential problem area may be merely shifted from the equipment to the failure-detection components. However, this standby redundancy may be advanta geous for long mission times (e.g., days or weeks)
where it may be undesirable also to subject the backup equipment to prolonged operation. A typical example: electric-power emergency battery with volt age sensor and switchover circuitry.

Failure Modes of Engine Components

Failure of a rocket-engine component  may be at tributed to basically three causes: functional, struc tural, and process faults. They have the following principal modes: functional failures, fatigue failures, overstress and overstrain, failures pertaining to com bustion devices, failures pertaining to electrical devices, manufacturing and material defects, unex plained failures, human error, and manufacturing of field-processing faults.

Functional failures. Something other than structural failure can cause malfunction of parts or components.  For instance, an "0" ring may fail to seal due to improper groove depth specified in the design; or a plunger may freeze in the bore of a guid ing bushing, because of improper  surface finish and/or  noncompatibility of materials. The following precautions will minimize possible function failures in the design of engine components:

 Choose proven designs with an established service record.

 Use standard mechanical elements (bolts, nuts, threads, gears, pins, rivets, springs, seals, tube fittings, pistons, keys, shafts, bearings) wherever possible.

 Select simple designs, but without impairing flexibility. In particular, minimize the number of moving parts and sealing surfaces.

 Allow adequate functional margins in the de sign of components (spring forces, actuating powers, supply of lubricants, supply of coolants).

 Subject newly designed parts to extensive func tional testing, under simulated working and environ mental conditions, before "freezing" the final config uration.

 Provide redundancy, a "buddy plan": where one component would be sufficient, provide two of the same type. If one fails, the other takes over. This can be achieved in two ways: by noncomplex and by complex redundancy. Intelligently applied, redun dancy can significantly increase reliability.

 Pursue a rigorous program of continuous product improvement.

Fatigue failures. Fatigue failures are fractures caused by repeated loading at stresses considerably lower than those causing failure by a single load. They are the most common type of mechanical fail ure. The ability of a part to resist fatigue failure can not be checked without destroying the part. Checking is possible, however, through destructive endurance tests with representative samples selected at random.

Most fatigue failures start with a crack at or near an outside surface because stresses are apt to be greatest there. The actual failure will result from gradual propagation of these cracks.

The starting point for a crack will depend upon the geometry of the part and on surface conditions. Any notch or other stress-raiser, being a point of high stress concentration, may start fatigue cracks. Fillet radii too small, threads, oil holes, keyways and similar surface irregularities all present  po ten t i a l sources of fatigue failure. Although a part may be de signed to be free of geometric irregularities, having no shoulders, grooves or the like, it may still contain a great number of minute stress-raisersmtool marks, scratches, identification stamp marks, or various in herent discontinuities in the material itself, such as inclusions of foreign matter and quenching cracks.

The design engineer should make every effort to avoid stress concentrations in a highly stressed part subject to repeated loads. In the design, rigid speci fications should be called out for surface finishes. To carry repeated loads, forgings are usually preferable to castings, and ductile materials to material prone to become brittle. Welded joints see almost every type of stress concentration and fatigue failure. Wherever



396 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT R O C K E T  ENGINES possible, welded joints should be minimized in the design of parts subject to repeated loads. Rigid pro cedures for welding and inspection must be called out in the design.

O v e r s t r e s s  a n d  overs t ra in .  Stress analysis in mechanical design to prevent overstress and over strain was discussed in section 2.5.3. The interrela tionship of stress and reliability of mechanical parts
(as illustrated simplistically in Fig. B-3) can be evalu ated probabilistically.

Two stress levels exist for every part in a given engine component: the working stress and the dam aging stress at which failure occurs. The failure may be either a fracture or a deformation beyond allow able tolerances. Either will be a mean value of a dis tribution about a mean. The difference between the working and the damaging stress mean values indi cates the stress reliability margin of the part.

Deviations from the mean working stress mainly reflect variations in the dimensions of the part and operational and environmental conditions. The dis tribution about the mean damaging stress results from variations in material properties, fabrication processes, quality control, and maintenance prac tices. The area Pf, where the two distributions over lap, represents the probabil i ty of failure (unre liability).

Close control of functional and environmental loads may decrease the variation of the working stress about the mean. Likewise, better materials and strict quality control should increase the damaging stress mean value and decrease the variation about the mean. Thus, the area of overlap may be substan tially reduced or el iminated,  and reliability in creased.

Under certain transient or unstable conditions, such as engine start or stop, combustion instability or abrupt pressure surges may cause a failure; see Chapter 4, "Design of Thrust Chambers and Other Combustion Devices."

Elec t r ica l  f a i l u r e s .  Although predominant ly an assembly of mechanical parts, a modern rocket engine employs a number of electrical devices with out which it cannot function reliably. Electrical components used most widely include power sources
(batteries), converters (dc to ac), microprocessors, tranducers, wires and harnesses, connectors, switches, relays (electromechanical  and solid-state), timers, pressure switches, diodes, solenoid valves, servomo tors, and position indicators.

All of these devices represent, to some degree, a potential source of failure, the consequences of which can be just as detrimental as failure of mechanical parts. By proper design and assembly instructions, by careful select ion of the elements,  and by Environmental Stress Screening (ESS), the designer can forestall electrical failures and thus assure overall system reliability. Common points of electrical fail ure include the following:

 Cold-solder spots in connectors, wirings, and electrical elements. They often cause sporadic dis continuities, particularly under vibration.

 Short circuits in wirings, connectors, and other electrical devices. This may be due to poor design, leaving insufficient separation between connector pins, lugs, and the like; or to excessive solder; or damaged insulation due to poor harness installation, chafing under vibration, and poor handling; or over load and/or  overheating in solenoids, moisture in connectors, etc.

 Fused relay contacts, due to overload and/or incorrect current rating of the elements.

 Relay and switch contact-loss under vibration. This is really an electromechanical malfunction. It can be prevented by proper relay selection, shock mounting, orientation of installation, or replacement by solid-state circuitry.

 Power failure resulting from one or more of the causes listed above. Preventions include emer gency batteries and overload switches, combined with subcircuit isolation through diodes.

A liquid-propellant rocket engine usually includes additional electrical elements as required for instru mentat ion and te lemetry-- ins t rumenta t ion  power supplies, end organs (sensors, pickups, thermocou pies, accelerometers ,  position indicators), signal conditioners (analog-to-digital), wiring, and the like. Although, as a rule, instrumentation does not directly effect proper functioning of the engine system, its failure may indirectly cause engine malfunction, by interfering with its operation. For instance, a pres sure pickup may rupture and cause premature deple tion of a gas supply; the same event in the fuel system may cause an engine-compartment fire; improper in stallation of a thermocouple may block a vital lubri cant or other line.



APPENDIX B 397

The engine designer's task includes engine in strumentation. It is obvious that this peripheral sys tem, too, will require his full attention.

Manufacturing and material  defects. The producibility of parts directly affects the reliability of components. Manufacturing and material defects can be prevented only by strict process and quality control. The areas of quality control may be subdi vided as follows:

 Materials inspection.  The extent of inspec tion and testing of raw materials depends upon the nature of the part for which they will be used. Inspection of materials includes testing for composi tion, uniformity, mechanical properties, fabrication and heat-treating characteristics, and possibly other properties, as the application may demand.

 Traceability. By the time a materials defect is detected, many more parts may have been made from the same lot or batch of raw material. If accu rate records have been kept on parts for which num bered material lots have been used, it will be possi ble, without a "panic," to withdraw and replace all parts made from the faulty lot. The importance of accurate and complete records is obvious.

 Process inspection. This refers to all shop in spections made of parts as they are being processed. It in effect checks the performance of the operators and tools or equipment, and sorts out faulty parts as soon as errors are detected.

 Salvage. Someone decides whether defective materials or parts can be corrected or must be scrapped.

 Final inspection. This inspection covers the completed component  parts to ensure they come within the limits required by the design.

 Checking o f  ac tual  service performance.  This includes investigation of complaints and studies of actual service performance of the part in the engine system (see "Failure-Reporting System").

R e l i a b i l i t y  d e m o n s t r a t i o n .  This is a strict, re liability test series in which the "matured" engine sys tem configuration is repeatedly tested in the same configuration and mission cycle. The primary objec tive is to statistically determine the reliability per formance level and confidence limits for the engine configuration.

R e l i a b i l i t y - g r o w t h  m o n i t o r i n g .  This is typi cally a monitoring and assessment task over engi neering development  test programs to continually assess the development (i.e., "growth") in the reliabil ity performance of an engine system. Early successes and failures are plotted to continually check for the expected improvements through corrective actions and process improvements.

H u m a n  error. Experience with early manned rocket flights showed that certain functions could be performed better by trained men than by automatic devices. It appears certain that future spaceflight will employ combinations of automatic and manual sys tems, the ratio of the two depending on mission re quirements. Even unmanned missions, ostensibly fully automatic, have people directly involved during launch preparations and through postlaunch com mands for trajectory-correction maneuvers, informa tion playback, and similar actions.

As recent nuclear powerplant catastrophes attest, even a fully trained, possible very alert individual can be subject to error. He may commit an error at a desk while using a computer, or while connecting a number of hydraulic lines, or under stress while push ing buttons. The history of rocketry ~ is full of glaring examples. Whenever it happens, the most eloquent regrets are probably voiced by the designers of the system involved: If someone had not done some thing to their perfect creation, it would have worked faultlessly. The reaction is understandable,  but wrong.

For whatever reason a system failed, it obviously was not perfect. Its designer did not consider human nature, non-ideal operating conditions, or emergency situations. Clear and complete drawings, specifica tions, and other written instructions are important, but they will not prevent, by themselves, human er rors, because they can be misplaced, misread, or not read at all.

It is not surprising that the elimination of human error, or more positively, the perfection of the inte gration of man with the machine, is becoming an in dependent branch of engineering. It would be be yond the scope of this book to go into the details of
"Human Engineering" or "Human Factors Analysis."
Simply by applying mostly known methods and common sense, the rocket-engine designer can do much to prevent human error by the design of his parts and by mandatory actions during their build ing, checking, and handling. The following are only typical examples of a probably infinite number  of ways to prevent human error by design:

 Clear marking of bolts, lines, connectors, wires.
 Use of dissimilar connectors ,  dissimilar threads, a variety of keyways, etc. to make incorrect electrical and mechanical connections impossible.

 Safety wiring, electrical and mechanical inter locks.

 Painting bright red and/or  attaching bright red streamers to auxiliary devices that must be re moved before operation.

 Storing of components and systems that have successfully passed all inspections and checkouts in locked, controlled-storage rooms.

 Simulated, mock opera t ions~with  intentional attempts at improper handling, assembly, checkout, and operation of components and sys tems~to  assist
"foolproofing" during development.

None of these and numerous similar steps will eliminate human errors. However, they will substan tially reduce the likelihood of them and thus con tribute to overall reliability.

Design Reviews for Reliability

The reliability of a rocket engine and its components depends on many factors. A concurrent engineering approach topped with periodic design reviews can bulwark reliability. In practice, a design review, the progressive evaluation of a design, starts with the pre liminary schematics, layouts, and specifications and extends through the release of all final drawings. Those conducting reliability design reviews should include reliability specialists, design engineers, de


398 DESIGN OF LIQUID-PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES velopment, test, and service engineers, and various specialists for structures, materials, manufacturing, and quality control. A minimum of three design re views should be made for each design:

1) Preliminary design review. This is a prelim inary review of work statements, basic concepts, schematics, layouts, and analyses. It determines de velopment needs and results in decisions for the next design phases. This review should uncover misappli cations, critical areas and marginal designs at an early stage, when changes can be effected without dif ficulty.

2) Critical design review. This is the most im portant review for decisions and approvals. It in cludes formal review of all reliability aspects of lay outs, analyses, planned development tests, and pro curement specifications.

3) Final design review. This is the final review of overall design layouts, detail and assembly draw ings, analyses, process specifications, and R&D test results, before production release.

The reviews should emphasize the following points: structural integrity, function and performance, customer (vehicle) connections and envelope, mate rials compatibility and component  interfaces, pro ducibility and cost, reliability and repeatability, mal function effects, environment  and servicing, and
"special" requirements. It is highly recommended that the agreed-to layout bear the approval signatures of the groups involved.

A reliability checklist tailored to the individual designs may be used as a guide during the various design-review phases. The "Design Check-Off Sheet"
shown in section 2.5 may serve this purpose.

Design reviews are valuable and cost-saving tools for improving reliability. A group well organized and staffed will assure a meaningful review and instigate effective recommendations and actions. Complete documentation of all review details will provide valu able data for future reference.

Failures occur, from time to time, that cannot readily be isolated as having originated in a given component  or par t - -because  several causes were present simultaneously and could not tge separated, because instrumentation was inadequate, recording only the ultimate effects but not the cause, or because an incomplete investigation was conducted, perhaps in the hope it would not happen again.

Classification of a failure as "unexplained" should never be done as a matter of convenience, but rather only as a last resort if the most thorough investiga tion did not establish a clear cause. Complete and accurate records must be kept of the details associ ated with the failure. Through special statistical methods it may be possible to isolate the cause or causes at a later date. Also, special instrumentation may immediately be added in the areas of suspected but unproven causes. But the most sophisticated ex planation of a failure cannot transform it into a suc cess.

Under "Man-rating" the cost of a single launch was mentioned. Press releases give the cost of a ma jor space program as about 3.5 billion dollars a yea rml0  million a day! To save a mission, or just a single day of preparation, by improved reliability will quite clearly be worth the effort!

Likewise, the loss of a launch, or a day in the pro gram, is very costly indeed. The rocket-engine de signer must do everything he can to prevent either.



Appendix C

Rocket Engine Materials

Liquid propellant rocket engines utilize a wide range They are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking and of materials; from steel alloys to thermoplastics and hydrogen embrittlement and become quite brittle at composites. This appendix presents a brief dis- cryogenic temperatures. With the exception of 440C, cussion of a range of material types and their general martensitic stainless steels have limited usefulness on application in the design of liquid propellant rocket liquid propellant rocket engines. Being a high-car engines, bon alloy, 440C attains the highest hardness of the stainless steels. It is widely used for bearings and Plain-Carbon/Low-Alloy Steels other compressively loaded hardware requiring wear resistance.

Plain-carbon steels alloy iron and carbon. The low carbon grades (0.1-0.2%) have excellent ductility and toughness and are easily formed. The medium-car bon grades (0.3-0.5%) respond well to heat treatment, and thus provide a good combination of strength and toughness. The high-carbon grades (1.0-1.2%)
are hard and wear-resistant, but have poor toughness and ductility.

Low-alloy steels contain up to 2.0% alloying ele ment in addition to the iron and carbon. Adding al loying elements to steel increases hardenability (i.e., ability to harden through thick sections). Other im provements derived from alloy addition include im proved elevated-temperature properties, tough-hess, and corrosion resistance.

Plain-carbon and low-alloy steels are n o t  good candidates for rocket-engine hardware. Although in expensive, readily available, easy to fabricate, and typically high in strength, steels poorly resist atmo spheric corrosion and will rust in ambient environ ments unless protected. Also, they have a limited range of useful operating temperatures. Most steels become brittle below 0F and, on the high-tempera ture side, are limited by tempering temperature, which is usually below 1000F. Plain-carbon and al loy steels are susceptible to hydrogen-environment embrittlement, and are not resistant to stress-corro sion cracking in some heat-treat conditions.

Stainless Steels

In stainless steels--iron-carbon alloys with the addi Austen i t i c  s t a i n l e s s  s t ee l s  (300 series). The austenitic stainless steels all contain nickel in addi tion to the chromium. Nickel stabilizes austenite, normally a high-temperature phase, at room temper ature and below. Austenite differs from martensite in many respects. The nonmagnetic austenitic stainless steels are not heat-treatable, and cannot achieve the high strength of martensitic alloys. However, they possess good cryogenic toughness, good fabricability and weldability, excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to stress-corrosion cracking, and are com patible with oxygen and hydrogen. Relatively low cost, high availability, and good fabricability make austenitic stainless steels an excellent choice for rocket-engine components where strength-to-weight ratio is not a primary consideration.

Most austenitic stainless steels will be limited in usefulness by their low (30-ksi) room-temperature yield strength. Alloy 21-6-9, a nitrogen-strengthened modification, has about twice the yield strength at room temperature and three times the yield strength at -400F of 300-series stainless steel. It does not re quire heat treatment and possesses all of the other at tributes of austenitic stainless steels.

The corrosion resistance of all stainless steels can be severely diminished by denying access to a plentiful supply of oxygen. For this reason, any ap plication which results in close laying surfaces or crevices should be avoided. Multiply assemblies, such as bellows, are therefore not ideal applications for stainless steels.

Moreover, a carbide precipitation characterizes many austenitic stainless steels when heated in the

,1 ,1 tion of at least 12% chromium--the chromium pro- temperature range of 800-1600F. This sensitization vides a "passive" oxide film that protects the body reduces corrosion resistance. Not only is this a limi from most corrosive environments. This film must tation of application temperature, but also of pro be maintained to ensure corrosion protection, cesses which involve heating above 800F. The prob Oxygen shielding could cause deterioration of this lems of sensitization can be mitigated by utilizing passive film, rendering the steel "active"--having low-arbon grades (304L, 316L) or stabilized grades corrosion resistance and galvanic activity similar to (321,347) of austenitic stainless steels. those of low-alloy steels.

However, most of the PH stainless steels are martensitic, and as such are susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking, hydrogen environment embrittlement, and loss of toughness at cryogenic temperatures.  An exception, A286, austenitic steel, possesses all of the attributes of the austenitic stainless steels coupled with high strength
(up to 200-ksi ultimate tensile strength in the cold worked condition). A286 has proven to be excep tionally suitable for fasteners, and has been used for nozzle tubing. Poor weldability limits wider applica tion of A286. JBK 75, a modification of A286, is not susceptible to weld cracking and therefore has appli cability for rocket-engine hardware.

Iron-Base SuperaIIoys

The iron-base low-expansion superalloys have exten sive application in liquid-propellant rocket engines because they provide high strength, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and resistance to hydrogen-envi ronment embrittlement (HEE). These iron-nickel cobalt alloys retain excellent properties from-423 to
1200F, are resistant to stress-corrosion cracking, and are readily weldable. However, lack of resistance to corrosion limits the use of them.

Incoloy 903 was the first of these alloys to find widespread application to structural components op erating in gaseous hydrogen or hydrogen-rich steam. It also can be used as an overlay to provide HEE pro tection to welds of non-HEE-resistant alloys. Incoloy
903 can be thermomechanically processed (TMP) for improved high-temperature stress-rupture properties.

Incoloy 907 offers~ better stress-rupture properties without requiring the TMP procedure. Incoloy 909
offers better low-cycle fatigue life and a simplified heat-treat cycle, which is compatible with that for Inconel 718. The weldability of Incoloy 907 has been rated higher than that of Incoloy 903, and Incoloy
909 has been shown to be the most weldable of the group.

Aluminum Alloys

Aluminum alloys are low in cost, easily fabricated, and readily available, but are limited in rocket-engine usage by maximum operating temperature. The high strength wrought alloys (i.e., 2024, 7075) are limited to
200-300F while the cast alloys such as Tens-50 and
356 can be used in the 300-400F range. The devel opment of aluminum-base-metal matrix composites has extended the operational limits of wrought alu minum alloys to the 800-900F range. However, lim ited availability, high cost, and difficulties in fabrica tion have been deterrents to the use of these com posites in rocket engines. All of the aluminum alloys are light in weight, resistant to hydrogen embrittle ment, and (most) have excellent cryogenic proper ties. Caution should be exercised with aluminum ap plications in oxygen systems because of low ignition temperature.

The casting alloys, low-strength wrought alloys, and moderate-strength 6061 are weldable. Corrosion resistance varies from excellent to fair; but in general the higher-strength alloys must be anodized for at mospheric-  and galvanic-corrosion protection. Anodizing forms an electrically insulating layer that could preclude electrical grounding.

Copper Alloys

Copper of course has high electrical and thermal conductivity, excellent corrosion resistance, and ease of fabrication, plus immunity to hydrogen-environ ment embrittlement. Alloying elements improve its strength, but generally at the expense of electrical and thermal conductivity. For example, 2% beryl lium can increase ultimate tensile strength of copper from 30 to 200 ksi; but the electrical conductivity of beryllium copper is only 20% of pure copper.

The more widely used copper alloys--brass
(copper and zinc), phosphor bronze (copper and tin), and beryllium copper (copper and beryl l ium) have strength increasing in the order listed.

The major application of copper alloys in rocket engines is for high-heat-flux applications, such as combustion chambers. Their high thermal conduc tivities minimize thermal gradients and resulting thermal stresses. Narloy A is a copper-silver alloy with thermal conductivity equivalent to pure copper, but with moderately high strength to 800F. Narloy-Z, with a zirconium addition, improves ductility and fa tigue life, and extends the operating range to 1000F. These alloys are available in the cast as well as wrought form. Copper alloys also serve as electrical conductors, conductive springs, and bearings and bushings.

Nickel-Base Alloys

Nickel-base alloys comprise some 65% of the weight of the Space Shuttle Main Engine. These alloys de rive their widespread usage in rocket engines from superior corrosion resistance, high-temperature oxi dation resistance, retention of useful properties over a wide temperature range, and, in many cases, very unique physical properties. The nickel-base alloys can be divided into three groups, based on applica tion.

The first group---nickel-base alloys used mainly for superior corrosion resistance--include Nickel 200, the monel alloys, Inconel 600, Inconel 625, and elec tro-deposited (ED) nickel. Inherently corrosion-re sistant, nickel does not depend upon a metastable passive film for protection; and, being strongly elec tronegative, it is not susceptible to galvanic corrosion when in contact with most other metals. Monels, al loys of nickel and copper, besides having good cor rosion resistance, have useful magnetic properties at cryogenic temperature and high resistance to igni tion in oxygen. The Inconel alloys, composed of nickel-chromium-iron, resist oxidation at tempera tures up to 1800F.

The second group, the nickel-base superalloys, re tain high strength at elevated temperatures. Alloy
718, the workhorse of this group, has high strength up to 1300F, good cryogenic ductility, and good weld ability. Fine-grained material should be specified for



APPENDIX C 401

parts to be electron-beam-welded. Higher-tempera ture applications exploit Rene' 41, Waspaloy, and MAR-M-246.

The third group, the special-application alloys, includes Nichrome (for electrical-resistance heating elements), chromel and alumel (for thermocouples), and Incoloys and Invar (for low-thermal-expansion applications).

All of the nickel-base alloys resist corrosion and stress corrosion and are oxygen-compatible, but are susceptible to hydrogen-environment embrittlement
(HEE) at temperatures above -200F. HEE in nickel base alloys can be prevented by avoiding plastic strains or, this being impractical, by providing a pro tective barrier, such as electroplating with copper or gold or overlaying by weld deposition with a nonsus ceptible alloy.

Cobalt Alloys

Cobalt-base alloys, like nickel alloys, offer excellent high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Unlike the nickel alloys, cobalt alloys are immune to HEE.

Alloy 188, a corrosion- and heat-resistant alloy, exhibits outstanding oxidation and creep resistance up to 2100F. Although not hardenable by heat treatment, 188 has moderate room-temperature strength and good cryogenic properties. It also has good resistance to corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking and can be readily welded, including by electron-beam welding.

Elgiloy, a cobalt-base alloy, has found widespread usage for springs. The alloy has high strength and good corrosion resistance, and is nonmagnetic. Elgiloy derives its strength from a combination of heat treatment and cold work. It has a maximum use temperature of approximately 700F.

Titanium Alloys

Titanium alloys possess high strength-to-weight ratios and good toughness, as well as excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. However, titanium alloys are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement at temperatures above -ll0F, and are not compatible with gaseous or liquid oxygen or with red fuming nitric acid, at any temperature. Titanium alloys also are incompatible with the products of combustion from many propellants; these factors limit their usefulness in liquid-propellant rocket en gine systems. They can be applied, however, in fuel systems involving propellants such as liquid hydro gen, monomethyl hydrazine (MMH), and kerosene
(RP-1). They also are compatible, under certain cir cumstances, with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO). Titanium alloys have found use in liquid-propellant rocket en gine systems for pump impellers and inducers, valve bodies, pump housings, high-pressure fuel ducts, hy draulic tubing, pressure bottles, struts, gimbal blocks, propellant-storage bottles, and nozzles.

The most demanding applications have been for use at cryogenic temperatures, where titanium alloys offer some of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of presently available engineering materials. Two tita nium alloys are most commonly used at cryogenic temperatures: Ti-5AI-2.5Sn ELI and Ti-6A1-4V ELI. In the ELI (extra-low interstitial) grade of these alloys, good cryogenic toughness is achieved by controlling the interstitial elements oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen, and the substitutional element iron, to much lower than normal levels. Typically, Ti-6AI-4V ELI is used to -320F while the higher-toughness Ti 5AI-2.5Sn ELI is used as low as -423F. However, Ti 6AI-4V ELI can be employed at -423F if the compo nent design compensates for its lower ductility and toughness.

Titanium and titanium alloys are classified into three major categories according to the predominant phases present in their microstructure: alpha, alpha beta, and beta alloys. Although non-heat-treatable, alpha alloys offer high toughness, are more oxida tion-resistant than alpha-beta or beta alloys, are us able up to about 1000F, and are relatively difficult to form. Ti-5AI-2.5Sn is an example of an alpha alloy. Alpha-beta alloys, such as Ti-6AI-4V, are heat-treat able to higher-strength levels, are usable to 800F and in some instances to 1000F, and are somewhat more formable than alpha alloys. However, alpha-beta al loys ordinarily would not be used in the fully-heat treated condition because its heat-treat response is limited to relatively thin sections (--1.0 in.) and its fracture toughness decreases significantly with in creasing strength level. Beta alloys are generally quite formable at room temperature, are usable up to approximately 600"F, and are heat-treatable to rela tively high strength (e.g., -190 ksi) in thick sections while still retaining good toughness. The disadvan tages of beta alloys are a higher density, lower oxida tion resistance and lower toughness at cryogenic temperatures. Examples of beta alloys include Ti 10V-2Fe-3AI, Ti-3AI-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr, and Ti-15V-3AI 3Cr-3Sn.

Most titanium alloys can be welded, although welding requires the hardware to be thoroughly clean and the operation to be performed in a high-purity inert gas (Ar, He) or vacuum. Titanium and titanium alloys are available as sheet, strip, plate, bar, forgings, extrusions, tubing, and castings.

Thermoplastic Materials

Thermoplastics, polymeric materials that can be formed or reformed by melting or softening with heat, serve well as electrical insulation and seals. They include fluorocarbons, nylon, polycarbonate, and amide-imide materials. Of these, the fluorocar bon polymers find the greatest number of applica tions in liquid-propellant rocket engine design. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene
(Kef-F) with or without fillers or reinforcing fibers find extensive use in rocket engines for seals and coatings for seals due to the compatibility of these materials with oxygen and their properties in both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

rubber materials noted in Fig. C-1 that find extensive use in O-ring seals, gasket-type seals, electrical insula tion, vibration dampers, etc. These materials are also used for adhesives, sealants, formed-in-place seals, and potting of electrical components.

Nitrile rubbers find considerable use because re sistant to oxidation and hydraulic fluids. They do not take a permanent set for long periods of time. Consequently, these rubbers find much use in O-ring seals of hydraulic and pneumatic components.

Silicone rubber, an extensively used sealant and potting compound, has been exploited primarily due to its ease of application and wide usable-tempera ture range of-165-500F. Fluorocarbon rubber is used when  the application requires compatibility with oxygen or when the use temperature is in the range of 300-375F.

Special designs may call for other elastomers, with unique properties. For example, resin-cured butyl has been found to provide excellent seals in NTO and/or hydrazine for short periods (i.e., under one hour).

C a r b o n s  and  Ceramics

Pressed-carbon materials and various ceramics find use in throat inserts for ablative engines, dynamic seals of gas-turbine drives of turbopumps, and coat ings to protect metals from high-temperature gases.

C o m p o s i t e s

A composite has a matrix materal reinforced in ran dom or oriented form with a special fiber, tape, fab ric, etc. Examples would be glass-fiber-filled polyte trafluoroethylene (PTFE), tape-wrapped ablative plas tics, fabric-reinforced epoxy sheets, filament-wound thrust-chamber shells, etc. Composites find a wide range of uses in liquid-propellant rocket engine de sign, such as in seals, thrust-chamber structure, elec trical printed wiring-boards, and ball-bearing separa tors. The matrix may be carbon, metallic, polymeric, or ceramic. Three types of composites might be dis tringuished: structural plastics, ablatives, and carbon carbon composites.

Structural  p las t ics .  Choice of thermosetting resin such as an epoxy, phenolic, or polyimide for fabricating a laminate will depend upon the thermal and adhesive properties required. Epoxy resins offer high adhesive strength, but are more severely limited in maximum use-temperatures. Other resins such as the phenolics or polyimides have very good high temperature characteristics, but at the expense of lowered adhesion and greater fabrication difficulties.



APPENDIX C 403

Reinforcements used in t h e  laminated structure may take the form of layers of fabric, random place ment  of short fibers, or very precise placement of continuous filaments through the use of filament winding or lay-up of collimated tapes. The exact type and form of reinforcement will depend upon the mechanical properties that are to be derived from it. For example,  a cover requiring low mechanical strength and rigidity might be made of random fibers of glass sprayed onto a form with the resin added simultaneously, while a structural shell for a small thrust chamber might well be produced by fil ament-winding a resin-preimpregnated graphite so as to produce a structure with high strength and rigidity.

Ablat ives .  Rocket ablat ives~materials  that can
"sacrificially" cool a thrust chamber or nozz le~usu ally are fabric-reinforced phenolic or rubber-modi fied-phenolic laminated materials. The reinforcing fabric is placed in the formed structure at some pre determined angle to the expected flow of the hot gas. The matrix material and the reinforcing material are each selected for performance with the propellants to be used and the duty cycle of the thrust chamber or nozzle.

The phenolic or rubber-modified-phenolic resins have found the greatest use. They offer a high-tem perature-resistant matrix with predictable properties when exposed to the hot gas of the rocket engine. They form a structural char and provide a cooling gas at the hot surface as they pyrolize. The use of rubber modification yields a somewhat  lower abla tion rate, but keeps the structure from delaminating.

Reinforcements for ablative componen ts  will usually be selected on the basis of the oxidizer. Oxygen-based oxidizers demand the use of a fiber re inforcement that will not oxidize and that has a high melting point plus high viscosity when melted, such as silica glass and quartz, which tend to protect the char from oxidizing rapidly even though there is a high percentage of water vapor in the combustion gases of the thrust chamber. A fluorine-based oxi dizer develops the combustion products that rapidly attack quartz and other glass, forming fibrous materi als. This propellant demands reinforcements of car bon or graphite.

Carbon-carbon compos i tes .  Carbon-carbon compos i t e s~mate r i a l s  with some type of amor phous-carbon matrix reinforced by fibrous carbon or g raph i t e~ f ind  use as thermal shields and nozzle extensions. In all of the uses associated with liquid propellant rocket engine design, these composites have been coated with some form of silicon carbide
(with or without glass formers) to prevent oxidation.

Adhesives

Polymeric and ceramic materials are also used in adhesive applications on rocket engines. In general, silicones are used for sealants and bonding applica tions requiring good peel-strength at temperatures in the range o f - 1 6 5  - 500F; epoxies for high bond shear-strength from -65F to as high as 350F; epoxy phenolics for good bond shear-strength from liquid helium temperature  to 500F; and polyurethanes when bonding must be done with contact pressure without elevated-temperature cure and the material must exhibit good peel and shear strength at a cryo genic temperature. Pressure-sensitive-adhesives hav ing a natural rubber base find use on tapes where the adhesive must be completely removed with the tape.

Lubricants Although some hydrocarbon lubricants used for rocket engines typify those for automotive purposes
(i.e., gear cases), most will have to be selected on the basis of propellant compatibility. As a result, few greases or oils are used. If needed, a grease will usu ally be based on a fluorocarbon oil. Because most oils and greases become brittle at cryogenic temper atures, dry-film lubrication is most often used, the lu bricant usually being pure molybdenum disulfide powder  sprayed onto the component surfaces with some binding agent (usually a resin if a fuel envi ronment or a phosphate material if oxidizer).

Platings, Surface Finishes, Coatings

Components are sometimes given a surface finish to assure corrosion resistance. It can be applied either by electroplating or by an electrolysis process, a chemical film, or a paint. Coatings are also used to give a soft chemical-resistant sealing surface to pres sure-assisted seals.

Chromium and nickel are examples of plating materials commonly used. An anodized surface is an example of a chemical-conversion coating. Zinc or strontium chromate-containing paints are commonly used to protect a variety of metals against corrosion.

Many alloys protect against corrosion with an ox ide film. To assure the formation of this film, the component will often be given a chemical treatment
("passivated") to assure formation of the protective oxide.
