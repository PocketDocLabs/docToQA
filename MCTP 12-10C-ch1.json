        "## Chapter 1 The Jungle Environment\nThis chapter examines jungle regions found throughout the world and their environmental impact on personnel and equipment.\nJungles are harsh environments, characterized by intense heat, heavy precipitation, and thick vegetation that can adversely impact operations for unprepared forces.\nRestrictive terrain can limit mobility and observation while excessive heat and humidity can fatigue troops and degrade equipment. However, through preparation, acclimatization, and preventive measures, Soldiers/Marines can overcome these challenges and prevail in the dense forests, swamps, and grasslands of the world's jungles.",
        "## Jungle Regions\n1-1. Jungles are masses of tropical vegetation that are often tangled, overgrown, and impenetrable. Successful jungle operations require modifications to equipment and tactics as the environment can profoundly affect military operations. Primary, secondary, and savanna are the three main classifications of jungles. Primary and secondary jungles can be further classified as tropical or deciduous based upon the predominate trees. Common land features in the jungle are swamps, savannas, and cultivated areas. The large amounts of annual precipitation support incredible plant and wildlife density and diversity as well as make jungles the most ecologically rich and vibrant environments on the planet. They occur most commonly in the tropical areas of the world, mainly Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. (See figure 1-1 for locations of the major jungles.)\n1-2. Jungle climates vary with location. Close to the equator, all seasons are nearly alike, with rains throughout the year; farther from the equator, especially in India and Southwest Asia, jungles have distinct wet (monsoon) and dry seasons. Both zones have high temperatures (averaging 78 to 95+ degrees Fahrenheit [26 to 35 degrees Celsius]), heavy rainfall (as much as 394 inches [1,000 centimeters] annually), and high humidity (90 percent) throughout the year.",
        "## Jungle Types\n1-3. Jungles generally consist of dense forests, grasslands, cultivated areas, and swamps; however, the degree to which these features are present is used to classify the jungle by type. Jungles are classified as either primary jungles, secondary jungles, or savanna based on the terrain and vegetation.",
        "## Primary Jungles\n1-4. Depending on the type of trees growing in the forests, primary jungles are classified either as tropical rain forests or as deciduous forests. Unlike secondary jungles or savannas, primary jungles consist largely of old growth trees undisturbed by logging, farming, or other human activities. Primary jungles have tall trees that form a dense canopy. As such, little light penetrates to the jungle floor and undergrowth may be relatively thin. Secondary jungles exist in areas that have been previously cleared for farming or logging and are characterized by younger, shorter trees and thicker undergrowth. Savannas are natural grasslands and the few trees present are often grouped together in small groves or thickets. Figure 1-2 illustrates a primary jungle.",
        "## Tropical Rain Forests\n1-5. Tropical rain forests consist mostly of large trees whose branches spread and lock together to form canopies. These canopies, which can exist at two or three different levels, may form as low as 32 feet (10 meters) from the ground. The canopies prevent sunlight from reaching the ground, causing a lack of undergrowth on the jungle floor. Extensive above-ground root systems and hanging vines are common. These conditions, combined with a wet and soggy surface, make vehicular traffic difficult. Foot movement is easier in tropical rain forests than in other types of jungle. Except where felled trees create a gap in the canopy of the rain forest, observation from the air is nearly impossible. Ground observation is generally limited to 164 feet (50 meters) or less.",
        "## Deciduous Forests\n1-6. Deciduous forests are found in subtropical zones where both wet and dry seasons exist. These jungles generally grow between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. In the wet season, trees are fully leaved; in the dry season, some of the foliage dies. Trees generally grow less densely in deciduous forests than in rain forests. This thinner canopy allows more rain and sunlight to filter to the ground, producing thick undergrowth. The thick undergrowth of deciduous jungles has a tendency to canalize foot movement due to the deliberate efforts required to break new trail. In the wet season with the trees in full leaf, observation both from the air and on the ground is severely limited; the full leaves impact human observation, optics, and detection from aviation assets.",
        "## Secondary Jungles\n1-7. Secondary jungles grow predominantly at the edge of tropical rain forests and deciduous forests and in areas where jungles have been cleared and abandoned. Secondary jungles appear when the ground has been repeatedly exposed to sunlight. These areas typically display heavy overgrowth with weeds, grasses, thorns, ferns, canes, and shrubs. Foot movement is extremely slow and difficult. Vegetation may reach to a height of 6 feet (2 meters) which severely limits observation. See figure 1-3 for an example of a secondary jungle.",
        "## Savanna\n1-8.  Savannas are generally located away from the equator but within the tropics. Savannas consist of broad, open grasslands with few trees. The thick grass has broad-blades and grows 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 meters) high.\nMovement in the savanna is generally easier than in other types of jungle areas, especially for vehicles. However, the sharp-edged, dense grass and extreme heat make foot movement a slow and tiring process.\nGround visibility varies depending on the height of the savanna grass.\nConcealment from air observation is poor for both troops and vehicles. See figure 1-4 for an example of a savanna.",
        "## Jungle Features\n1-9.  Common jungle features include swamps, rivers, bamboo forests, and cultivated areas.",
        "## Swamps\n1-10. Swamps are forested wetlands. Common to all low jungle areas, swamps have lots of water and poor drainage. Swamps will affect logistical considerations in littoral operations. There are two basic types of swamps-mangrove and palm.",
        "## Mangrove Swamps\n1-11. Mangrove swamps grow along coastal areas wherever tides influence water flow. The mangrove is a shrub-like tree, which grows 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 meters) high. These trees have tangled root systems, both above and below the water level, which restrict movement to foot or small boats. Observation in mangrove swamps-both on the ground and from the air-is poor. Concealment is excellent.",
        "## Palm Swamps\n1-12. Palm swamps exist in both salt and freshwater areas. Like movement in the mangrove swamps, movement through palm swamps is mostly restricted to foot\n(sometimes small boats).\nVehicular traffic is nearly impossible except after extensive road construction by engineers.\nObservation and fields of fire are very limited. Concealment from both air and ground observation is excellent.",
        "## Bamboo\n1-13. Bamboo grows in clumps of varying heights in jungles throughout the tropics. Large stands of bamboo are excellent obstacles for wheeled or tracked vehicles. Troop movement on foot through bamboo is slow, exhausting, and noisy. Troops should bypass bamboo stands if possible.",
        "## Cultivated Areas\n1-14. Cultivated areas exist throughout the tropics and range from large, well-planned, and wellmanaged farms and plantations to small tracts cultivated by individual farmers. Rice paddies, plantations, and small farms make up the three general types of cultivated areas.",
        "## Rice Paddies\n1-15. Rice paddies are flat, flooded fields with muddy and soft bottoms. Farmers control the flooding of the fields with a network of dikes and irrigation ditches and fluctuate flooding with seasonal and agricultural cycles. The variable depth of flood waters directly impacts movement with higher flood waters making movement very restricted. However, travel by vehicle is difficult even when fields are dry. Concealment is poor in rice paddies. Cover is limited to the dikes, and then only from ground fire. Observation and fields of fire are excellent. Foot movement is poor when the fields are wet because troops must wade through water and soft mud that is often 20 inches (1/2 meter) deep. When the fields are dry, foot movement becomes easier. Dikes, about 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) tall, are the only obstacles.",
        "## Plantations\n1-16. Plantations are large farms or estates where tree crops, such as rubber and coconut, are grown. They are usually carefully planned and free of undergrowth (like a well-tended park). Movement through plantations is generally easy. Observation along the rows of trees is generally good. Cover and concealment can be found behind the trees, but troops moving down the cultivated rows are exposed.",
        "## Small Farms\n1-17. Small farms exist throughout the tropics. Farmers often create small farms when they clear secondary jungle to cultivate crops. Movement through these areas may be difficult due to fallen trees and scrub brush. Generally, observation and fields of fire have fewer restrictions in cultivated areas than in uncultivated jungles. However, the cultivation removes much of the natural cover and concealment leaving troops more exposed in these areas.",
        "## Weather\n1-18. Leaders and troops must understand that the jungle environment is neutral; it affects both friendly and enemy troops the same. Leaders and troops should reference ATP 2-01.3 and MCRP 2-10B.1 (MCRP 2-3A) when preparing estimates on the effects of terrain and weather on operations. 1-19. The degree to which troops are trained to live and fight in harsh environments will determine their unit's success or failure. High heat and humidity are key characteristics of most jungles. Humidity compounds the effects of high heat by making it more difficult for Soldiers/Marines to regulate body temperature through sweat evaporation. 1-20. Despite the obvious impact of heat and humidity, Soldiers/Marines must recognize that they will likely be exposed to cold as well. Temperatures in the jungle may drop 10 degrees or more at night. When coupled with high humidity and often rainy conditions, Soldiers/Marines may become quite uncomfortable if not properly prepared.\nTemperatures below freezing do not occur, but chilly nights are common. In some jungles during the winter months, the nights are cold enough to require a wool blanket or poncho liner for sleeping. At a minimum, Soldiers/Marines should replace wet clothing worn during the day with dry clothing at night. 1-21. Rainfall in many parts of the tropics is much greater than that in most temperate zones. Tropical downpours are usually followed by clear skies, and, in most places, the rains are predictable at certain times of the day. However, there are areas and times of the year where there is nearly continuous rainfall in many areas of the tropics.",
        "## Terrain\n1-22. Jungle terrain is varied and ranges from nearly flat savanna to impassable mountain ranges. Units preparing to deploy to specific jungle regions should seek detailed information on terrain prevalent in the expected area of operations due to the terrain variations. 1-23. Jungle terrain can canalize operations due to poor cross-country mobility, limited hardened roads and trails, and limited bridges and hardened crossing points. Some areas affect cross-country mobility with poor trafficability due to soft soils, rocky areas, mountains, dense to impenetrable vegetation, marshy areas, streams, and major rivers. Roads are usually scarce, poorly maintained, and primitive. Limited infrastructure reduces hardened crossing points over or through water features.",
        "## Observation And Fields Of Fire\n1-24. Observation and fields of fire are generally restricted in jungles. Steep jungle terrain, extensive and dense vegetation, and intermittent and rapidly changing atmospheric conditions restrict direct-fire weapons well short of their maximum range. The minimum engagement range of weapon systems must be considered when emplacing and employing weapons, especially for wire-guided munitions and delayed fused weapons. 1-25. Even though the landscape appears flat when viewed from above; the terrain under the dense vegetative growth can be undulating with relatively deep streams, river beds, and depressions creating significant dead space. Direct fire weapons must be sited to provide mutual support and cover dead space. Troops cover dead space by utilizing indirect fires paired with sensors or observation posts, or aerial fire assets. 1-26.\nWhen units cannot establish manned observation posts from dominant terrain, the only means of observation may be from manned aircraft systems, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), or electronic sensor. However, dense vegetation and weather conditions can severely limit these platforms and systems. 1-27. UASs should be used in conjunction with other unmanned and manned reconnaissance and surveillance systems in a jungle environment. Successful UAS employment in a jungle requires adequate planning for dense vegetation and other environmental factors. Depending on the platform and mission, planners and operators may have to consider the environmental factors in four separate locations: landing and recovery site, transit route, satellite relay site, and anticipated target location. (See ATP 3-04.64/ MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/ NTTP 3-55.14/AFTTP 3-2.64 and MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3-42.1] for details on planning for UASs. For UAS characteristics and employment considerations, refer to ATP 3-04.1, ATP 3-04.64/MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/ NTTP 3-55.14/AFTTP 3-2.64, and MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3- 42.1], and all applicable technical manuals.) 1-28. Troops can conduct or enhance observation using electronic devices that utilize discrete bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronically assisted observation includes radar, image intensifiers, and infrared (IR) systems that may be ground based or aerial. 1-29. Radars emit extremely short bursts of electromagnetic radiation, which are then reflected off a target and return as an echo. Several radar modes work in the jungle, including moving target indicator and synthetic aperture radar. Radar cannot positively identify a target, cannot see through buildings or terrain, and is degraded by rain and vegetation. Additionally, radar is an active electromagnetic emitter that can be sensed by threat systems. (See ATP 3-55.6/MCRP 2-10A.4 [MCRP 2-24A]/NTTP 3-55.13/AFTTP 3-2.2 for additional information regarding aerial radar operations.) 1-30. Image intensifiers, such as night vision devices (NVDs), work by amplifying visible light and the IR spectrum closest to the frequencies of visible light to create a digital picture. NVDs are passive unless paired with an illuminator for active use. Passive NVDs can operate effectively in jungle environments when ambient visible light exists. However, cloud cover, fog, inclement weather, and dense overhead vegetation negatively impact passive NVDs. (See TC 3-22.9 for more on using NVDs.) 1-31. IR imaging sensors work by amplifying the mid- and far-wavelengths of the IR band to create a digital picture representing the total IR radiation of an object and its background. IR sensors are generally passive devices. IR sensors work effectively in jungle environments in all lighting. The performance characteristics of an IR sensor determines its capabilities to see through different densities and types of atmospheric obscurants. (See ATP 3-04.64/\nMCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/NTTP 3-55.14/ AFTTP 3-2.64, MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3-42.1], and TC 3-22.9 for more information on IR sensors.) IR imaging sensors are effective during all environmental conditions. 1-32. Sensor systems operate in one of two modes:\nActive. Active sensors emit energy that reflects from targets and is recaptured by the emitting or other nearby sensor, indicating the presence of a target. Examples of active sensors are searchlights and radar.\nPassive. Passive sensors do not emit energy;\nthey collect energy, which may indicate the presence of a target. Examples of passive sensors are the human eye, NVDs, IR imaging devices, acoustic sensors, and photographic devices.\n1-33. Correction of indirect and aerial fires can be complicated in the jungle environment. Heavy tree cover can cause munitions to detonate in the overhanging branches. Troops can overcome this early detonation by using special fusing.\nAdditionally, troops may fail to observe the impact of rounds due to limited observation ranges requiring adjustment of fires to be conducted using other methods.",
        "## Avenues Of Approach\n1-34. Roads and trails crisscross many jungle areas, the majority of which are unimproved and not allweather capable. Improved all-weather roads that support wheeled vehicles are rare; complex road systems beyond simple commercial links generally do not exist. For centuries, locals have used simple roads and trails to connect centers of commerce, collection points, and natural resources such as mineral deposits and timber resources. Roads and trails in jungle regions support dismounted movement. Speed of movement varies depending on the weather, ground composition, wet gap crossings, and topographical influences. 1-35. The relatively few improved all-weather routes in many jungle areas will channelize movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles. Logistics units are heavily impacted by this scarcity and channelizing as they require improved routes in order to maintain the line of communications (LOC) for their large, mission- essential vehicles that have limited off-road trafficability. 1-36. Jungle regions use rivers and streams as highways to move large amounts of material any significant distance. These rivers and streams often have heavy overgrowth providing concealment from ground and aerial observation. The threat of fluctuating water levels due to precipitation, or the lack thereof, poses significant danger to Soldiers/ Marines and their equipment as they traverse rivers and streams. Flooding may occur even when it is not raining in the immediate area. Before crossing rivers or streams, units reconnoiter the far side of the linear obstacle for both trafficability and security. Enemy forces in covered and concealed positions can easily engage exposed Soldiers and Marines during gap crossings. 1-37. Normally mangrove and palm swamps prove impassable to all but the lightest equipped forces. Regardless, any force requires detailed reconnaissance to assess trafficability. Many jungles have swamp areas associated with rivers and streams as well as along the sea coast. Old trails or paths may cross the swamp, which are visible from the ground but invisible from aerial observation.\nTrafficability of swamps directly relates to the depth of the water, which can vary widely based upon precipitation and the time of the year.\n1-38. Exploration for and production of oil and other natural resources means wells, pipelines, refineries, quarries, and crushing plants may be of strategic importance in the jungle. Pipelines installed 3 feet (1 meter) off the ground inhibit movement. Subsurface pipelines can also create an obstacle. In Southwest Asia, maps generally indicate locations of subsurface pipelines. Often, these pipes are buried at such a shallow depth that heavy vehicles can damage them when traversing them. Furthermore, if a pipeline ruptures, not only is the spill of oil a consideration, but the fumes may be hazardous as well. 1-39. Agriculture in jungle areas typically has large effects on trafficability. The dike systems associated with rice paddies can limit surface mobility and create choke points. Large plantations create areas with great amounts of trafficability for mounted and dismounted forces. Abandoned small farms can create small pockets of secondary jungle which significantly decreases trafficability.",
        "## Key Terrain\n1-40. *Key terrain* is an identifiable characteristic whose seizure or retention affords a marked advantage to either combatant (ADP 3-90). Key terrain in the jungle can be any man-made feature, water crossing, water way, or high ground. Because there are few man-made features in the jungle, those that do exist can become important, perhaps even key. Bridges over waterways, regardless of size, often become key terrain due to their relative scarcity. The high ground in the jungle can be key terrain, but limited observation and fields of fire may reduce their importance. 1-41. In jungle regions, navigable waterways are extremely likely to be key terrain. They often offer the only way to move large amounts of people, supplies, and equipment significant distances relatively rapidly. The meandering routes and variability of water flows complicates their utilization and security.",
        "## Obstacles\n1-42. Obstacles abound in jungle regions. Jungle are generally large natural obstacles to wheeled and tracked vehicles as well as dismounted troops. Waterways, thick to impenetrable vegetation, steep slopes, swamps, water saturated soils, and mountains all hinder cross-country movement. 1-43. The few trafficable areas in the jungle are ideal for employing man-made obstacles as the natural terrain denies readily available bypass routes. Buried mines of all types are incredibly effective in jungle regions due the ability of vegetation to hide any evidence of their emplacement.\n1-44. Rivers and streams can pose a danger to moving units, as they can appear unexpectedly, and vehicles and personnel can fall off the elevated embankment. The embankments of a river of stream may have heavy erosion and collapse under the weight of personnel or vehicles. River and stream embankments are particularly difficult to detect when conducting operations using NVDs, with limited ambient illumination, and thick vegetation.",
        "## Water\n1-45. Annual precipitation rates in the jungle are the highest in the world. Many of the major rivers of the world, or their tributaries, are part of the jungle regions. The Amazon River traverses the Amazon Rainforest and is the largest river in the world. The movement and presence of water in jungle is its defining characteristic and has a large impact on military operations.",
        "## Vegetation\n1-46. Jungle vegetation usually grows in dense concentrations and often provides concealment from the ground and air. Numerous edible plants and shrubs grow in the jungle that Soldiers/Marines can eat in survival situations. 1-47. Many jungle plants and shrubs have toxic resins that can cause blisters. Milky sap and red beans or berries are indicative of poisonous and dangerous plants. The danger from poisonous plants in the jungle is comparable to the woods of the United States eastern seaboard. Soldiers/Marines can avoid many of the dangers associated with poisonous vegetation by keeping their sleeves down and wearing gloves when practical. (Refer to ATP 3-50.21 for more information on poisonous and edible plants.)",
        "## Wildlife\n1-48. Jungles host an impressive array of biodiversity and contain many animal species that can harm troops. Paragraphs 1-49 through 1-62 broadly describe various animal species that pose a threat to Soldiers/Marines. (For more information on the various plants and animals encountered in the jungle, refer to ATP 3-50.21.)",
        "## Insects\n1-49. Numerous biting and stinging insects inhabit the jungle. Troops with known allergies to insect bites and stings must deploy with epinephrine autoinjectors. Medical providers should have higher than normal on-hand quantities of epinephrine due to the prevalence of biting and stinging insects in the jungle.\n1-50. Mosquitoes are the most dangerous of the tropical insects. The largest health threat posed by mosquitoes is malaria, but mosquitoes carry numerous other diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. Additionally, mosquitoes can carry heartworm larvae that can infect military working dogs. 1-51. Precautions against malaria and other mosquito borne diseases include-\nTaking prescribed antimalarial prophylactic medication.\nTaking prescribed heartworm prophylactic medication (military working dogs).\nUsing insect repellent. Wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing that covers as much of the body as possible.\nUsing nets or screens at every opportunity. Avoiding the worst infested areas when possible.\n1-52. Mosquitoes are most prevalent early at night and just before dawn. Troops must be especially cautious at these times. Malaria is more common in populated areas than in uninhabited jungle, so troops must also be especially cautious when operating around villages. 1-53. Flies can pose a health hazard to humans; they can carry and spread diseases if not controlled. Certain flies that feed on mammals and humans can cause lesions and infections. Troops can take the following precautions to protect against flies:\nUse insect repellent. Wear permethrin-impregnated clothing that covers as much of the body as possible.\nUse nets or screens at every opportunity. Avoid the worst infested areas when possible.\n1-54. Wasps and bees are common in some jungle regions, but they will rarely attack unless their nests are disturbed. When a nest is disturbed, troops must leave the area and reassemble at the last rally point. In case of stings, Soldiers/Marines seek medical attention. 1-55. Centipedes, spiders, and scorpions that inhabit the jungle can inflict painful stings. These insects prefer dark places. As such, Soldiers/Marines should shake out sleep systems and ensure clothing and boots are free of insects before dressing. Spider bites can be painful and often require medical treatment due to necrotic tissue and secondary infection. Ants can be dangerous to troops that are lying in the prone, sleeping, or injured and unable to move. Wounded troops should be placed in an area free of ants. 1-56. In Southeast Asian jungles, the rice borer moth of the lowlands collects around lights in great numbers during certain seasons. It is a small, plaincolored moth with a pair of tiny black spots on the wings. It should never be brushed off roughly, as the small barbed hairs of its body may be ground into the skin. This causes a sore, much like a burn, that often takes weeks to heal.",
        "## Leeches\n1-57. Leeches are common in many jungles, particularly throughout most of the Southwest Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Malay Peninsula. They are found in swampy areas, streams, and moist jungle country. They are not venomous, but their bites may become infected if not cared for properly. The small wound that they cause may provide a point of entry for infectious diseases that cause tropical ulcers or \"jungle sores.\" Troops operating in the jungle should watch for leeches on the body and brush them off before they have had time to bite. When they have taken hold, they should not be pulled off forcibly because part of the leech may remain in the skin. Leeches will release themselves if touched with insect repellent, a moist piece of tobacco, the burning end of a cigarette, a coal from a fire, or a few drops of alcohol. 1-58. Straps wrapped around the lower part of the legs (\"leech straps\") will prevent leeches from crawling up the legs and into the crotch area.\nSoldiers/Marines securely blouse or tuck their trousers into their boots to hinder leech access.",
        "## Snakes\n1-59. While traveling in jungle environments, troops must stay alert to and avoid disturbing snakes. Troops should be particularly watchful when clearing ground. Each jungle region has certain species indigenous to the area. Before deploying, Soldiers/Marines access the electronic DOD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) for the area accessible at <https:// www.fcg.pentagon.mil/>. Section VII, \"Travel Information,\" of the guide identifies diseases caused by local insects. Units need to establish a procedure for treating snakebites. Antivenin is used to treat venomous snakebites. Antivenin is specific to a snake species; there is not a universal snake antivenin. Depending on the availability of antivenin, and the ability to properly store it, snake bite victims may require urgent medical evacuation and treatment at the next higher echelon of medical care.\nNote. Treat all snakebites as venomous. For treatment of\nsnakebites, refer to TC 4-02.1.",
        "## Alligators, Crocodiles, And Caimans\n1-60. Alligators, crocodiles, and caimans are semiaquatic carnivorous reptiles that live in tropical areas. Crocodiles are extremely sensitive to cold while alligators can endure cold temperatures. Crocodiles inhabit fresh, brackish, and salt water environments; alligators and caimans are generally fresh water reptiles. Highly effective ambush predators, numerous documented cases of alligator, crocodile, and caiman attacks on people exist throughout the world. These territorial creatures will often attack to protect their nesting areas. Troops should exercise care when conducting operations in and around water inhabited by alligators, crocodiles, or caimans.",
        "## Other Jungle Animals\n1-61. In the jungles of Sumatra, Bali, Borneo, Southeast Asia, and Burma there are tigers, leopards, elephants, and Asian buffalo. Latin American jungles are inhabited by the jaguar, and Africa hosts lions, leopards, buffalo, and elephants. Ordinarily, these animals will not attack unless they are cornered or wounded. 1-62. Water buffalo and elephants are used throughout Asia for agricultural and timber work. They may appear tame, but they are not truly domesticated and should only be handled by experienced trainers and handlers. Troops should avoid these animals.",
        "## Environmental Effects On Personnel\n1-63. Properly prepared Soldiers/Marines should have no reason to fear the jungle. The jungle is neutral and affects combatants equally. The combatant whose personnel and equipment are best prepared for jungle operations has a distinct advantage. 1-64. The jungle is fatiguing, both physically and mentally. Discipline is essential and a single lapse may jeopardize the mission and endanger Soldiers/ Marines.\nChallenges associated with communications, situational awareness, and movement and maneuver/maneuver require that commanders exercise a high level of leadership and train their subordinates to assume greater responsibilities. Troops with good leadership are more apt to perform well under arduous conditions. Leaders must ensure all Soldiers/Marines clearly understand why they are fighting in such harsh conditions and keep their troops informed of the operational situation. 1-65. Welfare is an essential factor to maintaining morale in a harsh environment. Welfare covers more than simply providing mail and clean clothing. Leaders need to keep troops healthy and physically fit. They must provide troops adequate, palatable, regular food, and allow them periods of rest and sleep. These things will not always be possible, and discomfort is inevitable, but if Soldiers and Marines know that their leaders are doing everything they can to make life tolerable, they will more readily accept the extremes brought on by the environment. 1-66. Climatic stress on the human body in hot jungles can stem from any combination of air temperature, humidity, air movement, and radiant heat.\nOther factors-lack of acclimatization, dehydration, alcohol consumption, lack of sleep, and poor health-also adversely affect the body.",
        "## Heat Injuries\n1-67. Jungle characteristics include high heat and humidity. Soldiers/Marines operating in the jungle have a greater risk of heat injury than Soldiers/ Marines operating in more temperate environments. To maintain an optimum temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), the body produces sweat which, when it evaporates, cools the body. However, high humidity inhibits evaporation and reduces the cooling effect which leads to a greater risk of heat injury. 1-68. The extreme heat of the jungle often causes heat exhaustion and heatstroke and puts forces at risk of degraded performance. For optimum mental and physical performance, Soldiers/Marines must maintain body temperatures within narrow limits and enable the body to lose the heat it gains during work. The amount of heat accumulation in the human body depends upon the amount of physical activity, level of hydration, and the state of personal heat acclimatization. Leaders monitor their troops carefully for signs of heat distress and adjust schedules, work rates, rest, and water consumption according to conditions. 1-69. Heat injury is an environmental injury that results when a Soldier/Marine is exposed to extreme heat for extended periods. Mental sharpness and performance can be adversely affected with an increase of just two degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 Celsius) above normal. If the heat stress continues to increase and is not checked, a rise of five degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 Celsius) can result in serious illness, injury, and death. Heat stress slows reaction times and decision making; routine tasks are done more slowly. At the first evidence of heat illness, leaders have troops stop work, move into shade, and rehydrate. Early intervention is important. Heat injuries consist of heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.",
        "## Heat Rash\n1-70. Heat rash is caused by restrictive clothing, excessive sweating, and inadequate hygiene. It can develop when sweat ducts become blocked and often leads to discomfort and itching. Heat rash can prevent effective sweating and increase a Soldier/ Marine's risk for heat injury. Heat rash looks like dots or tiny pimples. The affected areas can get irritated by clothing or scratching. In rare cases, heat rash may cause a secondary skin infection.",
        "## Heat Cramps\n1-71. Heat cramps are painful muscle cramps that may occur after exposure to heat and are caused primarily by the excessive loss of mineral salts from the body. Heat cramps differ from exertional muscle cramps in that the entire muscle is not involved. Heat cramps normally involve the muscles of the arms, legs, and abdomen. Severe heat camps can render a Soldier/Marine ineffective. Heat cramps may be an early indicator of more dangerous heat injuries such as heat exhaustion.",
        "## Heat Exhaustion\n1-72. Heat exhaustion is the most common form of heat injury and generally not associated with evidence of organ damage. This condition results from excessive loss of both salt and water, usually due to profuse sweating as the body attempts to cool itself. Classic symptoms of heat exhaustion include profuse sweating, trembling, weakness, and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms may include headache, tingling in the hands and feet, paleness, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. The skin is generally cool and moist from the evaporation of sweat, the pulse rate is rapid (120 to 200 beats per minute), blood pressure may be low, and rectal temperature is usually elevated.",
        "## Heat Stroke\n1-73. Heat stroke is the most dangerous heat injury and results from the body's heat balance mechanism collapsing and the primary method of heat loss (cooling by evaporation of sweat) shutting down. Early signs of heat stroke include headache, dizziness, delirium (mental confusion), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and excessive warmth; however, sweating may or may not be absent. The most significant sign of heat stroke is a body core temperature of over 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41.1 Celsius) with a rectal temperature exceeding 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 Celsius). Although the casualty may first progress through the symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion, the onset of heat stroke may occur with dramatic suddenness. The victim of heat stroke often lose consciousness and suffer convulsions or seizures.",
        "## Heat Injury Prevention\n1-74. Heat injuries are not inevitable during jungle operations. Proactive leaders can take steps to prevent their Soldiers/Marines from becoming heat casualties. In addition to educating Soldiers/Marines on the risk factors, signs, symptoms, and prevention of heat injuries, leaders must monitor their subordinates'\nperformance and adjust work conditions to provide troops with adequate rest and recovery in accordance with the heat category.",
        "## Risk Factor Recognition\n1-75. Leaders recognize and address the following risk factors that increase the likelihood of heat injury:\nHigh heat category, especially on several sequential days. Lack of adequate meals or failure to eat.\nStrenuous training or operations over the course of several sequential days.\nExcessive heat exposure and limited recovery time.\nLack of acclimatization. Lack of sleep.\nPoor fitness (unable to run two miles in less than 16\nminutes).\nExcessive weight or obesity. The symptoms of illnesses, such as a cold, sore throat, low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nUse of medications that inhibit sweating, such as atropine, antihistamines, tranquilizers, cold medicines, and antidiarrheal medications.\nUse of alcohol to the point of intoxication in the previous\n24 hours.\nPrior history of heat injury (any heat stroke, or more than two episodes of heat exhaustion).\nSkin disorders such as heat rash or sunburn that prevent effective sweating.\nSoldiers/Marines over the age of 40. Tight clothing that restricts air flow over the body.\n1-76. Proper hydration is vital to preventing heat injuries. Leaders ensure adequate quantities of potable water are available for Soldiers/Marines during jungle operations and must encourage and monitor consumption. See paragraphs 1-94 and 1-95 for information on hydration techniques during jungle operations. 1-77. Soldiers/Marines that expend more calories than they consume increase their risk of suffering a heat injury. Soldiers/Marines may lose their desire for food in hot climates. Leaders ensure Soldiers/ Marines eat, with the heavier meal of the day scheduled during the cooler hours.",
        "1-78. Leaders use the wet bulb-globe temperature (WBGT)\nindex to accurately measure the environmental risk factors for heat injury and adjust work/rest cycles and water consumption accordingly. The wet bulb measures the combined effects of the sun, air temperature, and humidity and then classifies this data according to one of five heat categories. Leaders then adjust work to rest ratios and water consumption rates in accordance with exertion levels and the heat category. Despite this framework, leaders must recognize that nonacclimated Soldiers/Marines will likely require more water and more frequent rest periods than acclimated Soldiers/Marines. (See ATP 4-25.12 for more information on heat injury prevention, the WBGT index, and operating instructions for the WBGT index kit.) 1-79. To be effective, the wet bulb must be set up in conditions similar to those under which the Soldiers/Marines are operating and must be checked hourly when the ambient temperature is above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.8 Celsius).

        "## Modifications\n1-80. In addition to monitoring their Soldiers/ Marines' performance and the environmental conditions, leaders may modify work schedules to mitigate the risk of heat injuries. Work done in the heat of the day takes much longer and is more fatiguing than work done under relatively cooler conditions. Working during cooler periods, such as early morning, late evening, and night, not only increases productivity and reduces the likelihood of heat injuries, but it may also improve morale. 1-81. In accordance with local policy and operational conditions, commanders may modify the uniform to account for changes in the heat category. Leaders also recognize that wearing personal protective equipment (known as PPE), such as body armor, increases heat stress and adds five degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 Celsius) to the WBGT index. Performing easy work while wearing chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protective equipment adds ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 Celsius) to the WBGT, while performing moderate or hard work in CBRN protective equipment adds 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) to the WBGT index. Suggested uniform modifications include:\nHeat categories one and two-no modifications. Heat category three-unblouse trouser legs. Heat categories four and five- Unblouse trouser legs and unbuckle web belt or vest. Remove undershirt from uniform top or, if conditions permit and biting insects are not present, remove uniform top down to undershirt.\nIf conditions permit, remove helmets.",
        "## Acclimatization\n1-82. Leaders prevent heat injuries by allocating time and resources for acclimatization.\nApproximately one week of daily heat exposure is necessary to induce heat acclimatization; however, Soldiers/Marines who are unusually susceptible to heat injuries require additional time to fully acclimatize.\nHeat acclimatization requires a minimum daily heat exposure of approximately two hours that may be conducted in two, one-hour exposures. These exposures should consist of physical exercise that requires cardiovascular stress, not strength training. Leaders gradually increase the exercise intensity and duration each day to induce acclimatization. 1-83. Acclimatization to heat is necessary to permit the body to reach and maintain efficiency in its cooling process. However, situations may arise when troops cannot become fully acclimatized before leaders require them to perform hard work. When this happens, troops conduct hard work following guidelines established in table 1-1 on page 1-13, and leaders limit hard work to cooler hours and allow troops to rest frequently.",
        "## Dehydration\n1-84. Although causally related to heat injuries, dehydration may occur regardless of temperature; however, Soldiers/Marines operating in the high heat and humidity of the jungle have an increased risk for dehydration. If they do not replace bodily fluids lost through sweat, dehydration will occur. Potable drinking water is the most important need for Soldiers/Marines in the jungle. Water is easy to find in jungle environments; however, Soldiers/\nMarines should consider water from natural sources as contaminated. Maintaining adequate potable water supplies is critical. Troops cannot perform to maximum efficiency on a decreased water intake. 1-85. Leaders estimate how much water troops need and when they will need it. Before missions, leaders ensure troops properly hydrate regularly. During the mission, effective leaders take steps to ensure Soldiers/Marines replace the water lost through sweat while monitoring the water supply to prevent over consumption. After the mission, leaders ensure Soldiers/Marines replace lost fluids to support future operations. When they have limited water supply, leaders adjust their plans in accordance with the established priorities for water usage. 1-86. Monitoring hydration requires balance; leaders encourage hydration while discouraging wasteful behavior. Effective leaders also recognize that Soldiers/Marines may neglect proper hydration and hoard water if they believe it is a scarce resource. Leaders must be aware that thirst does not always adequately indicate dehydration. Adrenaline or excitement may prevent Soldiers/Marines from realizing they are thirsty or drinking adequate water before they become dehydrated.",
        "## Symptoms And Effects Of Dehydration\n1-87. Symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, weakness or fatigue, blurred vision, thirst, and dark, concentrated urine. Chronic dehydration increases the incidence of several medical problems including constipation, kidney stones, and urinary infections. 1-88. Approximately 75 percent of the human body is fluid. All chemical activities in the body occur in a water solution. Proper organ function requires water for removing waste and regulating body temperature. A loss of two quarts of body fluid (2.5 percent of body weight) decreases efficiency by 25 percent and a loss of fluid equal to 15 percent of body weight is usually fatal.\n1-89. The body has a small reserve of water and can lose some without any effects. After a loss of about two quarts (which represents about 2.5 to 3.0 percent of body weight), effectiveness is impaired. Soldiers/Marines may begin to stumble, become fatigued, lose the ability to concentrate, and develop headaches.\nThirst will be present but not overpowering. Unless well trained or reminded to drink, troops may not replace the water loss. Leaders at all levels must monitor troops and enforce proper hydration.\n1-90. As dehydration continues, the effects become more pronounced. Soldiers/Marines become less effective and more likely to become a heat casualty. Some troops will experience heat cramps, others will develop heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat cramps and heat exhaustion may be effectively treated if caught early. However, without prompt medical attention, heatstroke can prove fatal. Preventing casualties is much easier than treating and replacing casualties. 1-91. Dehydration nullifies the benefits of heat acclimatization and physical fitness; it increases the susceptibility to heat injury, reduces the capacity to work, and decreases appetite and alertness. A lack of alertness can indicate early stages of dehydration. 1-92. Dehydration is often accompanied by the loss of salt and other electrolytes necessary for bodily functions; the more Soldiers/Marines sweat, the more salt they lose. To mitigate this, the issued ration has enough salt for a Soldier/Marine drinking up to four quarts of water per day. Soldiers/Marines should attempt to get their required daily salt intake through meals provided. As they drink additional liquids to account for water lost through sweat, Soldiers/Marines eat accordingly to replace the accompanying salt lost.\nHowever, the administration of intravenous salts or saline should only occur under medical authority and supervision for Soldiers/Marines suffering from dehydration or heat injury. Salt, in excess of body requirements, may cause increased thirst and can be dangerous.",
        "## Dehydration Prevention\n1-93. While working in high jungle temperatures, a Soldier/Marine at rest may lose as much as half a quart of water per hour from sweating. If Soldiers/ Marines are working, their water loss through sweat, and the subsequent requirement for replenishment, increases in proportion to the amount of work done. Soldiers/Marines may not always drink the necessary amount of water and will need to be encouraged to drink more than they think is necessary. This is particularly true during acclimatization. Artificial flavoring or electrolyte packets may be added to water to enhance palatability and encourage consumption.\n1-94. Effective leaders understand the importance of proper hydration. The following considerations apply to proper hydration during jungle operations:\nWater is the key to health and survival. Consider water as a tactical weapon. Proper\nhydration increases individual and team effectiveness.\nWearing personal protective equipment, such\nas body armor, adds 5 degrees to the WBGT and requires increased water intake. See Table 1-1 on page 1-13 for water consumption guidelines.\nCBRN protective equipment adds 10 degrees\nto the WBGT and requires increased water intake. See Table 1-1 on page 1-13 for water consumption guidelines.\nLarger individuals require more water. As activities increase or conditions become\nmore severe, water intake needs increase in accordance with Table 1-1 on page 1-13.\nCarbohydrate and electrolyte beverages are\nnot required, but, if used, should not be the only source of water. Carbohydrate and electrolyte beverages may be diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio.\nDark urine may be an early indicator of\ndehydration; have Soldiers/Marines observe the color of their urine and report any significant changes to leadership and medical personnel.\nSalt loss can be replaced by eating meals. Diseases, especially diarrheal diseases, will\ncomplicate and often prevent proper hydration.\nConditions that increase the risk of dehydration or heat injury include, but are not limited to, fatigue or loss of sleep, previous heat injury, and prescription medication use. Modify activities and closely monitor Soldiers/Marines prone to dehydration or heat injury.\nThe first signs of heat stress and reduced effectiveness, such as a lack of sweat or chills, need treatment.\nReduced workloads and the duration of physical activity during the first days of exposure to heat and humidity and a gradual increase in workloads and physical activity facilitates acclimatization.\n1-95. To maintain the troops' welfare, leaders ensure Soldiers/ Marines-\nRest in the shade when possible. Carry as much water as possible when away\nfrom approved sources of drinking water. Soldiers/Marines can live longer without food than without water.\nProperly hydrate before hard work; fill all personal\nhydration systems prior to beginning work.\nMonitor individual consumption levels at the\nsquad level; at the platoon level, monitor the consumption rate of each squad.\nTake breaks as often as the heat condition\nrequires; during breaks, remind Soldiers/ Marines to hydrate.\nKeep water as cool as possible. Use the buddy system to encourage proper hydration.",
        "## Water Storage Techniques\n1-96. Troops protect water from enemy action as well as from heat and contamination. Excessive minerals, microbiological organisms, or other toxic substances may contaminate water. Because of this, Soldiers/Marines should avoid consuming water not yet treated by water purification specialists or medics. Troops also avoid enemy water sources in case the enemy deliberately poisoned them. 1-97. Water purification specialists or medics treat and disinfect water by adding chlorine to a level prescribed by the command surgeon. The chlorine not only kills the microbiological organisms present in the water but also kills organisms that might get into the water later. (See ATP 4-25.12 for proper chlorine dosing tables and potable water requirements.) 1-98. Water purification unit operators and medics treat and check water for contamination before distributing it to water points. However, these checks do not ensure the water will not become contaminated somewhere in the unit distribution system before a Soldier/Marine drinks it. To prevent water from becoming contaminated before consumption, units properly store treated water and prevent it from mixing with non- potable water sources, such as rain water. Units only store water in clean containers designed for water storage. The best containers for small quantities of water (five gallons or less) are plastic water cans or coolers. Troops can safely consume water properly stored in plastic cans for up to 72 hours; whereas water stored in metal containers is only potable for 24 hours. 1-99. Heat can also contaminate water. Heat reduces the disinfecting power of the chlorine dissolved in the water. If the air temperature exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), water purification specialists monitor its temperature. When the water temperature exceeds 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), they change the water to prevent the growth of bacteria. Units can reduce heat absorption by storing water cans and other containers in the shade. Field sanitation teams should have the equipment and supplies necessary to measure and maintain safe chlorine levels in water storage containers.\n1-100. Water becomes difficult to drink when warmer than 75 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 or 27 Celsius). Impurities and foul tastes are more pronounced as water becomes warmer. Water tastes best, and it is easier to drink necessary quantities of it, when between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 15 Celsius). 1-101. The type of container used to store potable water affects its temperature and palatability. Small, uninsulated water containers heat up more quickly than larger, insulated containers. When stored in direct sun in uninsulated, 5-gallon cans, 60 degree water can heat up to unpalatable temperatures in three to four hours on a hot (greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius)) day. However, this will take seven to eight hours if kept in the shade. Insulated, 400-gallon water trailers, in or out of the sun, will keep water cool for several days. Units identified to conduct jungle operations may also utilize supplemental items, such as a mobile water chiller, to keep water palatable. When they lack such equipment, Soldiers/Marines can use ice to keep water cool. If they use ice in 400-gallon (1,514 liter) water trailers, they need to remove the ice before moving the trailer to prevent damage to the inner lining of the storage tank. 1-102. Units need to make special accommodations for supplying water to mounted forces operating in the jungle. Mounted forces should carry enough water on a vehicle to last the crew until the next planned resupply. Units firmly attach water storage containers to the vehicle body to prevent excessive vibration and water loss. They keep storage containers in the shade and, if possible, exposed to an air draft. Finally, Soldiers/Marines store water containers on their vehicles where they are best protected from puncture by combat and easily dismounted in the event of a vehicle evacuation. 1-103. Leaders ensure their troops never mistake non-potable water for drinking water. Water that is not fit to drink, but is not otherwise dangerous, may be used for hygiene and other personal sanitation requirements.",
        "## Water Supply Planning\n1-104. Water supply during jungle operations requires deliberate planning. Water is heavy, requires specialized equipment to store and distribute, and must be transported long distances. It is often required in large quantities, is perishable, and is absolutely essential to mission accomplishment. Units have several specialized pieces of equipment available to overcome these challenges. The equipment's design and allocation permit units to move and store the larger than normal volumes of water required in the jungle. Units can also have this equipment delivered by ground and air transportation, airdrop, or low altitude parachute extraction system.\nAir transportation, while possible, is usually limited by aircraft availability and the weight of the quantity of water required.\nUnits normally use air transportation only in emergency situations when ground transportation is not feasible. 1-105. Planning water requirements for centralized service support functions (shower, laundry, medical treatment, maintenance, and construction) falls under the supporting organization's responsibility. The largest and most critical planning factor is drinking water. The quantity required depends on the environment, the number of troops, and the intensity of individual activity. The following questions guide unit water supply planning:\nHow much water is needed? Where is it needed? When is it needed? How will water get to the unit?\nHow does water supply affect the mission? How does the mission affect water requirements? What measures need to be taken to ensure water is properly used?\n1-106. Units provide water to support immediate and future missions. Sometimes enough water exists to fulfill all requirements; however, when supplies are limited and demand is high, the commander must prioritize water allocation by purpose. The first priority must go to the survival of the force and accomplishment of the immediate mission. A general priority for water use is-\nPersonnel (drinking only). Medical treatment. Vehicle and equipment cooling systems. Hygiene and personal sanitation.\nDecontamination. Food preparation. Laundry. Construction."

    "input": "## Chapter 1 The Jungle Environment\n\nThis chapter examines jungle regions found throughout the world and their environmental impact on personnel and equipment.\n\nJungles are harsh environments, characterized by intense heat, heavy precipitation, and thick vegetation that can adversely impact operations for unprepared forces.\n\nRestrictive terrain can limit mobility and observation while excessive heat and humidity can fatigue troops and degrade equipment. However, through preparation, acclimatization, and preventive measures, Soldiers/Marines can overcome these challenges and prevail in the dense forests, swamps, and grasslands of the world's jungles.\n\n## Jungle Regions\n\n1-1. Jungles are masses of tropical vegetation that are often tangled, overgrown, and impenetrable. Successful jungle operations require modifications to equipment and tactics as the environment can profoundly affect military operations. Primary, secondary, and savanna are the three main classifications of jungles. Primary and secondary jungles can be further classified as tropical or deciduous based upon the predominate trees. Common land features in the jungle are swamps, savannas, and cultivated areas. The large amounts of annual precipitation support incredible plant and wildlife density and diversity as well as make jungles the most ecologically rich and vibrant environments on the planet. They occur most commonly in the tropical areas of the world, mainly Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. (See figure 1-1 for locations of the major jungles.)\n1-2. Jungle climates vary with location. Close to the equator, all seasons are nearly alike, with rains throughout the year; farther from the equator, especially in India and Southwest Asia, jungles have distinct wet (monsoon) and dry seasons. Both zones have high temperatures (averaging 78 to 95+ degrees Fahrenheit [26 to 35 degrees Celsius]), heavy rainfall (as much as 394 inches [1,000 centimeters] annually), and high humidity (90 percent) throughout the year.\n\n## Jungle Types\n\n1-3. Jungles generally consist of dense forests, grasslands, cultivated areas, and swamps; however, the degree to which these features are present is used to classify the jungle by type. Jungles are classified as either primary jungles, secondary jungles, or savanna based on the terrain and vegetation.\n\n## Primary Jungles\n\n1-4. Depending on the type of trees growing in the forests, primary jungles are classified either as tropical rain forests or as deciduous forests. Unlike secondary jungles or savannas, primary jungles consist largely of old growth trees undisturbed by logging, farming, or other human activities. Primary jungles have tall trees that form a dense canopy. As such, little light penetrates to the jungle floor and undergrowth may be relatively thin. Secondary jungles exist in areas that have been previously cleared for farming or logging and are characterized by younger, shorter trees and thicker undergrowth. Savannas are natural grasslands and the few trees present are often grouped together in small groves or thickets. Figure 1-2 illustrates a primary jungle.\n\n## Tropical Rain Forests\n\n1-5. Tropical rain forests consist mostly of large trees whose branches spread and lock together to form canopies. These canopies, which can exist at two or three different levels, may form as low as 32 feet (10 meters) from the ground. The canopies prevent sunlight from reaching the ground, causing a lack of undergrowth on the jungle floor. Extensive above-ground root systems and hanging vines are common. These conditions, combined with a wet and soggy surface, make vehicular traffic difficult. Foot movement is easier in tropical rain forests than in other types of jungle. Except where felled trees create a gap in the canopy of the rain forest, observation from the air is nearly impossible. Ground observation is generally limited to 164 feet (50 meters) or less.\n\n## Deciduous Forests\n\n1-6. Deciduous forests are found in subtropical zones where both wet and dry seasons exist. These jungles generally grow between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. In the wet season, trees are fully leaved; in the dry season, some of the foliage dies. Trees generally grow less densely in deciduous forests than in rain forests. This thinner canopy allows more rain and sunlight to filter to the ground, producing thick undergrowth. The thick undergrowth of deciduous jungles has a tendency to canalize foot movement due to the deliberate efforts required to break new trail. In the wet season with the trees in full leaf, observation both from the air and on the ground is severely limited; the full leaves impact human observation, optics, and detection from aviation assets.\n\n## Secondary Jungles\n\n1-7. Secondary jungles grow predominantly at the edge of tropical rain forests and deciduous forests and in areas where jungles have been cleared and abandoned. Secondary jungles appear when the ground has been repeatedly exposed to sunlight. These areas typically display heavy overgrowth with weeds, grasses, thorns, ferns, canes, and shrubs. Foot movement is extremely slow and difficult. Vegetation may reach to a height of 6 feet (2 meters) which severely limits observation. See figure 1-3 for an example of a secondary jungle.\n\n## Savanna\n\n1-8.  Savannas are generally located away from the equator but within the tropics. Savannas consist of broad, open grasslands with few trees. The thick grass has broad-blades and grows 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 meters) high.\n\nMovement in the savanna is generally easier than in other types of jungle areas, especially for vehicles. However, the sharp-edged, dense grass and extreme heat make foot movement a slow and tiring process.\n\nGround visibility varies depending on the height of the savanna grass.\n\nConcealment from air observation is poor for both troops and vehicles. See figure 1-4 for an example of a savanna.\n\n## Jungle Features\n\n1-9.  Common jungle features include swamps, rivers, bamboo forests, and cultivated areas.\n\n## Swamps\n\n1-10. Swamps are forested wetlands. Common to all low jungle areas, swamps have lots of water and poor drainage. Swamps will affect logistical considerations in littoral operations. There are two basic types of swamps-mangrove and palm.\n\n## Mangrove Swamps\n\n1-11. Mangrove swamps grow along coastal areas wherever tides influence water flow. The mangrove is a shrub-like tree, which grows 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 meters) high. These trees have tangled root systems, both above and below the water level, which restrict movement to foot or small boats. Observation in mangrove swamps-both on the ground and from the air-is poor. Concealment is excellent.\n\n## Palm Swamps\n\n1-12. Palm swamps exist in both salt and freshwater areas. Like movement in the mangrove swamps, movement through palm swamps is mostly restricted to foot\n(sometimes small boats).\n\nVehicular traffic is nearly impossible except after extensive road construction by engineers.\n\nObservation and fields of fire are very limited. Concealment from both air and ground observation is excellent.\n\n## Bamboo\n\n1-13. Bamboo grows in clumps of varying heights in jungles throughout the tropics. Large stands of bamboo are excellent obstacles for wheeled or tracked vehicles. Troop movement on foot through bamboo is slow, exhausting, and noisy. Troops should bypass bamboo stands if possible.\n\n## Cultivated Areas\n\n1-14. Cultivated areas exist throughout the tropics and range from large, well-planned, and wellmanaged farms and plantations to small tracts cultivated by individual farmers. Rice paddies, plantations, and small farms make up the three general types of cultivated areas.\n\n## Rice Paddies\n\n1-15. Rice paddies are flat, flooded fields with muddy and soft bottoms. Farmers control the flooding of the fields with a network of dikes and irrigation ditches and fluctuate flooding with seasonal and agricultural cycles. The variable depth of flood waters directly impacts movement with higher flood waters making movement very restricted. However, travel by vehicle is difficult even when fields are dry. Concealment is poor in rice paddies. Cover is limited to the dikes, and then only from ground fire. Observation and fields of fire are excellent. Foot movement is poor when the fields are wet because troops must wade through water and soft mud that is often 20 inches (1/2 meter) deep. When the fields are dry, foot movement becomes easier. Dikes, about 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) tall, are the only obstacles.\n\n## Plantations\n\n1-16. Plantations are large farms or estates where tree crops, such as rubber and coconut, are grown. They are usually carefully planned and free of undergrowth (like a well-tended park). Movement through plantations is generally easy. Observation along the rows of trees is generally good. Cover and concealment can be found behind the trees, but troops moving down the cultivated rows are exposed.\n\n\n\n## Small Farms\n\n1-17. Small farms exist throughout the tropics. Farmers often create small farms when they clear secondary jungle to cultivate crops. Movement through these areas may be difficult due to fallen trees and scrub brush. Generally, observation and fields of fire have fewer restrictions in cultivated areas than in uncultivated jungles. However, the cultivation removes much of the natural cover and concealment leaving troops more exposed in these areas.\n\n\n\n## Weather\n\n1-18. Leaders and troops must understand that the jungle environment is neutral; it affects both friendly and enemy troops the same. Leaders and troops should reference ATP 2-01.3 and MCRP 2-10B.1 (MCRP 2-3A) when preparing estimates on the effects of terrain and weather on operations. 1-19. The degree to which troops are trained to live and fight in harsh environments will determine their unit's success or failure. High heat and humidity are key characteristics of most jungles. Humidity compounds the effects of high heat by making it more difficult for Soldiers/Marines to regulate body temperature through sweat evaporation. 1-20. Despite the obvious impact of heat and humidity, Soldiers/Marines must recognize that they will likely be exposed to cold as well. Temperatures in the jungle may drop 10 degrees or more at night. When coupled with high humidity and often rainy conditions, Soldiers/Marines may become quite uncomfortable if not properly prepared.\n\nTemperatures below freezing do not occur, but chilly nights are common. In some jungles during the winter months, the nights are cold enough to require a wool blanket or poncho liner for sleeping. At a minimum, Soldiers/Marines should replace wet clothing worn during the day with dry clothing at night. 1-21. Rainfall in many parts of the tropics is much greater than that in most temperate zones. Tropical downpours are usually followed by clear skies, and, in most places, the rains are predictable at certain times of the day. However, there are areas and times of the year where there is nearly continuous rainfall in many areas of the tropics.\n\n## Terrain\n\n1-22. Jungle terrain is varied and ranges from nearly flat savanna to impassable mountain ranges. Units preparing to deploy to specific jungle regions should seek detailed information on terrain prevalent in the expected area of operations due to the terrain variations. 1-23. Jungle terrain can canalize operations due to poor cross-country mobility, limited hardened roads and trails, and limited bridges and hardened crossing points. Some areas affect cross-country mobility with poor trafficability due to soft soils, rocky areas, mountains, dense to impenetrable vegetation, marshy areas, streams, and major rivers. Roads are usually scarce, poorly maintained, and primitive. Limited infrastructure reduces hardened crossing points over or through water features.\n\n## Observation And Fields Of Fire\n\n1-24. Observation and fields of fire are generally restricted in jungles. Steep jungle terrain, extensive and dense vegetation, and intermittent and rapidly changing atmospheric conditions restrict direct-fire weapons well short of their maximum range. The minimum engagement range of weapon systems must be considered when emplacing and employing weapons, especially for wire-guided munitions and delayed fused weapons. 1-25. Even though the landscape appears flat when viewed from above; the terrain under the dense vegetative growth can be undulating with relatively deep streams, river beds, and depressions creating significant dead space. Direct fire weapons must be sited to provide mutual support and cover dead space. Troops cover dead space by utilizing indirect fires paired with sensors or observation posts, or aerial fire assets. 1-26.\n\nWhen units cannot establish manned observation posts from dominant terrain, the only means of observation may be from manned aircraft systems, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), or electronic sensor. However, dense vegetation and weather conditions can severely limit these platforms and systems. 1-27. UASs should be used in conjunction with other unmanned and manned reconnaissance and surveillance systems in a jungle environment. Successful UAS employment in a jungle requires adequate planning for dense vegetation and other environmental factors. Depending on the platform and mission, planners and operators may have to consider the environmental factors in four separate locations: landing and recovery site, transit route, satellite relay site, and anticipated target location. (See ATP 3-04.64/ MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/ NTTP 3-55.14/AFTTP 3-2.64 and MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3-42.1] for details on planning for UASs. For UAS characteristics and employment considerations, refer to ATP 3-04.1, ATP 3-04.64/MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/ NTTP 3-55.14/AFTTP 3-2.64, and MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3- 42.1], and all applicable technical manuals.) 1-28. Troops can conduct or enhance observation using electronic devices that utilize discrete bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronically assisted observation includes radar, image intensifiers, and infrared (IR) systems that may be ground based or aerial. 1-29. Radars emit extremely short bursts of electromagnetic radiation, which are then reflected off a target and return as an echo. Several radar modes work in the jungle, including moving target indicator and synthetic aperture radar. Radar cannot positively identify a target, cannot see through buildings or terrain, and is degraded by rain and vegetation. Additionally, radar is an active electromagnetic emitter that can be sensed by threat systems. (See ATP 3-55.6/MCRP 2-10A.4 [MCRP 2-24A]/NTTP 3-55.13/AFTTP 3-2.2 for additional information regarding aerial radar operations.) 1-30. Image intensifiers, such as night vision devices (NVDs), work by amplifying visible light and the IR spectrum closest to the frequencies of visible light to create a digital picture. NVDs are passive unless paired with an illuminator for active use. Passive NVDs can operate effectively in jungle environments when ambient visible light exists. However, cloud cover, fog, inclement weather, and dense overhead vegetation negatively impact passive NVDs. (See TC 3-22.9 for more on using NVDs.) 1-31. IR imaging sensors work by amplifying the mid- and far-wavelengths of the IR band to create a digital picture representing the total IR radiation of an object and its background. IR sensors are generally passive devices. IR sensors work effectively in jungle environments in all lighting. The performance characteristics of an IR sensor determines its capabilities to see through different densities and types of atmospheric obscurants. (See ATP 3-04.64/\nMCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/NTTP 3-55.14/ AFTTP 3-2.64, MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3-42.1], and TC 3-22.9 for more information on IR sensors.) IR imaging sensors are effective during all environmental conditions. 1-32. Sensor systems operate in one of two modes:\nActive. Active sensors emit energy that reflects from targets and is recaptured by the emitting or other nearby sensor, indicating the presence of a target. Examples of active sensors are searchlights and radar.\n\nPassive. Passive sensors do not emit energy;\nthey collect energy, which may indicate the presence of a target. Examples of passive sensors are the human eye, NVDs, IR imaging devices, acoustic sensors, and photographic devices.\n\n1-33. Correction of indirect and aerial fires can be complicated in the jungle environment. Heavy tree cover can cause munitions to detonate in the overhanging branches. Troops can overcome this early detonation by using special fusing.\n\nAdditionally, troops may fail to observe the impact of rounds due to limited observation ranges requiring adjustment of fires to be conducted using other methods.\n\n## Avenues Of Approach\n\n1-34. Roads and trails crisscross many jungle areas, the majority of which are unimproved and not allweather capable. Improved all-weather roads that support wheeled vehicles are rare; complex road systems beyond simple commercial links generally do not exist. For centuries, locals have used simple roads and trails to connect centers of commerce, collection points, and natural resources such as mineral deposits and timber resources. Roads and trails in jungle regions support dismounted movement. Speed of movement varies depending on the weather, ground composition, wet gap crossings, and topographical influences. 1-35. The relatively few improved all-weather routes in many jungle areas will channelize movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles. Logistics units are heavily impacted by this scarcity and channelizing as they require improved routes in order to maintain the line of communications (LOC) for their large, mission- essential vehicles that have limited off-road trafficability. 1-36. Jungle regions use rivers and streams as highways to move large amounts of material any significant distance. These rivers and streams often have heavy overgrowth providing concealment from ground and aerial observation. The threat of fluctuating water levels due to precipitation, or the lack thereof, poses significant danger to Soldiers/ Marines and their equipment as they traverse rivers and streams. Flooding may occur even when it is not raining in the immediate area. Before crossing rivers or streams, units reconnoiter the far side of the linear obstacle for both trafficability and security. Enemy forces in covered and concealed positions can easily engage exposed Soldiers and Marines during gap crossings. 1-37. Normally mangrove and palm swamps prove impassable to all but the lightest equipped forces. Regardless, any force requires detailed reconnaissance to assess trafficability. Many jungles have swamp areas associated with rivers and streams as well as along the sea coast. Old trails or paths may cross the swamp, which are visible from the ground but invisible from aerial observation.\n\nTrafficability of swamps directly relates to the depth of the water, which can vary widely based upon precipitation and the time of the year.\n\n1-38. Exploration for and production of oil and other natural resources means wells, pipelines, refineries, quarries, and crushing plants may be of strategic importance in the jungle. Pipelines installed 3 feet (1 meter) off the ground inhibit movement. Subsurface pipelines can also create an obstacle. In Southwest Asia, maps generally indicate locations of subsurface pipelines. Often, these pipes are buried at such a shallow depth that heavy vehicles can damage them when traversing them. Furthermore, if a pipeline ruptures, not only is the spill of oil a consideration, but the fumes may be hazardous as well. 1-39. Agriculture in jungle areas typically has large effects on trafficability. The dike systems associated with rice paddies can limit surface mobility and create choke points. Large plantations create areas with great amounts of trafficability for mounted and dismounted forces. Abandoned small farms can create small pockets of secondary jungle which significantly decreases trafficability.\n\n## Key Terrain\n\n1-40. *Key terrain* is an identifiable characteristic whose seizure or retention affords a marked advantage to either combatant (ADP 3-90). Key terrain in the jungle can be any man-made feature, water crossing, water way, or high ground. Because there are few man-made features in the jungle, those that do exist can become important, perhaps even key. Bridges over waterways, regardless of size, often become key terrain due to their relative scarcity. The high ground in the jungle can be key terrain, but limited observation and fields of fire may reduce their importance. 1-41. In jungle regions, navigable waterways are extremely likely to be key terrain. They often offer the only way to move large amounts of people, supplies, and equipment significant distances relatively rapidly. The meandering routes and variability of water flows complicates their utilization and security.\n\n## Obstacles\n\n1-42. Obstacles abound in jungle regions. Jungle are generally large natural obstacles to wheeled and tracked vehicles as well as dismounted troops. Waterways, thick to impenetrable vegetation, steep slopes, swamps, water saturated soils, and mountains all hinder cross-country movement. 1-43. The few trafficable areas in the jungle are ideal for employing man-made obstacles as the natural terrain denies readily available bypass routes. Buried mines of all types are incredibly effective in jungle regions due the ability of vegetation to hide any evidence of their emplacement.\n\n1-44. Rivers and streams can pose a danger to moving units, as they can appear unexpectedly, and vehicles and personnel can fall off the elevated embankment. The embankments of a river of stream may have heavy erosion and collapse under the weight of personnel or vehicles. River and stream embankments are particularly difficult to detect when conducting operations using NVDs, with limited ambient illumination, and thick vegetation.\n\n\n\n## Water\n\n1-45. Annual precipitation rates in the jungle are the highest in the world. Many of the major rivers of the world, or their tributaries, are part of the jungle regions. The Amazon River traverses the Amazon Rainforest and is the largest river in the world. The movement and presence of water in jungle is its defining characteristic and has a large impact on military operations.\n\n\n\n## Vegetation\n\n1-46. Jungle vegetation usually grows in dense concentrations and often provides concealment from the ground and air. Numerous edible plants and shrubs grow in the jungle that Soldiers/Marines can eat in survival situations. 1-47. Many jungle plants and shrubs have toxic resins that can cause blisters. Milky sap and red beans or berries are indicative of poisonous and dangerous plants. The danger from poisonous plants in the jungle is comparable to the woods of the United States eastern seaboard. Soldiers/Marines can avoid many of the dangers associated with poisonous vegetation by keeping their sleeves down and wearing gloves when practical. (Refer to ATP 3-50.21 for more information on poisonous and edible plants.)\n\n\n\n## Wildlife\n\n1-48. Jungles host an impressive array of biodiversity and contain many animal species that can harm troops. Paragraphs 1-49 through 1-62 broadly describe various animal species that pose a threat to Soldiers/Marines. (For more information on the various plants and animals encountered in the jungle, refer to ATP 3-50.21.)\n\n## Insects\n\n1-49. Numerous biting and stinging insects inhabit the jungle. Troops with known allergies to insect bites and stings must deploy with epinephrine autoinjectors. Medical providers should have higher than normal on-hand quantities of epinephrine due to the prevalence of biting and stinging insects in the jungle.\n\n1-50. Mosquitoes are the most dangerous of the tropical insects. The largest health threat posed by mosquitoes is malaria, but mosquitoes carry numerous other diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. Additionally, mosquitoes can carry heartworm larvae that can infect military working dogs. 1-51. Precautions against malaria and other mosquito borne diseases include-\nTaking prescribed antimalarial prophylactic medication.\n\nTaking prescribed heartworm prophylactic medication (military working dogs).\n\nUsing insect repellent. Wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing that covers as much of the body as possible.\n\nUsing nets or screens at every opportunity. Avoiding the worst infested areas when possible.\n\n1-52. Mosquitoes are most prevalent early at night and just before dawn. Troops must be especially cautious at these times. Malaria is more common in populated areas than in uninhabited jungle, so troops must also be especially cautious when operating around villages. 1-53. Flies can pose a health hazard to humans; they can carry and spread diseases if not controlled. Certain flies that feed on mammals and humans can cause lesions and infections. Troops can take the following precautions to protect against flies:\nUse insect repellent. Wear permethrin-impregnated clothing that covers as much of the body as possible.\n\nUse nets or screens at every opportunity. Avoid the worst infested areas when possible.\n\n1-54. Wasps and bees are common in some jungle regions, but they will rarely attack unless their nests are disturbed. When a nest is disturbed, troops must leave the area and reassemble at the last rally point. In case of stings, Soldiers/Marines seek medical attention. 1-55. Centipedes, spiders, and scorpions that inhabit the jungle can inflict painful stings. These insects prefer dark places. As such, Soldiers/Marines should shake out sleep systems and ensure clothing and boots are free of insects before dressing. Spider bites can be painful and often require medical treatment due to necrotic tissue and secondary infection. Ants can be dangerous to troops that are lying in the prone, sleeping, or injured and unable to move. Wounded troops should be placed in an area free of ants. 1-56. In Southeast Asian jungles, the rice borer moth of the lowlands collects around lights in great numbers during certain seasons. It is a small, plaincolored moth with a pair of tiny black spots on the wings. It should never be brushed off roughly, as the small barbed hairs of its body may be ground into the skin. This causes a sore, much like a burn, that often takes weeks to heal.\n\n## Leeches\n\n1-57. Leeches are common in many jungles, particularly throughout most of the Southwest Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Malay Peninsula. They are found in swampy areas, streams, and moist jungle country. They are not venomous, but their bites may become infected if not cared for properly. The small wound that they cause may provide a point of entry for infectious diseases that cause tropical ulcers or \"jungle sores.\" Troops operating in the jungle should watch for leeches on the body and brush them off before they have had time to bite. When they have taken hold, they should not be pulled off forcibly because part of the leech may remain in the skin. Leeches will release themselves if touched with insect repellent, a moist piece of tobacco, the burning end of a cigarette, a coal from a fire, or a few drops of alcohol. 1-58. Straps wrapped around the lower part of the legs (\"leech straps\") will prevent leeches from crawling up the legs and into the crotch area.\n\nSoldiers/Marines securely blouse or tuck their trousers into their boots to hinder leech access.\n\n## Snakes\n\n1-59. While traveling in jungle environments, troops must stay alert to and avoid disturbing snakes. Troops should be particularly watchful when clearing ground. Each jungle region has certain species indigenous to the area. Before deploying, Soldiers/Marines access the electronic DOD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) for the area accessible at <https:// www.fcg.pentagon.mil/>. Section VII, \"Travel Information,\" of the guide identifies diseases caused by local insects. Units need to establish a procedure for treating snakebites. Antivenin is used to treat venomous snakebites. Antivenin is specific to a snake species; there is not a universal snake antivenin. Depending on the availability of antivenin, and the ability to properly store it, snake bite victims may require urgent medical evacuation and treatment at the next higher echelon of medical care.\n\nNote. Treat all snakebites as venomous. For treatment of\nsnakebites, refer to TC 4-02.1.\n\n## Alligators, Crocodiles, And Caimans\n\n1-60. Alligators, crocodiles, and caimans are semiaquatic carnivorous reptiles that live in tropical areas. Crocodiles are extremely sensitive to cold while alligators can endure cold temperatures. Crocodiles inhabit fresh, brackish, and salt water environments; alligators and caimans are generally fresh water reptiles. Highly effective ambush predators, numerous documented cases of alligator, crocodile, and caiman attacks on people exist throughout the world. These territorial creatures will often attack to protect their nesting areas. Troops should exercise care when conducting operations in and around water inhabited by alligators, crocodiles, or caimans.\n\n## Other Jungle Animals\n\n1-61. In the jungles of Sumatra, Bali, Borneo, Southeast Asia, and Burma there are tigers, leopards, elephants, and Asian buffalo. Latin American jungles are inhabited by the jaguar, and Africa hosts lions, leopards, buffalo, and elephants. Ordinarily, these animals will not attack unless they are cornered or wounded. 1-62. Water buffalo and elephants are used throughout Asia for agricultural and timber work. They may appear tame, but they are not truly domesticated and should only be handled by experienced trainers and handlers. Troops should avoid these animals.\n\n## Environmental Effects On Personnel\n\n1-63. Properly prepared Soldiers/Marines should have no reason to fear the jungle. The jungle is neutral and affects combatants equally. The combatant whose personnel and equipment are best prepared for jungle operations has a distinct advantage. 1-64. The jungle is fatiguing, both physically and mentally. Discipline is essential and a single lapse may jeopardize the mission and endanger Soldiers/ Marines.\n\nChallenges associated with communications, situational awareness, and movement and maneuver/maneuver require that commanders exercise a high level of leadership and train their subordinates to assume greater responsibilities. Troops with good leadership are more apt to perform well under arduous conditions. Leaders must ensure all Soldiers/Marines clearly understand why they are fighting in such harsh conditions and keep their troops informed of the operational situation. 1-65. Welfare is an essential factor to maintaining morale in a harsh environment. Welfare covers more than simply providing mail and clean clothing. Leaders need to keep troops healthy and physically fit. They must provide troops adequate, palatable, regular food, and allow them periods of rest and sleep. These things will not always be possible, and discomfort is inevitable, but if Soldiers and Marines know that their leaders are doing everything they can to make life tolerable, they will more readily accept the extremes brought on by the environment. 1-66. Climatic stress on the human body in hot jungles can stem from any combination of air temperature, humidity, air movement, and radiant heat.\n\nOther factors-lack of acclimatization, dehydration, alcohol consumption, lack of sleep, and poor health-also adversely affect the body.\n\n## Heat Injuries\n\n1-67. Jungle characteristics include high heat and humidity. Soldiers/Marines operating in the jungle have a greater risk of heat injury than Soldiers/ Marines operating in more temperate environments. To maintain an optimum temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), the body produces sweat which, when it evaporates, cools the body. However, high humidity inhibits evaporation and reduces the cooling effect which leads to a greater risk of heat injury. 1-68. The extreme heat of the jungle often causes heat exhaustion and heatstroke and puts forces at risk of degraded performance. For optimum mental and physical performance, Soldiers/Marines must maintain body temperatures within narrow limits and enable the body to lose the heat it gains during work. The amount of heat accumulation in the human body depends upon the amount of physical activity, level of hydration, and the state of personal heat acclimatization. Leaders monitor their troops carefully for signs of heat distress and adjust schedules, work rates, rest, and water consumption according to conditions. 1-69. Heat injury is an environmental injury that results when a Soldier/Marine is exposed to extreme heat for extended periods. Mental sharpness and performance can be adversely affected with an increase of just two degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 Celsius) above normal. If the heat stress continues to increase and is not checked, a rise of five degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 Celsius) can result in serious illness, injury, and death. Heat stress slows reaction times and decision making; routine tasks are done more slowly. At the first evidence of heat illness, leaders have troops stop work, move into shade, and rehydrate. Early intervention is important. Heat injuries consist of heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\n\n## Heat Rash\n\n1-70. Heat rash is caused by restrictive clothing, excessive sweating, and inadequate hygiene. It can develop when sweat ducts become blocked and often leads to discomfort and itching. Heat rash can prevent effective sweating and increase a Soldier/ Marine's risk for heat injury. Heat rash looks like dots or tiny pimples. The affected areas can get irritated by clothing or scratching. In rare cases, heat rash may cause a secondary skin infection.\n\n## Heat Cramps\n\n1-71. Heat cramps are painful muscle cramps that may occur after exposure to heat and are caused primarily by the excessive loss of mineral salts from the body. Heat cramps differ from exertional muscle cramps in that the entire muscle is not involved. Heat cramps normally involve the muscles of the arms, legs, and abdomen. Severe heat camps can render a Soldier/Marine ineffective. Heat cramps may be an early indicator of more dangerous heat injuries such as heat exhaustion.\n\n## Heat Exhaustion\n\n1-72. Heat exhaustion is the most common form of heat injury and generally not associated with evidence of organ damage. This condition results from excessive loss of both salt and water, usually due to profuse sweating as the body attempts to cool itself. Classic symptoms of heat exhaustion include profuse sweating, trembling, weakness, and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms may include headache, tingling in the hands and feet, paleness, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. The skin is generally cool and moist from the evaporation of sweat, the pulse rate is rapid (120 to 200 beats per minute), blood pressure may be low, and rectal temperature is usually elevated.\n\n## Heat Stroke\n\n1-73. Heat stroke is the most dangerous heat injury and results from the body's heat balance mechanism collapsing and the primary method of heat loss (cooling by evaporation of sweat) shutting down. Early signs of heat stroke include headache, dizziness, delirium (mental confusion), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and excessive warmth; however, sweating may or may not be absent. The most significant sign of heat stroke is a body core temperature of over 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41.1 Celsius) with a rectal temperature exceeding 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 Celsius). Although the casualty may first progress through the symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion, the onset of heat stroke may occur with dramatic suddenness. The victim of heat stroke often lose consciousness and suffer convulsions or seizures.\n\n## Heat Injury Prevention\n\n1-74. Heat injuries are not inevitable during jungle operations. Proactive leaders can take steps to prevent their Soldiers/Marines from becoming heat casualties. In addition to educating Soldiers/Marines on the risk factors, signs, symptoms, and prevention of heat injuries, leaders must monitor their subordinates'\nperformance and adjust work conditions to provide troops with adequate rest and recovery in accordance with the heat category.\n\n## Risk Factor Recognition\n\n1-75. Leaders recognize and address the following risk factors that increase the likelihood of heat injury:\nHigh heat category, especially on several sequential days. Lack of adequate meals or failure to eat.\n\nStrenuous training or operations over the course of several sequential days.\n\nExcessive heat exposure and limited recovery time.\n\nLack of acclimatization. Lack of sleep.\n\nPoor fitness (unable to run two miles in less than 16\nminutes).\n\nExcessive weight or obesity. The symptoms of illnesses, such as a cold, sore throat, low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nUse of medications that inhibit sweating, such as atropine, antihistamines, tranquilizers, cold medicines, and antidiarrheal medications.\n\nUse of alcohol to the point of intoxication in the previous\n24 hours.\n\nPrior history of heat injury (any heat stroke, or more than two episodes of heat exhaustion).\n\nSkin disorders such as heat rash or sunburn that prevent effective sweating.\n\nSoldiers/Marines over the age of 40. Tight clothing that restricts air flow over the body.\n\n1-76. Proper hydration is vital to preventing heat injuries. Leaders ensure adequate quantities of potable water are available for Soldiers/Marines during jungle operations and must encourage and monitor consumption. See paragraphs 1-94 and 1-95 for information on hydration techniques during jungle operations. 1-77. Soldiers/Marines that expend more calories than they consume increase their risk of suffering a heat injury. Soldiers/Marines may lose their desire for food in hot climates. Leaders ensure Soldiers/ Marines eat, with the heavier meal of the day scheduled during the cooler hours.\n\n1-78. Leaders use the wet bulb-globe temperature (WBGT)\nindex to accurately measure the environmental risk factors for heat injury and adjust work/rest cycles and water consumption accordingly. The wet bulb measures the combined effects of the sun, air temperature, and humidity and then classifies this data according to one of five heat categories. Leaders then adjust work to rest ratios and water consumption rates in accordance with exertion levels and the heat category. Despite this framework, leaders must recognize that nonacclimated Soldiers/Marines will likely require more water and more frequent rest periods than acclimated Soldiers/Marines. (See ATP 4-25.12 for more information on heat injury prevention, the WBGT index, and operating instructions for the WBGT index kit.) 1-79. To be effective, the wet bulb must be set up in conditions similar to those under which the Soldiers/Marines are operating and must be checked hourly when the ambient temperature is above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.8 Celsius).

In addition to monitoring their Soldiers/ Marines' performance and the environmental conditions, leaders may modify work schedules to mitigate the risk of heat injuries. Work done in the heat of the day takes much longer and is more fatiguing than work done under relatively cooler conditions. Working during cooler periods, such as early morning, late evening, and night, not only increases productivity and reduces the likelihood of heat injuries, but it may also improve morale. 1-81. In accordance with local policy and operational conditions, commanders may modify the uniform to account for changes in the heat category. Leaders also recognize that wearing personal protective equipment (known as PPE), such as body armor, increases heat stress and adds five degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 Celsius) to the WBGT index. Performing easy work while wearing chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protective equipment adds ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 Celsius) to the WBGT, while performing moderate or hard work in CBRN protective equipment adds 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) to the WBGT index. Suggested uniform modifications include:\nHeat categories one and two-no modifications. Heat category three-unblouse trouser legs. Heat categories four and five- Unblouse trouser legs and unbuckle web belt or vest. Remove undershirt from uniform top or, if conditions permit and biting insects are not present, remove uniform top down to undershirt.\n\nIf conditions permit, remove helmets.\n\n## Acclimatization\n\n1-82. Leaders prevent heat injuries by allocating time and resources for acclimatization.\n\nApproximately one week of daily heat exposure is necessary to induce heat acclimatization; however, Soldiers/Marines who are unusually susceptible to heat injuries require additional time to fully acclimatize.\n\nHeat acclimatization requires a minimum daily heat exposure of approximately two hours that may be conducted in two, one-hour exposures. These exposures should consist of physical exercise that requires cardiovascular stress, not strength training. Leaders gradually increase the exercise intensity and duration each day to induce acclimatization. 1-83. Acclimatization to heat is necessary to permit the body to reach and maintain efficiency in its cooling process. However, situations may arise when troops cannot become fully acclimatized before leaders require them to perform hard work. When this happens, troops conduct hard work following guidelines established in table 1-1 on page 1-13, and leaders limit hard work to cooler hours and allow troops to rest frequently.\n\n## Dehydration\n\n1-84. Although causally related to heat injuries, dehydration may occur regardless of temperature; however, Soldiers/Marines operating in the high heat and humidity of the jungle have an increased risk for dehydration. If they do not replace bodily fluids lost through sweat, dehydration will occur. Potable drinking water is the most important need for Soldiers/Marines in the jungle. Water is easy to find in jungle environments; however, Soldiers/\nMarines should consider water from natural sources as contaminated. Maintaining adequate potable water supplies is critical. Troops cannot perform to maximum efficiency on a decreased water intake. 1-85. Leaders estimate how much water troops need and when they will need it. Before missions, leaders ensure troops properly hydrate regularly. During the mission, effective leaders take steps to ensure Soldiers/Marines replace the water lost through sweat while monitoring the water supply to prevent over consumption. After the mission, leaders ensure Soldiers/Marines replace lost fluids to support future operations. When they have limited water supply, leaders adjust their plans in accordance with the established priorities for water usage. 1-86. Monitoring hydration requires balance; leaders encourage hydration while discouraging wasteful behavior. Effective leaders also recognize that Soldiers/Marines may neglect proper hydration and hoard water if they believe it is a scarce resource. Leaders must be aware that thirst does not always adequately indicate dehydration. Adrenaline or excitement may prevent Soldiers/Marines from realizing they are thirsty or drinking adequate water before they become dehydrated.\n\n## Symptoms And Effects Of Dehydration\n\n1-87. Symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, weakness or fatigue, blurred vision, thirst, and dark, concentrated urine. Chronic dehydration increases the incidence of several medical problems including constipation, kidney stones, and urinary infections. 1-88. Approximately 75 percent of the human body is fluid. All chemical activities in the body occur in a water solution. Proper organ function requires water for removing waste and regulating body temperature. A loss of two quarts of body fluid (2.5 percent of body weight) decreases efficiency by 25 percent and a loss of fluid equal to 15 percent of body weight is usually fatal.\n\n1-89. The body has a small reserve of water and can lose some without any effects. After a loss of about two quarts (which represents about 2.5 to 3.0 percent of body weight), effectiveness is impaired. Soldiers/Marines may begin to stumble, become fatigued, lose the ability to concentrate, and develop headaches.\n\nThirst will be present but not overpowering. Unless well trained or reminded to drink, troops may not replace the water loss. Leaders at all levels must monitor troops and enforce proper hydration.\n\n1-90. As dehydration continues, the effects become more pronounced. Soldiers/Marines become less effective and more likely to become a heat casualty. Some troops will experience heat cramps, others will develop heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat cramps and heat exhaustion may be effectively treated if caught early. However, without prompt medical attention, heatstroke can prove fatal. Preventing casualties is much easier than treating and replacing casualties. 1-91. Dehydration nullifies the benefits of heat acclimatization and physical fitness; it increases the susceptibility to heat injury, reduces the capacity to work, and decreases appetite and alertness. A lack of alertness can indicate early stages of dehydration. 1-92. Dehydration is often accompanied by the loss of salt and other electrolytes necessary for bodily functions; the more Soldiers/Marines sweat, the more salt they lose. To mitigate this, the issued ration has enough salt for a Soldier/Marine drinking up to four quarts of water per day. Soldiers/Marines should attempt to get their required daily salt intake through meals provided. As they drink additional liquids to account for water lost through sweat, Soldiers/Marines eat accordingly to replace the accompanying salt lost.\n\nHowever, the administration of intravenous salts or saline should only occur under medical authority and supervision for Soldiers/Marines suffering from dehydration or heat injury. Salt, in excess of body requirements, may cause increased thirst and can be dangerous.\n\n## Dehydration Prevention\n\n1-93. While working in high jungle temperatures, a Soldier/Marine at rest may lose as much as half a quart of water per hour from sweating. If Soldiers/ Marines are working, their water loss through sweat, and the subsequent requirement for replenishment, increases in proportion to the amount of work done. Soldiers/Marines may not always drink the necessary amount of water and will need to be encouraged to drink more than they think is necessary. This is particularly true during acclimatization. Artificial flavoring or electrolyte packets may be added to water to enhance palatability and encourage consumption.\n\n1-94. Effective leaders understand the importance of proper hydration. The following considerations apply to proper hydration during jungle operations:\nWater is the key to health and survival. Consider water as a tactical weapon. Proper\nhydration increases individual and team effectiveness.\nWearing personal protective equipment, such\nas body armor, adds 5 degrees to the WBGT and requires increased water intake. See Table 1-1 on page 1-13 for water consumption guidelines.\nCBRN protective equipment adds 10 degrees\nto the WBGT and requires increased water intake. See Table 1-1 on page 1-13 for water consumption guidelines.\nLarger individuals require more water. As activities increase or conditions become\nmore severe, water intake needs increase in accordance with Table 1-1 on page 1-13.\nCarbohydrate and electrolyte beverages are\nnot required, but, if used, should not be the only source of water. Carbohydrate and electrolyte beverages may be diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio.\nDark urine may be an early indicator of\ndehydration; have Soldiers/Marines observe the color of their urine and report any significant changes to leadership and medical personnel.\nSalt loss can be replaced by eating meals. Diseases, especially diarrheal diseases, will\ncomplicate and often prevent proper hydration.\n\nConditions that increase the risk of dehydration or heat injury include, but are not limited to, fatigue or loss of sleep, previous heat injury, and prescription medication use. Modify activities and closely monitor Soldiers/Marines prone to dehydration or heat injury.\n\nThe first signs of heat stress and reduced effectiveness, such as a lack of sweat or chills, need treatment.\n\nReduced workloads and the duration of physical activity during the first days of exposure to heat and humidity and a gradual increase in workloads and physical activity facilitates acclimatization.\n\n1-95. To maintain the troops' welfare, leaders ensure Soldiers/ Marines-\n\nRest in the shade when possible. Carry as much water as possible when away\nfrom approved sources of drinking water. Soldiers/Marines can live longer without food than without water.\nProperly hydrate before hard work; fill all personal\nhydration systems prior to beginning work.\nMonitor individual consumption levels at the\nsquad level; at the platoon level, monitor the consumption rate of each squad.\nTake breaks as often as the heat condition\nrequires; during breaks, remind Soldiers/ Marines to hydrate.\nKeep water as cool as possible. Use the buddy system to encourage proper hydration.\n\n## Water Storage Techniques\n\n1-96. Troops protect water from enemy action as well as from heat and contamination. Excessive minerals, microbiological organisms, or other toxic substances may contaminate water. Because of this, Soldiers/Marines should avoid consuming water not yet treated by water purification specialists or medics. Troops also avoid enemy water sources in case the enemy deliberately poisoned them. 1-97. Water purification specialists or medics treat and disinfect water by adding chlorine to a level prescribed by the command surgeon. The chlorine not only kills the microbiological organisms present in the water but also kills organisms that might get into the water later. (See ATP 4-25.12 for proper chlorine dosing tables and potable water requirements.) 1-98. Water purification unit operators and medics treat and check water for contamination before distributing it to water points. However, these checks do not ensure the water will not become contaminated somewhere in the unit distribution system before a Soldier/Marine drinks it. To prevent water from becoming contaminated before consumption, units properly store treated water and prevent it from mixing with non- potable water sources, such as rain water. Units only store water in clean containers designed for water storage. The best containers for small quantities of water (five gallons or less) are plastic water cans or coolers. Troops can safely consume water properly stored in plastic cans for up to 72 hours; whereas water stored in metal containers is only potable for 24 hours. 1-99. Heat can also contaminate water. Heat reduces the disinfecting power of the chlorine dissolved in the water. If the air temperature exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), water purification specialists monitor its temperature. When the water temperature exceeds 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), they change the water to prevent the growth of bacteria. Units can reduce heat absorption by storing water cans and other containers in the shade. Field sanitation teams should have the equipment and supplies necessary to measure and maintain safe chlorine levels in water storage containers.\n\n1-100. Water becomes difficult to drink when warmer than 75 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 or 27 Celsius). Impurities and foul tastes are more pronounced as water becomes warmer. Water tastes best, and it is easier to drink necessary quantities of it, when between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 15 Celsius). 1-101. The type of container used to store potable water affects its temperature and palatability. Small, uninsulated water containers heat up more quickly than larger, insulated containers. When stored in direct sun in uninsulated, 5-gallon cans, 60 degree water can heat up to unpalatable temperatures in three to four hours on a hot (greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius)) day. However, this will take seven to eight hours if kept in the shade. Insulated, 400-gallon water trailers, in or out of the sun, will keep water cool for several days. Units identified to conduct jungle operations may also utilize supplemental items, such as a mobile water chiller, to keep water palatable. When they lack such equipment, Soldiers/Marines can use ice to keep water cool. If they use ice in 400-gallon (1,514 liter) water trailers, they need to remove the ice before moving the trailer to prevent damage to the inner lining of the storage tank. 1-102. Units need to make special accommodations for supplying water to mounted forces operating in the jungle. Mounted forces should carry enough water on a vehicle to last the crew until the next planned resupply. Units firmly attach water storage containers to the vehicle body to prevent excessive vibration and water loss. They keep storage containers in the shade and, if possible, exposed to an air draft. Finally, Soldiers/Marines store water containers on their vehicles where they are best protected from puncture by combat and easily dismounted in the event of a vehicle evacuation. 1-103. Leaders ensure their troops never mistake non-potable water for drinking water. Water that is not fit to drink, but is not otherwise dangerous, may be used for hygiene and other personal sanitation requirements.\n\n## Water Supply Planning\n\n1-104. Water supply during jungle operations requires deliberate planning. Water is heavy, requires specialized equipment to store and distribute, and must be transported long distances. It is often required in large quantities, is perishable, and is absolutely essential to mission accomplishment. Units have several specialized pieces of equipment available to overcome these challenges. The equipment's design and allocation permit units to move and store the larger than normal volumes of water required in the jungle. Units can also have this equipment delivered by ground and air transportation, airdrop, or low altitude parachute extraction system.\n\nAir transportation, while possible, is usually limited by aircraft availability and the weight of the quantity of water required.\n\nUnits normally use air transportation only in emergency situations when ground transportation is not feasible. 1-105. Planning water requirements for centralized service support functions (shower, laundry, medical treatment, maintenance, and construction) falls under the supporting organization's responsibility. The largest and most critical planning factor is drinking water. The quantity required depends on the environment, the number of troops, and the intensity of individual activity. The following questions guide unit water supply planning:\nHow much water is needed? Where is it needed? When is it needed? How will water get to the unit?\n\nHow does water supply affect the mission? How does the mission affect water requirements? What measures need to be taken to ensure water is properly used?\n\n1-106. Units provide water to support immediate and future missions. Sometimes enough water exists to fulfill all requirements; however, when supplies are limited and demand is high, the commander must prioritize water allocation by purpose. The first priority must go to the survival of the force and accomplishment of the immediate mission. A general priority for water use is-\nPersonnel (drinking only). Medical treatment. Vehicle and equipment cooling systems. Hygiene and personal sanitation.\n\nDecontamination. Food preparation. Laundry. Construction.",
