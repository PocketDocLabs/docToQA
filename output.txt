5 Ignition system - general
The ignition system includes the ignition switch, the battery, the distributor, the primary (low-voltage/low-tension or LT) and secondary (high-voltage/high-tension or HT) wiring circuits, the spark plugs and the spark plug leads. Models fitted with a carburettor or L-Jetronic fuel injection are equipped with a Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system. Models fitted with the Motronic fuel injection system have the ignition system incorporated within the Motronic system (Digital Motor Electronics or DME).

Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system
This system is has four major components; the impulse generator, the ignition control unit, the coil, and the spark plugs. The impulse generator provides a timing signal for the ignition system. Equivalent to cam- actuated breaker points in a standard distributor, the impulse generator creates an A/C voltage signal every time the trigger wheel tabs pass the impulse generator tabs. When the ignition control unit (capacitive discharge unit) receives the voltage signal, it triggers a spark discharge from the coil by interrupting the primary coil circuit. The ignition dwell (coil charging time) is adjusted by the ignition control unit for the most intense spark. Note: The air gap (distance between the impulse generator and trigger wheel tabs) can be adjusted (see Section 11). Ignition timing is mechanically adjusted (see Section 7). A centrifugal advance unit that consists of spring-loaded rotating weights advances ignition timing as engine speed increases. The vacuum advance adjusts ignition timing to compensate for changes in engine load.

Motronic ignition system
This system, also known as Digital Motor Electronics (DME), incorporates all ignition and fuel injection functions into one central control unit or ECU (computer). The ignition timing is based on inputs the ECU receives for engine load, engine speed, coolant temperature and intake air temperature. The only function the distributor performs is the distribution of the high voltage signal to the individual spark plugs. The distributor is attached directly to the cylinder head. There is no mechanical spark advance system used on these systems. Ignition timing is electronically-controlled, and is not adjustable on Motronic systems. During starting, a crankshaft position sensor (reference sensor) relays the crankshaft position to the ECU, and an initial baseline ignition point is determined. Once the engine is running, the ignition timing is continually changing, based on the various input signals to the ECU. Engine speed is signalled by a speed sensor. Early Motronic systems have the position reference sensor and the speed sensor mounted on the bellhousing over the flywheel on the left-hand side. Later Motronic systems have a single sensor (pulse sensor) mounted over the crankshaft pulley. This sensor functions as a speed sensor as well as a position reference sensor. Refer to Sec- tion 12 for checking and renewing the ignition sensors. Note: Some models are equipped with a TDC sensor mounted on the front of the engine. This sensor is strictly for the BMW service test unit, and it is not part of the Motronic ignition system.

Precautions
Certain precautions must be observed when working on a transistorised ignition system.
a) Do not disconnect the battery cables when the engine is running
b) Make sure the ignition control unit (TCI ignition system) is always well earthed (see Section 10).
c) Keep water away from the distributor and HT leads.
d) If a tachometer is to be connected to the engine, always connect the tachometer positive (+) lead to the ignition coil negative terminal (-) and never to the distributor.
e) Do not allow the coil terminals to be earthed, as the impulse generator or coil could be damaged.
f) Do not leave the ignition switch on for more than ten minutes with the engine off, or if the engine will not start.

 6 Ignition system - check 2
Warning: Because of the high voltage generated by the ignition system, extreme care should be taken whenever an operation is performed involving ignition components. This not only includes the impulse generator (electronic ignition), coil, distributor and spark plug HT leads, but related components such as spark plug connectors, tachometer and other test equipment.
1 If the engine turns over but will not start, disconnect the spark plug HT lead from any spark plug, and attach it to a calibrated spark tester (available at most car accessory  shops).
</split>

<split>
 Note: There are two different types of spark testers. Be sure to specify electronic (breakerless) ignition. Connect the clip on the tester to an earth point such as a metal bracket (see illustration).
2 If you are unable to obtain a calibrated spark tester, remove the spark plug HT lead from one of the spark plugs. Using an insulated tool, hold the lead about a quarter- inch from the engine block - make sure the gap is not more than a quarter-inch, or damage may be caused to the electronic components.
3 Crank the engine, and observe the tip of the tester or spark plug HT lead to see if a spark occurs. If bright-blue, well-defined sparks occur, sufficient voltage is reaching the plugs to fire the engine. However, the plugs themselves may be fouled, so remove and check them as described in Chapter 1.
4 If there’s no spark, check another HT lead in the same manner. A few sparks followed by no spark is the same condition as no spark at all.
5 If no spark occurs, remove the distributor cap, and check the cap and rotor as described in Chapter 1. If moisture is present, use a water-dispersant aerosol (or something similar) to dry out the cap and rotor, then refit the cap and repeat the spark test.
6 If there’s still no spark, disconnect the coil HT lead from the distributor cap, and  test this lead as described for the spark plug leads.
7 If no spark occurs, check the primary wire connections at the coil to make sure they’re clean and tight. Make any necessary repairs, then repeat the check.
8 If sparks do occur from the coil HT lead, the distributor cap, rotor, plug HT lead(s) or spark plug(s) may be defective. If there’s still no spark, the coil-to-cap HT lead may be defective. If a substitute lead doesn’t make any difference, check the ignition coil (see Section 9). Note: Refer to Sections 10 and 11 for more test procedures on the distributors fitted with the TCI ignition system.

7 Ignition timing (TCI system) - check and adjustment 4
Warning: Keep hands, equipment and wires well clear of the viscous cooling fan during adjustment of the ignition timing.
Note: This Section describes the procedure for checking and adjusting the ignition timing on engines fitted with the TCI system. On engines fitted with the Motronic engine management system, the ignition timing is controlled by the electronic control unit, and no adjustment is possible. The timing can be checked using the following procedure, but no ignition timing values were available at the time of writing. If the timing is thought to be incorrect, refer to a BMW dealer.
1 Some special tools are required for this procedure (see illustration). The engine must be at normal operating temperature, and the air conditioning (where fitted) must be switched off. Make sure the idle speed is correct.
2 Apply the handbrake, and chock the wheels to prevent movement of the vehicle. The transmission must be in neutral (manual) or Park (automatic).
3 The timing marks are located on the engine flywheel (viewed through the timing check hole in the bellhousing) and/or on the vibration damper on the front of the engine.
4 Where applicable, disconnect the vacuum hose from the distributor vacuum advance unit.
5 Connect a tachometer and timing light according to the equipment manufacturer’s instructions (an inductive pick-up timing light is preferred). Generally, the power leads for the timing light are attached to the battery terminals, and the pick-up lead is attached to the No 1 spark plug HT lead. The No 1 spark plug is the one at the front of the engine.
Caution: If an inductive pick-up timing light isn’t available, don’t puncture the spark plug HT lead to attach the timing light pick-up lead. Instead, use an adapter between the spark plug and HT lead. If the insulation on the HT lead is damaged, the secondary voltage will jump to earth at the damaged point, and the engine will misfire.
Note: On some models, a TDC transmitter is fitted for checking the ignition system. However, a special BMW tester must be connected to the diagnostic socket to use it, so unless the special tester is available, a conventional timing light should be used. The ignition timing mark may be on the vibration damper, but if not, normally the TDC mark will be. If the timing light is of the adjustable delay type, then the ignition timing may be determined by zeroing the adjustment, then turning the adjustment until the TDC marks are aligned, and then reading off the amount of advance from the timing light. If a standard timing light is being used, make a mark on the vibration damper in accordance with the specified advance, using the following formula to calculate the distance from the TDC mark to the timing mark:
Distance = 2Pr x advance
360
where P = 3.142
r = radius of vibration damper
advance = specified advance  BTDC in degrees
6 With the ignition off, loosen the distributor clamp nut just enough to allow the distributor to pivot without any slipping.
7 Make sure the timing light wires are routed away from the drivebelts and fan, then start the engine.
8 Raise the engine rpm to the specified speed, and then point the flashing timing light at the timing marks - be very careful of moving engine components.
9 The mark on the flywheel or vibration damper will appear stationary. If it’s aligned with the specified point on the bellhousing or engine front cover, the ignition timing is correct (see illustrations).
10 If the marks aren’t aligned, adjustment is required. Turn the distributor very slowly until the marks are aligned, taking care not to touch the HT leads.
11 Tighten the nut on the distributor clamp, and recheck the timing.
12 Switch off the engine, and remove the timing light and tachometer. Reconnect the vacuum hose where applicable.

9 Ignition coil - check and renewal 2
Caution: Do not earth the coil, as
the coil and/or impulse generator
could be damaged.
Note: On models equipped with the Motronic
system, a faulty ECU can cause the ignition
coil to become damaged. Be sure to test the
ignition coil if the engine will not start and an
ECU fault is suspected.
1 Mark the wires and terminals for position,
then remove the primary circuit wires and the
HT lead from the coil.
2 Remove the coil assembly from its
mounting, then clean the outer casing and
check it for cracks and other damage.
3 Inspect the coil primary terminals and the
coil tower terminal for corrosion. Clean them
with a wire brush if any corrosion is found.
4 Check the coil primary resistance by
attaching an ohmmeter to the primary
terminals (see illustrations). Compare the
measured resistance to the Specifications
listed in this Chapter.
5 Check the coil secondary resistance by
connecting one of the ohmmeter leads to one
of the primary terminals, and the other
ohmmeter lead to the coil high-tension
terminal (see illustrations). On TCI systems,

6 If the measured resistances are not close to those specified, the coil is defective and should be renewed. Note that the measured resistance will vary according to the temperature of the coil, so don’t rush to condemn the coil if the resistance is only a little way out.
7 It is essential for proper ignition system operation that all coil terminals and wire leads be kept clean and dry.

10 Impulse generator and ignition control unit - check and renewal (TCI system)
3
1 The impulse generator (located in the distributor) and ignition control unit need to be tested in the event there is no spark at the spark plugs. Make sure the plug leads, ignition coil and spark plugs are working properly (see Sections 6 and 9). There are two types of control units; Bosch or Siemens/Telefunken. The two types (see illustration) can be distinguished by their electrical connectors. The Bosch type uses a single, large rectangular connector at the bottom of the unit, while the Siemens/Telefunken control unit uses two round electrical connectors at the front of the unit.
Check
Voltage supply and earth to ignition control unit
2 With the ignition off, remove the harness connectors from the ignition control unit (see illustrations). Connect a voltmeter between connector terminals 2 and 4 on Bosch systems, or between terminals 6 and 3 on Siemens/Telefunken systems.
3 Turn the ignition on. There should be battery voltage on the designated terminals. If there is no voltage, check the wiring harness for an open-circuit (see Chapter 12).
4 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity between connector terminal 2 (Bosch) or 6 (Siemens/Telefunken) and the earth to the vehicle body. Continuity should exist.
5 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity between connector terminal 4 (Bosch) or 3 (Siemens/Telefunken) and terminal 15 of the ignition coil. Continuity should exist.
6 If the readings are incorrect, repair the wiring harness.
