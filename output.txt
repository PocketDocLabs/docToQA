## Chapter 1 The Jungle Environment

This chapter examines jungle regions found throughout the world and their environmental impact on personnel and equipment.

</split>

<split>
Jungles are harsh environments, characterized by intense heat, heavy precipitation, and thick vegetation that can adversely impact operations for unprepared forces.

</split>

<split>
Restrictive terrain can limit mobility and observation while excessive heat and humidity can fatigue troops and degrade equipment. However, through preparation, acclimatization, and preventive measures, Soldiers/Marines can overcome these challenges and prevail in the dense forests, swamps, and grasslands of the world's jungles.

</split>

<split>
## Jungle Regions

1-1. Jungles are masses of tropical vegetation that are often tangled, overgrown, and impenetrable. Successful jungle operations require modifications to equipment and tactics as the environment can profoundly affect military operations. Primary, secondary, and savanna are the three main classifications of jungles. Primary and secondary jungles can be further classified as tropical or deciduous based upon the predominate trees. Common land features in the jungle are swamps, savannas, and cultivated areas. The large amounts of annual precipitation support incredible plant and wildlife density and diversity as well as make jungles the most ecologically rich and vibrant environments on the planet. They occur most commonly in the tropical areas of the world, mainly Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. (See figure 1-1 for locations of the major jungles.)
1-2. Jungle climates vary with location. Close to the equator, all seasons are nearly alike, with rains throughout the year; farther from the equator, especially in India and Southwest Asia, jungles have distinct wet (monsoon) and dry seasons. Both zones have high temperatures (averaging 78 to 95+ degrees Fahrenheit [26 to 35 degrees Celsius]), heavy rainfall (as much as 394 inches [1,000 centimeters] annually), and high humidity (90 percent) throughout the year.

</split>

<split>
## Jungle Types

1-3. Jungles generally consist of dense forests, grasslands, cultivated areas, and swamps; however, the degree to which these features are present is used to classify the jungle by type. Jungles are classified as either primary jungles, secondary jungles, or savanna based on the terrain and vegetation.

</split>

<split>
## Primary Jungles

1-4. Depending on the type of trees growing in the forests, primary jungles are classified either as tropical rain forests or as deciduous forests. Unlike secondary jungles or savannas, primary jungles consist largely of old growth trees undisturbed by logging, farming, or other human activities. Primary jungles have tall trees that form a dense canopy. As such, little light penetrates to the jungle floor and undergrowth may be relatively thin. Secondary jungles exist in areas that have been previously cleared for farming or logging and are characterized by younger, shorter trees and thicker undergrowth. Savannas are natural grasslands and the few trees present are often grouped together in small groves or thickets. Figure 1-2 illustrates a primary jungle.

</split>

<split>
## Tropical Rain Forests

1-5. Tropical rain forests consist mostly of large trees whose branches spread and lock together to form canopies. These canopies, which can exist at two or three different levels, may form as low as 32 feet (10 meters) from the ground. The canopies prevent sunlight from reaching the ground, causing a lack of undergrowth on the jungle floor. Extensive above-ground root systems and hanging vines are common. These conditions, combined with a wet and soggy surface, make vehicular traffic difficult. Foot movement is easier in tropical rain forests than in other types of jungle. Except where felled trees create a gap in the canopy of the rain forest, observation from the air is nearly impossible. Ground observation is generally limited to 164 feet (50 meters) or less.

</split>

<split>
## Deciduous Forests

1-6. Deciduous forests are found in subtropical zones where both wet and dry seasons exist. These jungles generally grow between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. In the wet season, trees are fully leaved; in the dry season, some of the foliage dies. Trees generally grow less densely in deciduous forests than in rain forests. This thinner canopy allows more rain and sunlight to filter to the ground, producing thick undergrowth. The thick undergrowth of deciduous jungles has a tendency to canalize foot movement due to the deliberate efforts required to break new trail. In the wet season with the trees in full leaf, observation both from the air and on the ground is severely limited; the full leaves impact human observation, optics, and detection from aviation assets.

</split>

<split>
## Secondary Jungles

1-7. Secondary jungles grow predominantly at the edge of tropical rain forests and deciduous forests and in areas where jungles have been cleared and abandoned. Secondary jungles appear when the ground has been repeatedly exposed to sunlight. These areas typically display heavy overgrowth with weeds, grasses, thorns, ferns, canes, and shrubs. Foot movement is extremely slow and difficult. Vegetation may reach to a height of 6 feet (2 meters) which severely limits observation. See figure 1-3 for an example of a secondary jungle.

</split>

<split>
## Savanna

1-8. Savannas are generally located away from the equator but within the tropics. Savannas consist of broad, open grasslands with few trees. The thick grass has broad-blades and grows 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 meters) high.

</split>

<split>
Movement in the savanna is generally easier than in other types of jungle areas, especially for vehicles. However, the sharp-edged, dense grass and extreme heat make foot movement a slow and tiring process.

</split>

<split>
Ground visibility varies depending on the height of the savanna grass.

</split>

<split>
Concealment from air observation is poor for both troops and vehicles. See figure 1-4 for an example of a savanna.

</split>

<split>
## Jungle Features

1-9. Common jungle features include swamps, rivers, bamboo forests, and cultivated areas.

</split>

<split>
## Swamps

1-10. Swamps are forested wetlands. Common to all low jungle areas, swamps have lots of water and poor drainage. Swamps will affect logistical considerations in littoral operations. There are two basic types of swamps-mangrove and palm.

</split>

<split>
## Mangrove Swamps

1-11. Mangrove swamps grow along coastal areas wherever tides influence water flow. The mangrove is a shrub-like tree, which grows 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 meters) high. These trees have tangled root systems, both above and below the water level, which restrict movement to foot or small boats. Observation in mangrove swamps-both on the ground and from the air-is poor. Concealment is excellent.

</split>

<split>
## Palm Swamps

1-12. Palm swamps exist in both salt and freshwater areas. Like movement in the mangrove swamps, movement through palm swamps is mostly restricted to foot
</split>

<split>
(sometimes small boats).

</split>

<split>
Vehicular traffic is nearly impossible except after extensive road construction by engineers.

</split>

<split>
Observation and fields of fire are very limited. Concealment from both air and ground observation is excellent.

</split>

<split>
## Bamboo
</split>

<split>

1-13. Bamboo grows in clumps of varying heights in jungles throughout the tropics. Large stands of bamboo are excellent obstacles for wheeled or tracked vehicles. Troop movement on foot through bamboo is slow, exhausting, and noisy. Troops should bypass bamboo stands if possible.

</split>

<split>
## Cultivated Areas

1-14. Cultivated areas exist throughout the tropics and range from large, well-planned, and wellmanaged farms and plantations to small tracts cultivated by individual farmers. Rice paddies, plantations, and small farms make up the three general types of cultivated areas.

</split>

<split>
## Rice Paddies

1-15. Rice paddies are flat, flooded fields with muddy and soft bottoms. Farmers control the flooding of the fields with a network of dikes and irrigation ditches and fluctuate flooding with seasonal and agricultural cycles. The variable depth of flood waters directly impacts movement with higher flood waters making movement very restricted. However, travel by vehicle is difficult even when fields are dry. Concealment is poor in rice paddies. Cover is limited to the dikes, and then only from ground fire. Observation and fields of fire are excellent. Foot movement is poor when the fields are wet because troops must wade through water and soft mud that is often 20 inches (1/2 meter) deep. When the fields are dry, foot movement becomes easier. Dikes, about 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) tall, are the only obstacles.

</split>

<split>
## Plantations
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-16. Plantations are large farms or estates where tree crops, such as rubber and coconut, are grown. They are usually carefully planned and free of undergrowth (like a well-tended park). Movement through plantations is generally easy. Observation along the rows of trees is generally good. Cover and concealment can be found behind the trees, but troops moving down the cultivated rows are exposed.


</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
## Small Farms
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-17. Small farms exist throughout the tropics. Farmers often create small farms when they clear secondary jungle to cultivate crops. Movement through these areas may be difficult due to fallen trees and scrub brush. Generally, observation and fields of fire have fewer restrictions in cultivated areas than in uncultivated jungles. However, the cultivation removes much of the natural cover and concealment leaving troops more exposed in these areas.


</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
## Weather
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-18. Leaders and troops must understand that the jungle environment is neutral; it affects both friendly and enemy troops the same. Leaders and troops should reference ATP 2-01.3 and MCRP 2-10B.1 (MCRP 2-3A) when preparing estimates on the effects of terrain and weather on operations. 1-19. The degree to which troops are trained to live and fight in harsh environments will determine their unit's success or failure. High heat and humidity are key characteristics of most jungles. Humidity compounds the effects of high heat by making it more difficult for Soldiers/Marines to regulate body temperature through sweat evaporation. 1-20. Despite the obvious impact of heat and humidity, Soldiers/Marines must recognize that they will likely be exposed to cold as well. Temperatures in the jungle may drop 10 degrees or more at night. When coupled with high humidity and often rainy conditions, Soldiers/Marines may become quite uncomfortable if not properly prepared.

</split>

<split>
Temperatures below freezing do not occur, but chilly nights are common. In some jungles during the winter months, the nights are cold enough to require a wool blanket or poncho liner for sleeping. At a minimum, Soldiers/Marines should replace wet clothing worn during the day with dry clothing at night. 1-21. Rainfall in many parts of the tropics is much greater than that in most temperate zones. Tropical downpours are usually followed by clear skies, and, in most places, the rains are predictable at certain times of the day. However, there are areas and times of the year where there is nearly continuous rainfall in many areas of the tropics.

</split>

<split>
## Terrain
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-22. Jungle terrain is varied and ranges from nearly flat savanna to impassable mountain ranges. Units preparing to deploy to specific jungle regions should seek detailed information on terrain prevalent in the expected area of operations due to the terrain variations. 1-23. Jungle terrain can canalize operations due to poor cross-country mobility, limited hardened roads and trails, and limited bridges and hardened crossing points. Some areas affect cross-country mobility with poor trafficability due to soft soils, rocky areas, mountains, dense to impenetrable vegetation, marshy areas, streams, and major rivers. Roads are usually scarce, poorly maintained, and primitive. Limited infrastructure reduces hardened crossing points over or through water features.

</split>

<split>
## Observation And Fields Of Fire
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-24. Observation and fields of fire are generally restricted in jungles. Steep jungle terrain, extensive and dense vegetation, and intermittent and rapidly changing atmospheric conditions restrict direct-fire weapons well short of their maximum range. The minimum engagement range of weapon systems must be considered when emplacing and employing weapons, especially for wire-guided munitions and delayed fused weapons. 1-25. Even though the landscape appears flat when viewed from above; the terrain under the dense vegetative growth can be undulating with relatively deep streams, river beds, and depressions creating significant dead space. Direct fire weapons must be sited to provide mutual support and cover dead space. Troops cover dead space by utilizing indirect fires paired with sensors or observation posts, or aerial fire assets. 1-26.

</split>

<split>
When units cannot establish manned observation posts from dominant terrain, the only means of observation may be from manned aircraft systems, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), or electronic sensor. However, dense vegetation and weather conditions can severely limit these platforms and systems. 1-27. UASs should be used in conjunction with other unmanned and manned reconnaissance and surveillance systems in a jungle environment. Successful UAS employment in a jungle requires adequate planning for dense vegetation and other environmental factors. Depending on the platform and mission, planners and operators may have to consider the environmental factors in four separate locations: landing and recovery site, transit route, satellite relay site, and anticipated target location. (See ATP 3-04.64/ MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/ NTTP 3-55.14/AFTTP 3-2.64 and MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3-42.1] for details on planning for UASs. For UAS characteristics and employment considerations, refer to ATP 3-04.1, ATP 3-04.64/MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/ NTTP 3-55.14/AFTTP 3-2.64, and MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3- 42.1], and all applicable technical manuals.) 1-28. Troops can conduct or enhance observation using electronic devices that utilize discrete bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronically assisted observation includes radar, image intensifiers, and infrared (IR) systems that may be ground based or aerial. 1-29. Radars emit extremely short bursts of electromagnetic radiation, which are then reflected off a target and return as an echo. Several radar modes work in the jungle, including moving target indicator and synthetic aperture radar. Radar cannot positively identify a target, cannot see through buildings or terrain, and is degraded by rain and vegetation. Additionally, radar is an active electromagnetic emitter that can be sensed by threat systems. (See ATP 3-55.6/MCRP 2-10A.4 [MCRP 2-24A]/NTTP 3-55.13/AFTTP 3-2.2 for additional information regarding aerial radar operations.) 1-30. Image intensifiers, such as night vision devices (NVDs), work by amplifying visible light and the IR spectrum closest to the frequencies of visible light to create a digital picture. NVDs are passive unless paired with an illuminator for active use. Passive NVDs can operate effectively in jungle environments when ambient visible light exists. However, cloud cover, fog, inclement weather, and dense overhead vegetation negatively impact passive NVDs. (See TC 3-22.9 for more on using NVDs.) 1-31. IR imaging sensors work by amplifying the mid- and far-wavelengths of the IR band to create a digital picture representing the total IR radiation of an object and its background. IR sensors are generally passive devices. IR sensors work effectively in jungle environments in all lighting. The performance characteristics of an IR sensor determines its capabilities to see through different densities and types of atmospheric obscurants. (See ATP 3-04.64/
MCRP 3-20.6 [MCRP 3-42.1A]/NTTP 3-55.14/ AFTTP 3-2.64, MCRP 3-20.5 [MCWP 3-42.1], and TC 3-22.9 for more information on IR sensors.) IR imaging sensors are effective during all environmental conditions. 1-32. Sensor systems operate in one of two modes:
Active. Active sensors emit energy that reflects from targets and is recaptured by the emitting or other nearby sensor, indicating the presence of a target. Examples of active sensors are searchlights and radar.

</split>

<split>
Passive. Passive sensors do not emit energy;
they collect energy, which may indicate the presence of a target. Examples of passive sensors are the human eye, NVDs, IR imaging devices, acoustic sensors, and photographic devices.

</split>

<split>
1-33. Correction of indirect and aerial fires can be complicated in the jungle environment. Heavy tree cover can cause munitions to detonate in the overhanging branches. Troops can overcome this early detonation by using special fusing.

</split>

<split>
Additionally, troops may fail to observe the impact of rounds due to limited observation ranges requiring adjustment of fires to be conducted using other methods.

</split>

<split>
## Avenues Of Approach
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-34. Roads and trails crisscross many jungle areas, the majority of which are unimproved and not allweather capable. Improved all-weather roads that support wheeled vehicles are rare; complex road systems beyond simple commercial links generally do not exist. For centuries, locals have used simple roads and trails to connect centers of commerce, collection points, and natural resources such as mineral deposits and timber resources. Roads and trails in jungle regions support dismounted movement. Speed of movement varies depending on the weather, ground composition, wet gap crossings, and topographical influences. 1-35. The relatively few improved all-weather routes in many jungle areas will channelize movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles. Logistics units are heavily impacted by this scarcity and channelizing as they require improved routes in order to maintain the line of communications (LOC) for their large, mission- essential vehicles that have limited off-road trafficability. 1-36. Jungle regions use rivers and streams as highways to move large amounts of material any significant distance. These rivers and streams often have heavy overgrowth providing concealment from ground and aerial observation. The threat of fluctuating water levels due to precipitation, or the lack thereof, poses significant danger to Soldiers/ Marines and their equipment as they traverse rivers and streams. Flooding may occur even when it is not raining in the immediate area. Before crossing rivers or streams, units reconnoiter the far side of the linear obstacle for both trafficability and security. Enemy forces in covered and concealed positions can easily engage exposed Soldiers and Marines during gap crossings. 1-37. Normally mangrove and palm swamps prove impassable to all but the lightest equipped forces. Regardless, any force requires detailed reconnaissance to assess trafficability. Many jungles have swamp areas associated with rivers and streams as well as along the sea coast. Old trails or paths may cross the swamp, which are visible from the ground but invisible from aerial observation.

</split>

<split>
Trafficability of swamps directly relates to the depth of the water, which can vary widely based upon precipitation and the time of the year.

</split>

<split>
1-38. Exploration for and production of oil and other natural resources means wells, pipelines, refineries, quarries, and crushing plants may be of strategic importance in the jungle. Pipelines installed 3 feet (1 meter) off the ground inhibit movement. Subsurface pipelines can also create an obstacle. In Southwest Asia, maps generally indicate locations of subsurface pipelines. Often, these pipes are buried at such a shallow depth that heavy vehicles can damage them when traversing them. Furthermore, if a pipeline ruptures, not only is the spill of oil a consideration, but the fumes may be hazardous as well. 1-39. Agriculture in jungle areas typically has large effects on trafficability. The dike systems associated with rice paddies can limit surface mobility and create choke points. Large plantations create areas with great amounts of trafficability for mounted and dismounted forces. Abandoned small farms can create small pockets of secondary jungle which significantly decreases trafficability.

</split>

<split>
## Key Terrain
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-40. *Key terrain* is an identifiable characteristic whose seizure or retention affords a marked advantage to either combatant (ADP 3-90). Key terrain in the jungle can be any man-made feature, water crossing, water way, or high ground. Because there are few man-made features in the jungle, those that do exist can become important, perhaps even key. Bridges over waterways, regardless of size, often become key terrain due to their relative scarcity. The high ground in the jungle can be key terrain, but limited observation and fields of fire may reduce their importance. 1-41. In jungle regions, navigable waterways are extremely likely to be key terrain. They often offer the only way to move large amounts of people, supplies, and equipment significant distances relatively rapidly. The meandering routes and variability of water flows complicates their utilization and security.

</split>

<split>
## Obstacles
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-42. Obstacles abound in jungle regions. Jungle are generally large natural obstacles to wheeled and tracked vehicles as well as dismounted troops. Waterways, thick to impenetrable vegetation, steep slopes, swamps, water saturated soils, and mountains all hinder cross-country movement. 1-43. The few trafficable areas in the jungle are ideal for employing man-made obstacles as the natural terrain denies readily available bypass routes. Buried mines of all types are incredibly effective in jungle regions due the ability of vegetation to hide any evidence of their emplacement.

</split>

<split>
1-44. Rivers and streams can pose a danger to moving units, as they can appear unexpectedly, and vehicles and personnel can fall off the elevated embankment. The embankments of a river of stream may have heavy erosion and collapse under the weight of personnel or vehicles. River and stream embankments are particularly difficult to detect when conducting operations using NVDs, with limited ambient illumination, and thick vegetation.


</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
## Water
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-45. Annual precipitation rates in the jungle are the highest in the world. Many of the major rivers of the world, or their tributaries, are part of the jungle regions. The Amazon River traverses the Amazon Rainforest and is the largest river in the world. The movement and presence of water in jungle is its defining characteristic and has a large impact on military operations.


</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
## Vegetation
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-46. Jungle vegetation usually grows in dense concentrations and often provides concealment from the ground and air. Numerous edible plants and shrubs grow in the jungle that Soldiers/Marines can eat in survival situations. 1-47. Many jungle plants and shrubs have toxic resins that can cause blisters. Milky sap and red beans or berries are indicative of poisonous and dangerous plants. The danger from poisonous plants in the jungle is comparable to the woods of the United States eastern seaboard. Soldiers/Marines can avoid many of the dangers associated with poisonous vegetation by keeping their sleeves down and wearing gloves when practical. (Refer to ATP 3-50.21 for more information on poisonous and edible plants.)


</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
## Wildlife
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-48. Jungles host an impressive array of biodiversity and contain many animal species that can harm troops. Paragraphs 1-49 through 1-62 broadly describe various animal species that pose a threat to Soldiers/Marines. (For more information on the various plants and animals encountered in the jungle, refer to ATP 3-50.21.)

</split>

<split>
## Insects
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-49. Numerous biting and stinging insects inhabit the jungle. Troops with known allergies to insect bites and stings must deploy with epinephrine autoinjectors. Medical providers should have higher than normal on-hand quantities of epinephrine due to the prevalence of biting and stinging insects in the jungle.

</split>

<split>
1-50. Mosquitoes are the most dangerous of the tropical insects. The largest health threat posed by mosquitoes is malaria, but mosquitoes carry numerous other diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. Additionally, mosquitoes can carry heartworm larvae that can infect military working dogs. 1-51. Precautions against malaria and other mosquito borne diseases include-
</split>

<split>
Taking prescribed antimalarial prophylactic medication.

</split>

<split>
Taking prescribed heartworm prophylactic medication (military working dogs).

</split>

<split>
Using insect repellent. Wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing that covers as much of the body as possible.

</split>

<split>
Using nets or screens at every opportunity. Avoiding the worst infested areas when possible.

</split>

<split>
1-52. Mosquitoes are most prevalent early at night and just before dawn. Troops must be especially cautious at these times. Malaria is more common in populated areas than in uninhabited jungle, so troops must also be especially cautious when operating around villages. 1-53. Flies can pose a health hazard to humans; they can carry and spread diseases if not controlled. Certain flies that feed on mammals and humans can cause lesions and infections. Troops can take the following precautions to protect against flies:
</split>

<split>
Use insect repellent. Wear permethrin-impregnated clothing that covers as much of the body as possible.

</split>

<split>
Use nets or screens at every opportunity. Avoid the worst infested areas when possible.

</split>

<split>
1-54. Wasps and bees are common in some jungle regions, but they will rarely attack unless their nests are disturbed. When a nest is disturbed, troops must leave the area and reassemble at the last rally point. In case of stings, Soldiers/Marines seek medical attention. 1-55. Centipedes, spiders, and scorpions that inhabit the jungle can inflict painful stings. These insects prefer dark places. As such, Soldiers/Marines should shake out sleep systems and ensure clothing and boots are free of insects before dressing. Spider bites can be painful and often require medical treatment due to necrotic tissue and secondary infection. Ants can be dangerous to troops that are lying in the prone, sleeping, or injured and unable to move. Wounded troops should be placed in an area free of ants. 1-56. In Southeast Asian jungles, the rice borer moth of the lowlands collects around lights in great numbers during certain seasons. It is a small, plaincolored moth with a pair of tiny black spots on the wings. It should never be brushed off roughly, as the small barbed hairs of its body may be ground into the skin. This causes a sore, much like a burn, that often takes weeks to heal.

</split>

<split>
## Leeches
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-57. Leeches are common in many jungles, particularly throughout most of the Southwest Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Malay Peninsula. They are found in swampy areas, streams, and moist jungle country. They are not venomous, but their bites may become infected if not cared for properly. The small wound that they cause may provide a point of entry for infectious diseases that cause tropical ulcers or "jungle sores." Troops operating in the jungle should watch for leeches on the body and brush them off before they have had time to bite. When they have taken hold, they should not be pulled off forcibly because part of the leech may remain in the skin. Leeches will release themselves if touched with insect repellent, a moist piece of tobacco, the burning end of a cigarette, a coal from a fire, or a few drops of alcohol. 1-58. Straps wrapped around the lower part of the legs ("leech straps") will prevent leeches from crawling up the legs and into the crotch area.

</split>

<split>
Soldiers/Marines securely blouse or tuck their trousers into their boots to hinder leech access.

</split>

<split>
## Snakes
</split>

<split>

</split>

<split>
1-59. While traveling in jungle environments, troops must stay alert to and avoid disturbing snakes. Troops should be particularly watchful when clearing ground. Each jungle region has certain species indigenous to the area. Before deploying, Soldiers/Marines access the electronic DOD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) for the area accessible at <https:// www.fcg.pentagon.mil/>. Section VII, "Travel Information," of the guide identifies diseases caused by local insects. Units need to establish a procedure for treating snakebites. Antivenin is used to treat venomous snakebites. Antivenin is specific to a snake species; there is not a universal snake antivenin. Depending on the availability of antivenin, and the ability to properly store it, snake bite victims may require urgent medical evacuation and treatment at the next higher eche
