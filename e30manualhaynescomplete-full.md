Servicing Specifications


The following maintenance intervals are based on the assumption
that the vehicle owner will be doing the maintenance or service work,
as opposed to having a dealer service department do the work.
Although the time/mileage intervals are loosely based on factory rec-
ommendations, most have been shortened to ensure, for example, that
such items as lubricants and fluids are checked/changed at intervals
that promote maximum engine/driveline service life. Also, subject to
the preference of the individual owner interested in keeping his or her
vehicle in peak condition at all times, and with the vehicle’s ultimate
resale in mind, many of the maintenance procedures may be
performed more often than recommended in the following schedule.
We encourage such owner initiative.
When the vehicle is new, it should be serviced initially by a factory-
authorised dealer service department, to protect the factory warranty.
In many cases, the initial maintenance check is done at no cost to the
owner (check with your dealer service department for more
information).

1 Introduction 
This Chapter is designed to help the home
mechanic maintain his or her vehicle with the
goals of maximum performance, economy,
safety and reliability in mind. Included is a
master maintenance schedule, followed by
procedures dealing specifically with each item
on the schedule. Visual checks, adjustments,
component renewal and other helpful items
are included. Refer to the accompanying
illustrations of the engine compartment and
the underside of the vehicle for the locations
of various components. Servicing the vehicle,
in accordance with the mileage/time
maintenance schedule and the step-by-step
procedures, will result in a planned
maintenance programme that should produce
a long and reliable service life. Keep in mind
that it is a comprehensive plan, so maintaining
some items but not others at specified
intervals, will not produce the same results.
2 Routine maintenance
As you service the vehicle, you will discover
that many of the procedures can - and should
- be grouped together, because of the nature
of the particular procedure you’re performing,
or because of the close proximity of two
otherwise-unrelated components to one
another. For example, if the vehicle is raised
for chassis lubrication, you should inspect the
exhaust, suspension, steering and fuel
systems while you’re under the vehicle. When
the wheels are removed for other work, it
makes good sense to check the brakes, since
the wheels are already removed. Finally, let’s
suppose you have to borrow a torque wrench.
Even if you only need it to tighten the spark
plugs, you might as well check the torque of
as many critical nuts and bolts as time allows. 
The first step in this maintenance
programme is to prepare yourself before the
actual work begins. Read through all the
procedures you’re planning to do, then gather
up all the parts and tools needed. If it looks
like you might run into problems during a
particular job, seek advice from a mechanic or
an experienced do-it-yourselfer.
3 Engine “tune-up” - 
general information 
The term “tune-up” is used in this manual to
represent a combination of individual
operations rather than one specific procedure.
If, from the time the vehicle is new, the
routine maintenance schedule is followed
closely, and frequent checks are made of fluid
levels and high-wear items, as suggested
throughout this manual, the engine will be
kept in relatively good running condition, and
the need for additional work will be minimised. 
More likely than not, however, there will be
times when the engine is running poorly due
to a lack of regular maintenance. This is even
more likely if a used vehicle, which has not
received regular and frequent maintenance
checks, is purchased. In such cases, an
engine tune-up will be needed outside of the
regular maintenance intervals. 
The first step in any tune-up or diagnostic
procedure to help correct a poor-running
engine is a cylinder compression check. A
compression check (see Chapter 2B) will help
determine the condition of internal engine
components, and should be used as a guide
for tune-up and repair procedures. If, for
instance, a compression check indicates
serious internal engine wear, a conventional
tune-up will not improve the performance of
the engine, and would be a waste of time and
money. Because of its importance, the
compression check should be done by
someone with the right equipment, and the
knowledge to use it properly. 
The following procedures are those most
often needed to bring a generally poor-
running engine back into a proper state of
tune. 
Minor tune-up
Check all engine-related fluids (Section 4)
Check all underbonnet hoses (Section 10)
Check and adjust the drivebelts (Sec-
tion 11)
Clean, inspect and test the battery (Sec-
tion 13)
Renew the spark plugs (Section 14)
Inspect the spark plug HT leads, distributor
cap and rotor (Section 15)
Check the air filter (Section 20)
Check the cooling system (Section 22)
Major tune-up
All items listed under minor tune-up, plus . . . 
Check the ignition system (see Chapter 5)
Check the charging system (see Chapter 5)
Check the fuel system (see Chapter 4)
Renew the spark plug HT leads, distributor
cap and rotor (Section 15)

Routine Maintenance
Weekly checks
4 Fluid level checks 1
Note: The following are fluid level checks to
be done on a 250-mile or weekly basis.
Additional fluid level checks can be found in
specific maintenance procedures which
follow. Regardless of intervals, be alert to fluid
leaks under the vehicle, which would indicate
a fault to be corrected immediately.
1 Fluids are an essential part of the
lubrication, cooling, brake and windscreen
washer systems. Because the fluids gradually
become depleted and/or contaminated during
normal operation of the vehicle, they must be
periodically replenished. See “Lubricants and
fluids” at the beginning of this Chapter before
adding fluid to any of the following
components. Note: The vehicle must be on
level ground when any fluid levels are
checked. 
Engine oil
2 Engine oil is checked with a dipstick, which
is located on the side of the engine (refer to
the underbonnet illustrations in this Chapter
for dipstick location). The dipstick extends
through a metal tube down into the sump. 
3 The engine oil should be checked before
the vehicle has been driven, or at least 
15 minutes after the engine has been shut off.
4 Pull the dipstick out of the tube, and wipe
all of the oil away from the end with a clean
rag or paper towel. Insert the clean dipstick all
the way back into the tube, and pull it out
again. Note the oil at the end of the dipstick.
At its highest point, the oil should be between
the two notches or marks (see illustration). 
5 It takes one litre of oil to raise the level from
the lower mark to the upper mark on the
dipstick. Do not allow the level to drop below
the lower mark, or oil starvation may cause
4.4  The oil level should be kept between
the two marks, preferably at or near the
upper one - if it isn’t, add enough oil to
bring the level to the upper mark
If the oil is checked
immediately after driving the
vehicle, some of the oil will
remain in the upper part of
the engine, resulting in an inaccurate
reading on the dipstick.


engine damage. Conversely, overfilling the
engine (adding oil above the upper mark) may
cause oil-fouled spark plugs, oil leaks, or oil
seal failures. 
6 To add oil, remove the filler cap located on
the valve cover (see illustrations). After
adding oil, wait a few minutes to allow the
level to stabilise, then pull the dipstick out and
check the level again. Add more oil if required.
Refit the filler cap, tightening it by hand only. 
7 Checking the oil level is an important
preventive maintenance step. A consistently
low oil level indicates oil leakage through
damaged seals or defective gaskets, or oil
burning (internal leakage past worn rings or
valve guides). The condition of the oil should
also be noted. If the oil looks milky in colour or
has water droplets in it, the cylinder head
gasket may be blown, or the head or block
may be cracked. The engine should be
repaired immediately. Whenever you check
the oil level, slide your thumb and index finger
up the dipstick before wiping off the oil. If you
see small dirt or metal particles clinging to the
dipstick, the oil should be changed (see
Section 6).
Engine coolant
Warning: Do not allow antifreeze
to come in contact with your
skin, or with the vehicle
paintwork. Rinse off spills immediately
with plenty of water. Antifreeze is highly
toxic if ingested. Never leave antifreeze
lying around in an open container, or in
puddles on the floor; children and pets are
attracted by its sweet smell, and may drink
it. Check with local authorities about
disposing of used antifreeze. Local
collection centres may exist, to see that
antifreeze is disposed of safely. 
8 All vehicles covered by this manual are
equipped with a pressurised coolant recovery
system. On most models, a white plastic
expansion tank (or coolant reservoir) located
in the engine compartment is connected by a
hose to the radiator. As the engine heats up
during operation, the expanding coolant fills
the tank. As the engine cools, the coolant is
automatically drawn back into the cooling
system, to maintain the correct level.
9 The coolant level in the reservoir (see
illustrations) should be checked regularly.
Add a 40%/60% mixture of ethylene glycol-
based antifreeze to water (see illustration).
Warning: Do not remove the
expansion tank cap or radiator
cap to check the coolant level,
unless the engine is completely
cold! The level in the reservoir varies with
the temperature of the engine. When the
engine is cold, the coolant level should be
above the LOW mark on the reservoir.
Once the engine has warmed up, the level
should be at or near the FULL mark. If it
isn’t, allow the engine to cool, then remove
the cap from the reservoir. 
10 Drive the vehicle and recheck the coolant
level. If only a small amount of coolant is
required to bring the system up to the proper
level, plain water can be used. However,
repeated additions of water will dilute the
antifreeze. In order to maintain the proper
ratio of antifreeze and water, always top-up
the coolant level with the correct mixture.
11 If the coolant level drops consistently,
there must be a leak in the system. Inspect
the radiator, hoses, filler cap, drain plugs and
water pump (see Section 29). If no leaks are
noted, have the expansion tank cap or
radiator cap pressure-tested by a BMW
dealer.
12 If you have to remove the cap, wait until
the engine has cooled completely, then wrap
a thick cloth around the cap and turn it to the
first stop. If coolant or steam escapes, let the
engine cool down longer, then remove the
cap.
13 Check the condition of the coolant as
well. It should be relatively clear. If it’s brown
or rust-coloured, the system should be
drained, flushed and refilled. Even if the
coolant appears to be normal, the corrosion

the specified intervals.
Brake and clutch fluid
Warning: Brake fluid can harm
your eyes and damage painted
surfaces, so use extreme caution
when handling or pouring it. Do
not use brake fluid that has been standing
open or is more than one year old. Brake
fluid absorbs moisture from the air, which
can cause a dangerous loss of brake
effectiveness. Use only the specified type
of brake fluid. Mixing different types (such
as DOT 3 or 4 and DOT 5) can cause brake
failure. 
14 The brake master cylinder is mounted at
the left rear corner of the engine
compartment. The clutch fluid reservoir
(manual transmission models) is mounted on
the right-hand side.
15 To check the clutch fluid level, observe
the level through the translucent reservoir.
The level should be at or near the step
moulded into the reservoir. If the level is low,
remove the reservoir cap to add the specified
fluid (see illustration).
16 The brake fluid level is checked by looking
through the plastic reservoir mounted on the
master cylinder (see illustration). The fluid
level should be between the MAX and MIN
lines on the reservoir. If the fluid level is low,
first wipe the top of the reservoir and the cap
with a clean rag, to prevent contamination of
the system as the cap is unscrewed. Top-up
with the recommended brake fluid, but do not
overfill. 
17 While the reservoir cap is off, check the
master cylinder reservoir for contamination. If
rust deposits, dirt particles or water droplets
are present, the system should be drained
and refilled.
18 After filling the reservoir to the proper
level, make sure the cap is seated correctly, to
prevent fluid leakage and/or contamination. 
19 The fluid level in the master cylinder will
drop slightly as the disc brake pads wear.
There is no need to top up to compensate for
this fall provided that the level stays above the
MIN line; the level will rise again when new
pads are fitted. A very low level may indicate
worn brake pads. Check for wear (see Sec-
tion 26).
20 If the brake fluid level drops consistently,
check the entire system for leaks immediately.
Examine all brake lines, hoses and
connections, along with the calipers, wheel
cylinders and master cylinder (see Sec-
tion 26). 
21 When checking the fluid level, if you
discover one or both reservoirs empty or
nearly empty, the brake or clutch hydraulic
system should be checked for leaks and bled
(see Chapters 8 and 9).
Windscreen washer fluid
22 Fluid for the windscreen washer system is
stored in a plastic reservoir in the engine
compartment (see illustration).
23 In milder climates, plain water can be
used in the reservoir, but it should be kept no
more than two-thirds full, to allow for
expansion if the water freezes. In colder
climates, use windscreen washer system
antifreeze, available at any car accessory
shop, to lower the freezing point of the fluid.
This comes in concentrated or pre-mixed
form. If you purchase concentrated antifreeze,
mix the antifreeze with water in accordance
with the manufacturer’s directions on the
container.
Caution: Do not use cooling
system antifreeze - it will damage
the vehicle’s paint. 
5 Tyre and tyre pressure
checks 1
1 Periodic inspection of the tyres may save
you the inconvenience of being stranded with
a flat tyre. It can also provide you with vital
information regarding possible problems in
the steering and suspension systems before
major damage occurs. 
2 Tyres are equipped with bands that will
appear when tread depth reaches 1.6 mm, at
which time the tyres can be considered worn
out. This represents the legal minimum tread
depth; most authorities recommend renewing
any tyre on which the tread depth is 2 mm or
less. Tread wear can be monitored with a
simple, inexpensive device known as a tread
depth indicator (see illustration). 
3 Note any abnormal tyre wear (see
illustration overleaf). Tread pattern irregular-
ities such as cupping, flat spots and more
wear on one side than the other are
indications of front end alignment and/or
wheel balance problems. If any of these
conditions are noted, take the vehicle to a tyre
specialist to correct the problem. 
4 Look closely for cuts, punctures and
embedded nails or tacks. Sometimes, after a
nail has embedded itself in the tread, a tyre
will hold air pressure for a short time, or may

leak down very slowly. If a slow puncture
persists, check the valve stem core to make
sure it is tight (see illustration). Examine the
tread for an object that may have embedded
itself in the tyre, or for a previous repair that
may have begun to leak. If a puncture is
suspected, it can be easily verified by
spraying a solution of soapy water onto the
puncture (see illustration). The soapy
solution will bubble if there is a leak. Unless
the puncture is unusually large, a tyre
specialist can usually repair the tyre.
5 Carefully inspect the inner sidewall of each
tyre for evidence of brake fluid leakage. If you
see any, inspect the brakes immediately.
6 Correct air pressure adds miles to the life
span of the tyres, improves fuel economy, and
enhances overall ride quality. A tyre pressure
gauge is essential.
7 Always check the tyre pressures when the
tyres are cold (ie before driving the vehicle).
Checking the pressures when the tyres are
warm, or hot, will result in higher readings,
due to heat expansion. On no account should
air be let out of the tyres in this case, or the
tyres will effectively be under-inflated when
cold.
8 Unscrew the valve cap protruding from the
wheel or hubcap, and push the gauge firmly
onto the valve stem (see illustration). Note
the reading on the gauge, and compare the
figure to the recommended tyre pressures
shown in the Specifications listed at the
beginning of this Chapter. Be sure to refit the
valve cap to keep dirt and moisture out of the
valve stem mechanism. Check all four tyres
and, if necessary, add enough air to bring
them to the recommended pressure. 
9 Don’t forget to keep the spare tyre inflated
to the specified pressure.
1•10
5.8  To extend the life of the tyres, check
the air pressure at least once a week with
an accurate gauge (don’t forget the spare!)
5.4b  If the valve core is tight, raise the
vehicle, and spray a soapy water solution
onto the tread as the tyre is turned slowly -
leaks will cause small bubbles to appear
Tyre tread wear patterns
Shoulder Wear
Underinflation (wear on both sides)
Under-inflation will cause overheating of the
tyre, because the tyre will flex too much, and
the tread will not sit correctly on the road
surface. This will cause a loss of grip and
excessive wear, not to mention the danger of
sudden tyre failure due to heat build-up.
Check and adjust pressures
Incorrect wheel camber (wear on one side)
Repair or renew suspension parts
Hard cornering
Reduce speed!
Centre Wear
Overinflation
Over-inflation will cause rapid wear of the
centre part of the tyre tread, coupled with
reduced grip, harsher ride, and the danger of
shock damage occurring in the tyre casing.
Check and adjust pressures
If you sometimes have to inflate your car’s
tyres to the higher pressures specified for
maximum load or sustained high speed, don’t
forget to reduce the pressures to normal
afterwards.
Uneven  Wear
Front tyres may wear unevenly as a result of
wheel misalignment. Most tyre dealers and
garages can check and adjust the wheel
alignment (or "tracking") for a modest charge.
Incorrect camber or castor
Repair or renew suspension parts
Malfunctioning suspension
Repair or renew suspension parts
Unbalanced wheel

Note: The feathered edge of the tread which
typifies toe wear is best checked by feel.
Weekly Checks
Keep an accurate gauge in
the glove compartment. The
pressure gauges attached to
the nozzles of air hoses at
service stations are often
inaccurate.

6 Engine oil and filter change 1
Warning: Prolonged skin contact
with used engine oil is
hazardous. Use a barrier cream
and wear gloves during this procedure.
Change out of oil-soaked clothing
immediately.
1 Make sure that you have all the necessary
tools before you begin this procedure (see
illustration). You should also have plenty of rags
or newspapers handy for mopping up oil spills
2 Start the engine and allow it to reach
normal operating temperature - oil and sludge
will flow more easily when warm. If new oil, a
filter or tools are needed, use the vehicle to go
and get them, thus warming up the engine oil
at the same time.
3 Park on a level surface, and switch off the
engine when it’s warmed up. Remove the oil
filler cap from the valve cover. 
4 Access to the oil drain plug and filter will be
improved if the vehicle can be lifted on a hoist,
driven onto ramps, or supported by axle
stands.
Warning: DO NOT work under a
vehicle supported only by a
hydraulic or scissors-type jack -
always use axle stands! 
5 If you haven’t changed the oil on this
vehicle before, get under it, and locate the
drain plug and the oil filter. Note that on some
engines, the oil filter is located on the top left-
hand side of the engine. The exhaust
components will be hot as you work, so note
how they are routed to avoid touching them. 
6 Being careful not to touch the hot exhaust
components, position a drain pan under the
plug in the bottom of the engine.
7 Clean the area around the plug, then
remove the plug (see illustration). It’s a good
idea to wear a rubber glove while unscrewing
the plug the final few turns, to avoid being
scalded by hot oil. Hold the drain plug against
the threads as you unscrew it, then pull it
away from the drain hole suddenly. This will
place your arm out of the way of the hot oil, as
well as reducing the chances of dropping the
drain plug into the drain pan. 
8 It may be necessary to move the drain pan
slightly as oil flow slows to a trickle. Inspect
the old oil for the presence of metal particles,
which could give early warning of engine
wear. 
9 After all the oil has drained, wipe off the
drain plug with a clean rag. Any small metal
particles clinging to the plug would
immediately contaminate the new oil.
10 Refit the plug and tighten it securely. Use
a new washer if necessary.
11 Move the drain pan into position under the
oil filter.
Canister-type oil filter
12 Loosen the spin-off type oil filter by
turning it anti-clockwise with a filter spanner.
Any standard filter spanner will work.
13 Sometimes the spin-off type oil filter is
screwed on so tightly that it can’t be easily
loosened. If it is, punch a metal bar or long
screwdriver directly through it, and use it as a
T-bar to turn the filter. Be prepared for oil to
spurt out of the canister as it’s punctured. 
14 Once the filter is loose, use your hands to
unscrew it from the block. Just as the filter is
detached from the block, immediately tilt the
open end up to prevent oil inside the filter
from spilling out. 
15 Using a clean rag, wipe off the mounting
surface on the block. Also, make sure that
none of the old sealing ring remains stuck to
the mounting surface. It can be removed with
a scraper if necessary. 
16 Compare the old filter with the new one,
to make sure they are the same type. Smear
some engine oil on the rubber sealing ring of
the new filter, and screw it into place (see
illustration). Overtightening the filter will
damage the sealing ring, so don’t use a filter
spanner. Most filter manufacturers
recommend tightening the filter by hand only.
Normally, they should be tightened three-
quarters of a turn after the sealing ring
contacts the block, but be sure to follow the
directions on the filter or container. 
6.1  These tools are required when
changing the engine oil and filter
1  Drain pan - It should be fairly shallow in
depth, but wide enough to prevent spills
2  Rubber gloves - When removing the drain
plug and filter, you will get oil on your
hands (the gloves will prevent burns)
3  Socket bar - Sometimes the oil drain plug
is tight, and a long bar is needed to loosen
it. The correct-size ring spanner may work
just as well
4  Socket - To be used with the bar or a
ratchet (must be the correct size to fit the
drain plug - six-point preferred)
5  Filter spanner - This is a metal band-type
spanner, which requires clearance around
the filter to be effective. This tool is not
required on all engines.
6  Filter spanner - This type fits on the bottom
of the filter and can be turned with a ratchet
or breaker bar (different-size spanners are
available for different types of filters) This
tool is not required on all engines.
6.7  Using a ring spanner to remove the oil
drain plug
6.16  Lubricate the oil filter sealing ring
with clean engine oil before refitting the
filter on the engine
Frequent oil changes are the
most important preventive
maintenance procedures that
can be done by the home
mechanic. As engine oil ages, it
becomes diluted and contaminated,
which leads to premature engine wear.


Cartridge-type oil filter
17 Some models are equipped with a
cartridge-type oil filter. Unscrew the bolt,
remove the cover, and lift the filter out (see
18 Compare the new cartridge with the old
one, to make sure they are the same type,
then lower it into the housing.
19 Using a clean rag, wipe off the mounting
surface of the housing and cover. If necessary,
renew the rubber O-ring (see illustration).
Smear some clean oil on the O-ring and refit
the cover and bolt. Tighten the bolt securely.
All models
20 Remove all tools and materials from under
the vehicle, being careful not to spill the oil
from the drain pan, then lower the vehicle.
21 Add new oil to the engine through the oil
filler cap in the valve cover. Use a funnel to
prevent oil from spilling onto the top of the
engine. Pour the specified quantity of fresh oil
into the engine. Wait a few minutes to allow the
oil to drain into the sump, then check the level
on the dipstick (see Section 4 if necessary). If
the oil level is correct, refit the filler cap. 
22 Start the engine and run it for about a
minute. The oil pressure warning light may
take a few seconds to go out while the new
filter fills with oil; don’t rev the engine while
the light is on. While the engine is running,
look under the vehicle, and check for leaks at
the sump drain plug and around the oil filter. If
either one is leaking, stop the engine and
tighten the plug or filter slightly. 
23 Wait a few minutes, then recheck the level
on the dipstick. Add oil as necessary.
24 During the first few days after an oil
change, make it a point to check frequently
for leaks and proper oil level. 
25 The old oil drained from the engine cannot
be re-used in its present state, and should be
discarded. Oil reclamation centres and some
service stations will accept the oil, which can
be recycled. After the oil has cooled, it can be
transferred into a container for transport to a
disposal site.
7 Power steering fluid level
check 1
1 Check the power steering fluid level
periodically to avoid steering system
problems, such as damage to the pump.
Proceed as follows.
Caution: Do not hold the steering
wheel against either stop (full-left
or full-right lock) for more than
five seconds. If you do, the power
steering pump could be damaged.
2 On some models, the power steering fluid
reservoir is located on the left side of the
engine compartment, and has a twist-off cap
with an integral fluid level dipstick (see
illustration). Other models use a hydraulic
power steering and brake servo system which
combines the fluid in one reservoir, located at
the right rear corner of the engine
compartment.
3 Park the vehicle on level ground, and apply
the handbrake.
4 On models with a fluid dipstick, run the
engine until it has reached normal operating
temperature. With the engine at idle, turn the
steering wheel back and forth several times to
get any air out of the steering system. Switch
off the engine, remove the cap by turning it
anti-clockwise, wipe the dipstick clean, and
refit the cap. Remove the cap again, and note
the fluid level. It must be between the two
lines (see illustration). 
5 On hydraulic servo models, pump the brake
pedal about ten times or until the pedal is firm.
Remove the nut, lift the cap off, and make
sure the fluid is within 6.0 mm of the top of the
reservoir.
6 Add small amounts of fluid until the level is
correct (see illustration).

Caution: Do not overfill the
reservoir. If too much fluid is
added, remove the excess with a
clean syringe. Refit the cap.
7 If frequent topping-up is needed, check the
power steering hoses and connections for
leaks and wear (see Section 10).
8 Check the condition and tension of the
drivebelt (see Section 11).
8 Automatic transmission fluid
level check 1
Caution: The use of transmission
fluid other than the type listed in
this Chapter’s Specifications
could result in transmission
malfunctions or failure. 
1 The automatic transmission fluid should be
carefully maintained. Low fluid level can lead
to slipping or loss of drive, while overfilling
can cause foaming and loss of fluid. Either
condition can cause transmission damage. 
2 Since transmission fluid expands as it heats
up, the fluid level should only be checked
when the transmission is warm (at normal
operating temperature). If the vehicle has just
been driven over 20 miles (32 km), the
transmission can be considered warm. You
can also check the fluid level when the
transmission is cold. If the vehicle has not
been driven for over five hours and the fluid is
about room temperature (20°C), the
transmission is cold. However, the fluid level
is normally checked with the transmission
warm, to ensure accurate results. 
Caution: If the vehicle has just
been driven for a long time at
high speed or in city traffic, in hot
weather, or if it has been pulling
a trailer, an accurate fluid level reading
cannot be obtained. Allow the trans-
mission to cool down for about 30 minutes. 
3 Immediately after driving the vehicle, park it
on a level surface, apply the handbrake and
start the engine. While the engine is idling,
depress the brake pedal and move the
selector lever through all the gear ranges,
beginning and ending in Park. 
4 The automatic transmission dipstick tube is
located in the left rear corner of the engine
compartment. 
5 With the engine still idling, pull the dipstick
out of the tube (see illustration), wipe it off
with a clean rag, push it all the way back into
the tube and withdraw it again, then note the
fluid level. 
6 The level should be between the two marks
(see illustration). If the level is low, add the
specified automatic transmission fluid through
the dipstick tube - use a clean funnel,
preferably equipped with a fine mesh filter, to
prevent spills. 
Caution: Be careful not to
introduce dirt into the
transmission when topping up.
7 Add just enough of the recommended fluid
to fill the transmission to the proper level. It
takes about half a litre to raise the level from
the low mark to the high mark when the fluid
is hot, so add the fluid a little at a time, and
keep checking the level until it’s correct.
8 The condition of the fluid should also be
checked along with the level. If the fluid is
black or a dark reddish-brown colour, or if it
smells burned, it should be changed (see
Section 28). If you are in doubt about its
condition, purchase some new fluid, and
compare the two for colour and smell. 
9 Tyre rotation 1
1 The tyres can be rotated at the specified
intervals, or whenever uneven wear is noticed.
However, bear in mind that if rotation
succeeds in making all the tyres wear evenly,
you will eventually have to renew all four at
once. Since the vehicle will be raised and the
wheels removed anyway, check the brakes
also (see Section 26). Note: Even if you don’t
rotate the tyres, at least check the wheel bolt
tightness. 
2 It is recommended that the tyres be rotated
in a specific pattern (see illustration) so that
their direction of rotation remains the same. 
3 Refer to the information in “Jacking and
towing” at the front of this manual for the
proper procedure to follow when raising the
vehicle and changing a tyre.
4 The vehicle must be raised on a hoist or
supported on axle stands to get all four tyres
off the ground. Make sure the vehicle is safely
supported! 
5 After the rotation procedure is finished,
check and adjust the tyre pressures as
necessary, and be sure to check the wheel
bolt tightness. 
10 Underbonnet hose check
and renewal 3
Warning: Renewal of air
conditioning hoses must be left
to a dealer service department or
air conditioning specialist having
the equipment to depressurise the system
safely. Never disconnect air conditioning
hoses or components until the system has
been depressurised. 
General 
1 High temperatures under the bonnet can
cause deterioration of the rubber and plastic
hoses used for various systems. Periodic
inspection should be made for cracks, loose
clamps, material hardening, and leaks.
2 Information specific to the cooling system
can be found in Section 22, while the braking
system is covered in Section 26.
3 Most (but not all) hoses are secured with
clamps. Where clamps are used, check to be
sure they haven’t lost their tension, allowing
the hose to leak. If clamps aren’t used, make
sure the hose has not expanded and/or
hardened where it slips over the fitting,
allowing it to leak. 
Vacuum hoses 
4 It’s quite common for vacuum hoses,
especially those in the emissions system, to
be colour-coded or identified by coloured

bulkhead on the left side of the engine


stripes moulded into them. Various systems
require hoses with different wall thicknesses,
collapse resistance and temperature
resistance. When fitting new hoses, be sure
the new ones are made of the same material.
5 Often the only effective way to check a
hose is to remove it completely from the
vehicle. If more than one hose is removed, be
sure to label the hoses and fittings to ensure
correct refitting. 
6 When checking vacuum hoses, be sure to
include any plastic T-fittings in the check.
Inspect the connections for cracks which
could cause leakage. 
7 A small piece of vacuum hose can be used
as a stethoscope to detect vacuum leaks.
Hold one end of the hose to your ear and
probe around vacuum hoses and fittings,
listening for the “hissing” sound characteristic
of a vacuum leak.
Warning: When probing with the
vacuum hose stethoscope, be
careful not to touch moving
engine components such as the
drivebelt, cooling fan, etc. 
Fuel hoses 
Warning: There are certain
precautions which must be taken
when servicing or inspecting fuel
system components. Work in a
well-ventilated area, and do not allow open
flames (cigarettes, appliance pilot lights,
etc.) or bare light bulbs near the work
area. Mop up any spills immediately, and
do not store fuel-soaked rags where they
could ignite. If you spill any fuel on your
skin, rinse it off immediately with soap and
water. When you perform any kind of work
on the fuel system, wear safety glasses,
and have a fire extinguisher on hand.
8 The fuel hoses are usually under pressure,
so if any fuel hoses are to be disconnected,
be prepared to catch spilled fuel.
Warning: On vehicles equipped
with fuel injection, you must
depressurise the fuel system
before servicing the fuel hoses.
Refer to Chapter 4 for details.
9 Check all rubber fuel hoses for deterioration
and chafing. Check especially for cracks in
areas where the hose bends, and just before
connectors, such as where a hose attaches to
the fuel pump or fuel filter, for example.
10 Only high-quality fuel hose should be
used. Never, under any circumstances, use
unreinforced vacuum hose, clear plastic
tubing or water hose for fuel hoses. 
11 Band-type clamps are commonly used on
fuel hoses. These clamps often lose their
tension over a period of time, and can be
“sprung” during removal. Renew all band-type
clamps with screw clamps whenever a hose is
renewed.
Metal lines 
12 Sections of metal line are often used
between the fuel pump and fuel injection
system. Check carefully to make sure the line
isn’t bent, crimped or cracked. 
13 If a section of metal line must be renewed,
use seamless steel tubing only, since copper
and aluminium tubing do not have the
strength necessary to withstand the vibration
caused by the engine. 
14 Check the metal brake lines where they
enter the master cylinder and brake
proportioning or ABS unit (if used) for cracks
in the lines and loose fittings. Any sign of
brake fluid leakage calls for an immediate
thorough inspection of the braking system. 
Power steering hoses 
15 Check the power steering hoses for leaks,
loose connections and worn clamps. Tighten
loose connections. Worn clamps or leaky
hoses should be renewed. 
11 Drivebelt check, adjustment
and renewal 1
Check
1 The drivebelts, sometimes called V-belts or
simply “fan” belts, are located at the front of
the engine, and play an important role in the
overall operation of the vehicle and its
components. Due to their function and
material make-up, the belts are prone to
failure after a period of time, and should be
inspected and adjusted periodically to prevent
major engine damage.
2 The number of belts used on a particular
vehicle depends on the accessories fitted.
Drivebelts are used to turn the alternator,
power steering pump, water pump, and air
conditioning compressor. Depending on the
pulley arrangement, a single belt may be used
to drive more than one of these components.
3 With the engine switched off, open the
bonnet and locate the various belts at the
front of the engine. Using your fingers (and a
torch, if necessary), move along the belts,
checking for cracks and separation of the belt
plies. Also check for fraying and glazing,
which gives the belt a shiny appearance (see
illustration). Both sides of the belts should be
inspected, which means you will have to twist
each belt to check the underside.
4 The tension of each belt is checked by
pushing firmly with your thumb and seeing
how much the belt moves (deflects). Measure
the deflection with a ruler (see illustration). A
good rule of thumb is that the belt should
deflect 6 mm if the distance from pulley
centre-to-pulley centre is between 180 and
280 mm. The belt should deflect 13 mm if the
distance from pulley centre-to-pulley centre is
between 300 and 400 mm.
Adjustment
5 If it is necessary to adjust the belt tension,
either to make the belt tighter or looser, it is
done by moving a belt-driven accessory on its
bracket. (When the same belt drives more
than one accessory, normally only one
accessory is moved when making
adjustment.)
6 For each component, there will be an
adjusting bolt and a pivot bolt. Both bolts
must be loosened slightly to enable you to
move the component. On some components,
the drivebelt tension can be adjusted by
turning an adjusting bolt after loosening the
lockbolt (see illustration).
7 After the two bolts have been loosened,

the adjuster bolt (arrowed) and turn the

straightedge and ruler
11.3  Here are some of the more common
problems associated with drivebelts
(check the belts very carefully to prevent
an untimely breakdown)


move the component away from the engine to
tighten the belt, or towards the engine to
loosen the belt. Hold the accessory in
position, and check the belt tension. If it is
correct, tighten the two bolts until just tight,
then recheck the tension. If the tension is still
correct, tighten the bolts.
8 It will often be necessary to use some sort
of lever to move the accessory while the belt
is adjusted. If this must be done to gain the
proper leverage, be very careful not to
damage the component being moved, or the
part being prised against.
Renewal
9 To renew a belt, follow the instructions
above for adjustment, but remove the belt
from the pulleys.
10 In some cases, you will have to remove
more than one belt, because of their
arrangement on the front of the engine.
Because of this, and the fact that belts will
tend to fail at the same time, it is wise to
renew all belts together. Mark each belt and
its appropriate pulley groove, so all renewed
belts can be fitted in their proper positions.
11 It is a good idea to take the old belts with
you when buying new ones, in order to make
a direct comparison for length, width and
design.
12 Recheck the tension of new belts after a
few hundred miles.
12 Engine idle speed and CO
level check and adjustment 4
Note: The engine should be at normal
operating temperature, with correct ignition
timing and valve clearances (where
adjustable). The air filter should be in good
condition, and all electrical components
(including the air conditioning, where fitted)
should be switched off.
Carburettor
1 Connect a tachometer and exhaust gas
analyser (CO meter) to the engine.
2 Start the engine and allow it to idle.
3 Check that the idle speed is as given in the
Specifications. Adjustment of the idle speed is
only possible on the 2B4 carburettor. Turn the
carburettor idle speed adjustment screw until
the engine idles at the correct speed (see
illustration).
4 If the idle speed is low on the 2BE
carburettor, and all wiring to the carburettor is
in good condition, it is possible to connect a
resistance into the control circuit. This should
be carried out by your BMW dealer.
5 Check that the CO reading is as given in the
Specifications. If not, turn the carburettor idle
mixture adjustment screw until the mixture is
correct (see illustration).
L-Jetronic
6 Connect a tachometer and CO meter to the
engine. BMW technicians use a special CO
tester with a probe connected into the
exhaust manifold, but the normal type of
tester which locates in the exhaust tailpipe
can be used instead. Note however that on
models with a catalytic converter, meaningful
CO readings will not be obtained at the
tailpipe.
7 Start the engine and allow it to idle.
8 Check that the idle speed is as given in
Specifications. If not, remove the tamperproof
cap from the throttle housing, and turn the idle
adjustment screw until the speed is correct.
9 Check that the CO reading is as given in the
Specifications. The mixture control screw is
located on the airflow meter, and a special
tool (BMW number 13 1 060) may be required
to make the adjustment.
Motronic
10 Connect a tachometer and CO meter to
the engine. BMW technicians use a special
CO tester with a probe connected into the
exhaust manifold, but the normal type of
tester which locates in the exhaust tailpipe
may be used instead. Note however that on
models with a catalytic converter, meaningful
CO readings will not be obtained at the
tailpipe.
11 It is not possible to adjust the idle speed
manually, as the idle air stabiliser valve is
activated by the electronic control unit. If the
idle speed is not within the specified range
with the engine at normal operating
temperature, check for a leak in the air inlet
system, and also check the operation of the
idle air stabiliser valve (see Chapter 4).
12 Check that the CO reading is as given in
the Specifications. If adjustment is required,
prise out the tamperproof plug from the
airflow meter, and turn the adjustment screw
to set the CO content (on some models, an
Allen key will be required). Fit a new
tamperproof plug on completion (see
illustrations).

13 Battery check, maintenance
and charging 2
Check and maintenance
Warning: Certain precautions
must be followed when checking
Hydrogen gas, which is highly
flammable, is always present in the battery
cells, so keep lighted tobacco and all other
flames and sparks away from it. The
electrolyte inside the battery is actually
dilute sulphuric acid, which will cause
injury if splashed on your skin or in your
eyes. It will also ruin clothes and painted
surfaces. When disconnecting the battery
cables, always detach the negative cable
first, and connect it last!
1 Battery maintenance is an important
procedure, which will help ensure that you are
not stranded because of a dead battery.
Several tools are required for this procedure
(see illustration).
2 Before servicing the battery, always switch
off the engine and all accessories, and
disconnect the cable from the negative
terminal of the battery.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code before
disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
3 A low-maintenance battery is standard
equipment. The cell caps can be removed and
distilled water can be added, if necessary.
Later models may be fitted with a
“maintenance-free” battery, which is sealed.
4 Remove the caps and check the electrolyte
level in each of the battery cells. It must be
above the plates. There’s usually a split-ring
indicator in each cell to indicate the correct
level. If the level is low, add distilled water
only, then refit the cell caps.
Caution: Overfilling the cells may
cause electrolyte to spill over
during periods of heavy charging,
causing corrosion and damage to
nearby components.
5 If the positive terminal and cable clamp on
your vehicle’s battery is equipped with a
rubber protector, make sure that it’s not torn
or damaged. It should completely cover the
terminal.
6 The external condition of the battery should
be checked periodically. Look for damage
such as a cracked case.
7 Check the tightness of the battery cable
clamps to ensure good electrical connections.
Check the entire length of each cable, looking
for cracked or abraded insulation and frayed
conductors.
8 If corrosion (visible as white, fluffy deposits)
is evident, remove the cables from the
terminals, clean them with a battery brush,
and reconnect them (see illustrations).
Corrosion can be kept to a minimum by fitting
specially treated washers available at car
accessory shops, or by applying a layer of
petroleum jelly or suitable grease to the
Every 12 000 miles or 12 months, whichever comes first
1•16
13.8d  When cleaning the cable clamps, all
corrosion must be removed (the inside of
the clamp is tapered to match the taper on
the post, so don’t remove too much
material)
13.8c  Regardless of the type of tool used
on the battery posts, a clean, shiny surface
should be the result
13.1  Tools and materials required for
battery maintenance
1  Face shield/safety goggles - When
removing corrosion with a brush, the acidic
particles can easily fly up into your eyes
2  Baking soda - A solution of baking soda and
water can be used to neutralise corrosion
3  Petroleum jelly - A layer of this on the
battery posts will help prevent corrosion
4  Battery post/cable cleaner - This wire-
brush cleaning tool will remove all traces of
corrosion from the battery posts and cable
clamps
5  Treated felt washers - Placing one of
these on each post, directly under the
cable clamps, will help prevent corrosion
6  Puller - Sometimes the cable clamps are
very difficult to pull off the posts, even after
the nut/bolt has been completely loosened.
This tool pulls the clamp straight up and off
the post without damage
7  Battery post/cable cleaner - Here is
another cleaning tool which is a slightly
different version of No 4 above, but it does
the same thing
8  Rubber gloves - Another safety item to
consider when servicing the battery;
remember that’s acid inside the battery!
13.8b  Removing a cable from the battery

battery pliers are required for this
procedure, if corrosion has caused

9 Make sure that the battery carrier is in good
condition, and that the hold-down clamp bolt
is tight. If the battery is removed (see Chap-
ter 5 for the removal and refitting procedure),
make sure that no parts remain in the bottom
of the carrier when it’s refitted. When refitting
the hold-down clamp, don’t overtighten the
bolt.
10 Corrosion on the carrier, battery case and
surrounding areas can be removed with a
solution of water and baking soda. Apply the
mixture with a small brush, let it work, then
rinse it off with plenty of clean water.
11 Any metal parts of the vehicle damaged
by corrosion should be coated with a zinc-
based primer, then painted.
12 Additional information on the battery and
jump starting can be found in Chapter 5 and
the front of this manual.
Charging
Note: The manufacturer recommends the
battery be removed from the vehicle for
charging, because the gas which escapes
during this procedure can damage the paint or
interior, depending on the location of the
battery. Fast charging with the battery cables
connected can result in damage to the
electrical system.
13 Remove all of the cell caps (if applicable),
and cover the holes with a clean cloth to
prevent spattering electrolyte. Disconnect the
battery negative cable, and connect the
battery charger leads to the battery posts
(positive to positive, negative to negative),
then plug in the charger. Make sure it is set at
12 volts if it has a selector switch.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Note: If,
after connecting the battery, the wrong
language appears on the instrument panel
display, refer to page 0-7 for the language
resetting procedure.
14 If you’re using a charger with a rate higher
than two amps, check the battery regularly
during charging to make sure it doesn’t
overheat. If you’re using a trickle charger, you
can safely let the battery charge overnight
after you’ve checked it regularly for the first
couple of hours. Where a maintenance-free
battery is fitted, special precautions may be
necessary when charging it (for example, the
charge rate is normally very low). There may
be a warning label on the battery, but if not,
consult a BMW dealer or auto-electrician.
15 If the battery has removable cell caps,
measure the specific gravity with a
hydrometer every hour during the last few
hours of the charging cycle. Hydrometers are
available inexpensively from car accessory
shops - follow the instructions that come with
the hydrometer. Consider the battery charged
when there’s no change in the specific gravity
reading for two hours, and the electrolyte in
the cells is gassing (bubbling) freely. The
specific gravity reading from each cell should
be very close to the others. If not, the battery
probably has a bad cell(s), and a new one
should be fitted.
16 Some maintenance-free (sealed) batteries
have built-in hydrometers on the top,
indicating the state of charge by the colour
displayed in the hydrometer window.
Normally, a bright-coloured hydrometer
indicates a full charge, and a dark hydrometer
indicates the battery still needs charging.
Check the battery manufacturer’s instructions
to be sure you know what the colours mean.
17 If the battery is sealed and has no built-in
hydrometer, you can connect a digital
voltmeter across the battery terminals to
check the charge. A fully-charged battery
should read 12.6 volts or higher.
18 Further information on the battery and
jump starting can be found in Chapter 5 and
at the front of this manual.
14 Spark plug check and
renewal 1
1 Before beginning, obtain the necessary
tools, which will include a spark plug socket
and a set of feeler blades. Special spark plug
gap gauges can be obtained from certain
spark plug manufacturers (see illustration).
2 The best procedure to follow when
renewing the spark plugs is to purchase the
new spark plugs beforehand, adjust them to
the proper gap, and then renew each plug one
at a time. When buying the new spark plugs, it
is important to obtain the correct plugs for
your specific engine. This information can be
found in the Specifications section in the front
of this Chapter.
3 With the new spark plugs at hand, allow the
engine to cool completely before attempting
plug removal. During this time, each of the
new spark plugs can be inspected for defects
and the gaps can be checked.
4 The gap is checked by inserting the proper
thickness gauge between the electrodes at the
tip of the plug (see illustration). The gap
between the electrodes should be the same as
that given in the Specifications. The wire
should just touch each of the electrodes. If the
gap is incorrect, use the notched adjuster to
bend the curved side of the electrode slightly
until the proper gap is achieved (see
illustration). Note: When adjusting the gap of a
new plug, bend only the base of the earth
electrode, do not touch the tip. If the earth
electrode is not exactly over the centre
electrode, use the notched adjuster to align the
two. Check for cracks in the porcelain insulator,
indicating the spark plug should not be used.
1•17
14.4b  To change the gap, bend the earth
electrode only, as indicated by the arrows,
and be very careful not to crack or chip the
porcelain insulator surrounding the centre
electrode
14.4a  Spark plug manufacturers
recommend using a wire-type gauge when
checking the gap - if the wire does not
slide between the electrodes with a slight
drag, adjustment is required
14.1  Tools required for changing spark
plugs
1  Spark plug socket - This will have special
padding inside to protect the spark plug’s
porcelain insulator
2  Torque wrench - Although not mandatory,
using this tool is the best way to ensure the
plugs are tightened properly
3  Ratchet - Standard hand tool to fit the
spark plug socket
4  Extension - Depending on model and
accessories, you may need special
extensions and universal joints to reach one
or more of the plugs
5  Spark plug gap gauge - This gauge for
checking the gap comes in a variety of
styles. Make sure the gap for your engine is
included. Feeler blades may be used


5 With the engine cool, remove the HT lead
from one spark plug. Do this by grabbing the
connector at the end of the wire, not the lead
necessary to use a twisting motion while the
connector and HT lead are pulled free.
6 If compressed air is available, use it to blow
any dirt or foreign material away from the
spark plug area. A common bicycle pump will
also work. The idea here is to eliminate the
possibility of debris falling into the cylinder as
the spark plug is removed.
7 Place the spark plug socket over the plug,
and remove it from the engine by turning it
anti-clockwise (see illustration).
8 Compare the spark plug with those shown
in the accompanying photos to get an
indication of the overall running condition of
the engine.
9 Apply a little copper-based anti-seize
compound to the threads of the new spark
plug. Locate the plug into the head, screwing
it in with your fingers until it no longer turns,
then tighten it with the socket. If available, use
a torque wrench to tighten the plug to ensure
that it is seated correctly. The correct torque
figure is included in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
10 Before pushing the HT lead onto the end of
the plug, inspect it as outlined in Section 15.
11 Attach the HT lead to the new spark plug,
again using a twisting motion on the
connector until it is firmly seated on the spark
plug.
12 Follow the above procedure for the
remaining spark plugs, renewing them one at
a time to prevent mixing up the spark plug HT
leads.
15 Spark plug HT leads,
distributor cap and rotor -
check and renewal 
1
1 The spark plug HT leads should be checked
at the recommended intervals, and whenever
new spark plugs are fitted in the engine.
2 Begin this procedure by making a visual
check of the spark plug HT leads while the
engine is running. In a darkened garage (make
sure there is ventilation) start the engine and
observe each HT lead. Be careful not to come
into contact with any moving engine parts. If
there is a break in the wire, you will see arcing
or a small spark at the damaged area. If arcing
is noticed, make a note to obtain new HT
leads, then allow the engine to cool.
3 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
4 The HT leads should be inspected one at a
time to prevent mixing up the firing order,
which is essential for proper engine operation.
5 Disconnect the HT lead from the spark
plug. Do not pull on the lead itself, only on the
connector.
6 Inspect inside the connector for corrosion,
which will look like a white crusty powder.
Push the HT lead and connector back onto
the end of the spark plug. It should be a tight
fit on the plug end. If it is not, remove the lead
and use pliers to carefully crimp the metal
terminal inside the connector until it fits
securely on the end of the spark plug.
7 Using a clean rag, wipe the entire length of
the HT lead to remove any built-up dirt and
grease. Once the lead is clean, check for
burns, cracks and other damage. Do not bend
the lead excessively, since the conductor
might break.
8 Disconnect the HT lead from the distributor.
Again, pull only on the connector. Check for
corrosion and a tight fit in the same manner as
the spark plug end. Renew the HT lead in the
distributor if necessary.
9 Check the remaining spark plug HT leads,
making sure they are securely fastened at the
distributor and spark plug when the check is
complete.
10 If new spark plug HT leads are required,
purchase a set for your specific engine model.
Lead sets are available pre-cut, with the
connectors already fitted. Remove and renew
the HT leads one at a time, to avoid mix-ups
in the firing order.
11 Loosen the screws or detach the clips and
remove the distributor cap (see illustration).
Remove the screws (if applicable) and pull the
rotor off the shaft (see illustration). Check the
distributor cap and rotor for wear. Look for
cracks, carbon tracks and worn, burned or
loose contacts (see illustrations). Renew the
cap and rotor if defects are found. It is
common practice to fit a new cap and rotor
whenever new spark plug HT leads are fitted.
When fitting a new cap, remove the HT leads
from the old cap one at a time, and attach

15.11b  Use an Allen key to remove the
screws, then lift the rotor off the shaft

Every 12 000 miles
Where there might be difficulty in
inserting the spark plugs into the spark
plug holes, or the possibility of cross-
threading them into the head, a short
piece of rubber or plastic tubing can be
fitted over the end of the spark plug.
The flexible tubing will act as a universal
joint to help align the plug with the plug
hole, and should the plug begin to
cross-thread, the hose will slip on the
spark plug, preventing thread damage.


them to the new cap in the exact same
location - do not simultaneously remove all
the HT leads, or firing order mix-ups may
occur.
lubricant level check 1
1 The transmission has a filler/level plug
which must be removed to check the lubricant
level. If the vehicle is raised to gain access to
the plug, be sure to support it safely - do not
crawl under a vehicle which is supported only
by a jack! Note: The vehicle should be level to
give an accurate lubricant check.
2 Remove the plug from the side of the
transmission (see illustration) and use your
little finger to reach inside the plug from the
housing and feel the lubricant level. It should
be at or very near the bottom of the plug hole.
3 If it isn’t, add the recommended lubricant
through the plug hole with a syringe or
squeeze-bottle, until it just starts to run out of
the hole. Refer to “Lubricants and fluids” at
the beginning of this Chapter for the correct
lubricant type. The manual transmissions on
some later or high-performance models are
filled with automatic transmission fluid (ATF).
Such transmissions normally carry a sticker to
this effect near the filler/level plug. Refer to a
BMW dealer if still in doubt.
4 Refit the plug and tighten securely. Check
for leaks after the first few miles of driving.
5 If regular topping-up is required, this can
only be due to a leak which should be found
and repaired before it becomes serious.
17 Differential lubricant level
check 1
1 The differential has a filler/level plug which
must be removed to check the lubricant level.
If the vehicle is raised to gain access to the
plug, be sure to support it safely - do not
crawl under the vehicle when it’s supported
only by the jack! Note: The vehicle should be
level to give an accurate lubricant check.
2 Remove the filler/level plug from the
differential (see illustration). Use an Allen key
to unscrew the plug.
3 Use your little finger as a dipstick to make
sure the lubricant level is up to the bottom of
the plug hole. If not, use a syringe or squeeze-
bottle to add the recommended lubricant until
it just starts to run out of the hole.
4 Refit the plug and tighten it securely.
5 If regular topping-up is required, this can
only be due to a leak which should be found
and repaired before it becomes serious.
18 Valve clearances -
check and adjustment 3
Note: This procedure does not apply to the
M40 engine, which has automatic adjusters.
1 The valve clearances can be checked with
the engine hot or cold, but note that different
values are specified, depending on engine
temperature. If it is wished to check/adjust the
valve clearances with the engine hot, if
necessary start and run the engine until it
reaches normal operating temperature, then
shut it off.
Caution: If the clearances are checked
with the engine hot, extra care
must be taken to avoid burns.
2 Remove the valve cover
from the engine (see Chapter 2A).
3 Turn the engine as necessary until No 1
piston (front) is at Top Dead Centre (TDC) on
the compression stroke (see Chapter 2A).
4 Check the valve clearances for No 1
cylinder. The valve clearances can be found in
the Specifications Section at the beginning of
this Chapter.
5 The clearance is measured by inserting the
specified size feeler gauge between the end
of the valve stem and the rocker arm adjusting
eccentric. You should feel a slight amount of
1•19
15.11d  The rotor arm should be checked
for wear and corrosion as indicated here 
(if in doubt about its condition, buy a new
one)
15.11c  Shown here are some of the
common defects to look for when
inspecting the distributor cap (if in doubt
about its condition, fit a new one)
18.6  The valve clearance is adjusted by
turning the eccentric with a wire hook -
once the specified clearance is obtained,
tighten the locknut with a spanner, then
remove the feeler gauge
17.2  Remove the differential filler/level
plug with an Allen key, and make sure the
lubricant is level with the bottom of the
16.2  Use a large Allen key to remove the
filler/level plug (arrowed) and check the
lubricant level with your little finger. It
should be level with the bottom of the hole
- if it’s low, add lubricant


drag when the feeler gauge is moved back
6 If the gap is too large or too small, loosen
the locknut, insert a hook made from large-
diameter metal wire, and rotate the eccentric
to obtain the correct gap (see illustration).
7 Once the gap has been set, hold the
eccentric in position with the hook, and
retighten the locknut securely. Recheck the
clearance - sometimes it’ll change slightly
when the locknut is tightened. If so, re-adjust
until it’s correct.
8 On the M10 engine, the valves are adjusted
in the firing order, which is 1-3-4-2. After
adjusting No 1 cylinder valves, rotate the
crankshaft half a turn (180º), then check and
adjust the valves on No 3 cylinder. Repeat the
procedure on the remaining cylinders.
9 On M20 and M30 engines, the valves are
adjusted following the firing order, which is 
1-5-3-6-2-4. After adjusting No 1 cylinder
valves, rotate the crankshaft a third of a turn
(120º), then check and adjust the valves on No
5 cylinder. Repeat the procedure for the
remaining cylinders.
10 Refit the valve cover (use a new gasket)
and tighten the mounting nuts evenly and
securely.
11 Start the engine and check for oil leakage
between the valve cover and the cylinder
head.
19 Throttle linkage -
check and lubrication 1
1 The throttle linkage should be checked and
lubricated periodically to ensure its proper
operation.
2 Check the linkage to make sure it isn’t
binding.
3 Inspect the linkage joints for looseness, and
the connections for corrosion and damage,
renewing parts as necessary (see
illustration).
4 Lubricate the connections with spray
lubricant or lithium-based grease.
20 Air filter renewal 1
Carburettor engines
1 Release the spring clips, then unscrew the
centre nut and lift off the cover.
2 Remove the air filter element, and wipe

4 Loosen the clamp on the air intake duct,
and detach the duct (see illustration).
5 Release the air cleaner cover retaining clips
(see illustration).
6 Rotate the cover up, lift it off and lift the
element out, noting which way round it is
fitted (see illustrations).
7 Wipe the inside of the air cleaner housing
with a clean cloth, then fit the new element. If
the element is marked TOP, be sure the
marked side faces up.
8 Refit the cover and secure the clips.
9 Connect the air duct and tighten the clamp
screw.

Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. Work in a well-
ventilated area. If you spill any fuel on your
skin, rinse it off immediately with soap and
water. When you perform any kind of work
on the fuel system, wear safety glasses,
and have a fire extinguisher on hand. Mop
up spills immediately, but do not store
fuel-soaked rags where they could ignite.
1 If you smell fuel while driving or after the
vehicle has been sitting in the sun, inspect the
fuel system immediately.
2 Remove the fuel filler cap and inspect it for
damage and corrosion. The gasket should
have an unbroken sealing imprint. If the
gasket is damaged or corroded, fit a new cap.
3 Inspect the fuel feed and return lines for
cracks. Make sure that the connections
between the fuel lines and the carburettor or
fuel injection system, and between the fuel
lines and the in-line fuel filter, are tight.
Warning: On fuel injection
models, the fuel system must be
depressurised before servicing
fuel system components, as
outlined in Chapter 4.

4 Since some components of the fuel system
- the fuel tank and some of the fuel feed and
return lines, for example - are underneath the
vehicle, they can be inspected more easily
with the vehicle raised on a hoist. If that’s not
possible, raise the vehicle and support it on
axle stands or ramps.
5 With the vehicle raised and safely
supported, inspect the fuel tank and filler neck
for punctures, cracks or other damage. The
connection between the filler neck and the
tank is particularly critical. Sometimes a
rubber filler neck will leak because of loose
clamps or deteriorated rubber. Inspect all fuel
tank mounting brackets and straps, to be sure
the tank is securely attached to the vehicle.
Warning: Do not, under any
circumstances, try to repair a fuel
tank (except rubber
components). A welding torch or
any naked flame can easily cause fuel
vapours inside the tank to explode.
6 Carefully check all flexible hoses and metal
lines leading away from the fuel tank. Check
for loose connections, deteriorated hoses,
crimped lines, and other damage. Repair or
renew damaged sections as necessary (see
Chapter 4).
22 Cooling system check 1
1 Many major engine failures can be
attributed to cooling system problems. If the
vehicle has automatic transmission, the
engine cooling system also plays an important
role in prolonging transmission life, because it
cools the transmission fluid.
2 The engine should be cold for the cooling
system check, so perform the following
procedure before the vehicle is driven for the
day, or after it has been switched off for at
least three hours.
3 Remove the radiator cap, doing so slowly
and taking adequate precautions against
scalding if the engine is at all warm. Clean the
cap thoroughly, inside and out, with clean
water. Also clean the filler neck on the
radiator. The presence of rust or corrosion in
the filler neck means the coolant should be
changed (see Section 29). The coolant inside
the radiator should be relatively clean and
clear. If it’s rust-coloured, drain the system
and refill with new coolant.
4 Carefully check the radiator hoses and the
smaller-diameter heater hoses. Inspect each
coolant hose along its entire length, renewing
any hose which is cracked, swollen or
deteriorated (see illustration). Cracks will
show up better if the hose is squeezed. Pay
close attention to hose clamps that secure the
hoses to cooling system components. Hose
clamps can pinch and puncture hoses,
resulting in coolant leaks.
5 Make sure all hose connections are tight. A
leak in the cooling system will usually show up
as white or rust-coloured deposits on the area
adjoining the leak. If wire-type clamps are
used on the hoses, it may be a good idea to
replace them with screw-type clamps.
6 Clean the front of the radiator (and, where
applicable, the air conditioning condenser)
with compressed air if available, or a soft
brush. Remove all flies, leaves, etc,
embedded in the radiator fins. Be extremely
careful not to damage the cooling fins or to
cut your fingers on them.
7 If the coolant level has been dropping
consistently and no leaks are detected, have
the radiator cap and cooling system pressure-
tested.
23 Exhaust system check 1
1 The engine should be cold for this check,
so perform the following procedure before the
vehicle is driven for the day, or after it has
been switched off for at least three hours.
Check the complete exhaust system from the
engine to the end of the tailpipe. Ideally, the
inspection should be done with the vehicle on
a hoist, to give unrestricted access. If a hoist
isn’t available, raise the vehicle and support it
securely on axle stands or ramps.
2 Check the exhaust pipes and connections
for evidence of leaks, severe corrosion, and
damage. Make sure that all brackets and
mountings are in good condition, and that
they are tight (see illustration).
3 At the same time, inspect the underside of
the body for holes, corrosion, open seams,
etc. which may allow exhaust gases to enter
the passenger compartment. Seal all body
openings with suitable sealant.
4 Rattles and other noises can often be
traced to the exhaust system, especially the
mountings and heat shields. Try to move the
pipes, silencers (and, where applicable, the
catalytic converter). If the components can
come in contact with the body or suspension
parts, re-hang the exhaust system with new
mountings.
5 The running condition of the engine may be
checked by inspecting inside the end of the
tailpipe. The exhaust deposits here are an
indication of the engine’s state of tune. If the
pipe is black and sooty, the engine may be
running too rich, indicating the need for a
thorough fuel system inspection.
24 Steering and suspension
check 1
Note: The steering linkage and suspension
components should be checked periodically.
Worn or damaged suspension and steering
linkage components can result in excessive
and abnormal tyre wear, poor ride quality and
vehicle handling, and reduced fuel economy.
For detailed illustrations of the steering and
suspension components, refer to Chapter 10.
Strut/shock absorber check
1 Park the vehicle on level ground, turn the
engine off and apply the handbrake. Check
the tyre pressures.
2 Push down at one corner of the vehicle,
then release it while noting the movement of
the body. It should stop moving and come to
rest in a level position with one or two
bounces.
3 If the vehicle continues to move up and
down, or if it fails to return to its original
position, a worn or weak strut or shock
absorber is probably the reason.
4 Repeat the above check at each of the
three remaining corners of the vehicle.
5 Raise the vehicle and support it on axle
stands.
6 Check the struts/shock absorbers for
evidence of fluid leakage. A light film of fluid is

22.4  Hoses, like drivebelts, have a habit of
failing at the worst possible time - to
prevent the inconvenience of a blown

mountings for cracks


no cause for concern. Make sure that any fluid
noted is from the struts/shocks, and not from
any other source. If leakage is noted, renew
the struts or shock absorbers in axle pairs (or
as a full set).
7 Check the struts/shock absorbers to be
sure that they are securely mounted and
undamaged. Check the upper mountings for
damage and wear. If damage or wear is
noted, renew the struts or shock absorbers.
8 If the struts or shock absorbers must be
renewed, refer to Chapter 10 for the
procedure. Always renew both units on the
same axle, or the safety of the vehicle may be
compromised. If possible, renew all four as a
set.
Steering and suspension check
9 Inspect the steering system components
for damage and distortion. Look for leaks and
damaged seals, boots and fittings.
10 Clean the lower end of the steering
knuckle. Have an assistant grasp the lower
edge of the tyre and move the wheel in and
out, while you look for movement at the
steering knuckle-to-axle arm balljoints.
Inspect the balljoint boots for tears (see
illustration). If there is any movement, or the
boots are torn or leaking, the balljoint(s) must
be renewed.
11 Grasp each front tyre at the front and rear
edges, push in at the front, pull out at the rear
and feel for play in the steering linkage. If any
free play is noted, check the steering gear
mountings and the track rod balljoints for
looseness. If the steering gear mountings are
loose, tighten them. If the track rods are
loose, the balljoints may be worn (check to
make sure the nuts are tight). Additional
steering and suspension system information
can be found in Chapter 10.
25 Driveshaft gaiter check 1
1 The driveshaft gaiters are very important
because they prevent dirt, water and foreign
material from entering and damaging the
constant velocity (CV) joints. External oil and
grease contamination can cause the gaiter
material to deteriorate prematurely, so it’s a
good idea to wash the gaiters with soap and
water.
2 Inspect the gaiters for tears and cracks, as
well as for loose clamps (see illustration). If
there is any evidence of cracks or leaking
lubricant, the gaiter must be renewed (see
Chapter 8).
26 Brake system check 2
Warning: Dust produced by lining
wear and deposited on brake
components may contain
asbestos, which is hazardous to
your health. Do not blow it out with
compressed air, and don’t inhale it! Do not
use petroleum-based solvents to remove
the dust. Brake system cleaner or
methylated spirit should be used to flush
the dust into a drain pan. After the brake
components are wiped with a damp rag,
dispose of the contaminated rag(s) and the
drain pan contents into a covered and
labelled container. Try to use asbestos-
free new parts whenever possible.
Note: In addition to the specified intervals, the
brake system should be inspected each time
the wheels are removed or a malfunction is
indicated. Because of the obvious safety con-
siderations, the following brake system checks
are some of the most important maintenance
procedures you can perform on your vehicle.
Symptoms of brake system
problems
1 The disc brakes have built-in electrical wear
indicators which cause a warning light on the
dash to come on when they’re worn to the
renewal point. When the light comes on,
renew the pads immediately, or expensive
damage to the brake discs could result.
2 Any of the following symptoms could
indicate a potential brake system defect:
a) Vehicle pulls to one side when the brake
pedal is depressed
b) Brakes make squealing or dragging noises
when applied
c) Brake pedal travel excessive
d) Brake pedal pulsates (normal if ABS is
working)
e) Brake fluid leaks (usually on the inner side
of the tyre or wheel)
3 If any of these conditions are noted, inspect
the brake system immediately.
Brake lines and hoses
Note: Steel brake pipes are used throughout
the brake system, with the exception of
flexible, reinforced hoses at the front wheels
and as connectors at the rear axle. Periodic
inspection of all these lines is very important.
4 Park the vehicle on level ground, and
switch off the engine. Remove the wheel
covers. Loosen, but do not remove, the bolts
on all four wheels.
5 Raise the vehicle and support it securely on
axle stands.
6 Remove the wheels (see “Jacking and
towing” at the front of this book, or refer to
your owner’s handbook, if necessary).
7 Check all brake lines and hoses for cracks,
chafing of the outer cover, leaks, blisters, and
distortion. Check the brake hoses at front and
rear of the vehicle for softening, cracks,
bulging, or wear from rubbing on other
components. Check all threaded fittings for
leaks, and make sure the brake hose
mounting bolts and clips are secure.
8 If leaks or damage are discovered, they
must be repaired immediately. Refer to
Chapter 9 for detailed brake system repair
procedures.
Disc brakes
9 If it hasn’t already been done, raise the
vehicle and support it securely on axle stands.
Remove the front wheels.
10 The disc brake calipers, containing the
pads, are now visible. Each caliper has an
outer and an inner pad - all pads should be
checked.
11 Note the pad thickness by looking
through the inspection hole in the caliper (see
illustration). If the lining material is 2.0 mm
thick or less, or if it is tapered from end to
end, the pads should be renewed (see
Chapter 9). Keep in mind that the lining
1•22
26.11  Look through the caliper inspection
window to inspect the brake pads - the
pad lining which rubs against the disc can
also be inspected by looking through each
25.2  Gently probe the driveshaft boots to

material is bonded to a metal plate or shoe -
the metal portion is not included in this
measurement. Always renew the pads on
both sides of the vehicle (in axle sets), even if
only one pad of the four is worn, or uneven
braking may result.
12 Remove the calipers without
disconnecting the brake hoses (see Chap-
ter 9).
13 Check the condition of the brake disc.
Look for score marks, deep scratches and
overheated areas (they will appear blue or
discoloured). If damage or wear is noted, the
disc can be removed and resurfaced by an
engineering workshop; otherwise, it will have
to be renewed. In either case, both discs
should be involved, even if only one is worn.
Refer to Chapter 9 for more detailed
inspection and repair procedures. 
Drum brakes
14 Refer to Chapter 9 and remove the rear
brake drums.
15 Note the thickness of the lining material
on the rear brake shoes, and look for signs of
contamination by brake fluid or grease (see
illustration). If the material is within 2.0 mm of
the recessed rivets or metal shoes, renew the
brake shoes. The shoes should also be
renewed if they are cracked, glazed (shiny
lining surfaces), or contaminated with brake
fluid or grease. See Chapter 9 for the renewal
procedure.
16 Check the shoe return and hold-down
springs and the adjusting mechanism. Make
sure all these components are fitted correctly,
and are in good condition. Deteriorated or
distorted springs, if not renewed, could allow
the linings to drag and wear prematurely.
17 Check the wheel cylinders for leakage by
carefully peeling back the rubber boots. Slight
moisture behind the boots is acceptable. If
brake fluid is noted behind the boots or if it
runs out of the wheel cylinder, the wheel
cylinders must be overhauled or renewed (see
Chapter 9).
18 Check the drums for cracks, score marks,
deep scratches and high spots, which will
appear as small discoloured areas. If
imperfections cannot be removed with emery
cloth, both drums must be resurfaced by a
specialist (see Chapter 9 for more detailed
information).
19 Refer to Chapter 9 and fit the brake
drums.
20 Refit the wheels, but don’t lower the
vehicle yet.
Handbrake
21 The easiest, and perhaps most obvious,
method of checking the handbrake is to park
the vehicle on a steep hill with the handbrake
applied and the transmission in Neutral (stay
in the vehicle while performing this check). If
the handbrake doesn’t prevent the vehicle
from rolling, refer to Chapter 9 and adjust it.
27 Wiper blades -
check and renewal 1
1 Road film can build up on the wiper blades
and affect their efficiency, so they should be
washed regularly with a mild detergent
solution.
Check
2 The wiper and blade assembly should be
inspected periodically. If inspection reveals
hardened or cracked rubber, renew the wiper
blades. If inspection reveals nothing unusual,
wet the windscreen, turn the wipers on, allow
them to cycle several times, then switch them
off. An uneven wiper pattern across the glass,
or streaks over clean glass, indicate that the
blades should be renewed.
3 The operation of the wiper mechanism can
loosen the retaining nuts, so they should be
checked and tightened, as necessary, at the
same time the wiper blades are checked (see
Chapter 12 for further information regarding
the wiper mechanism).
Wiper blade renewal
4 Pull the wiper/blade assembly away from
the glass.
5 Press the retaining tab in, and slide the
blade assembly down the wiper arm (see
illustration).
6 If you wish to renew the blade rubbers
separately, detach the end of the rubber from
the wiper blade frame, then slide the rubber
out of the frame (see illustration).
7 Compare the new rubber with the old for
length, design, etc.
8 Slide the new rubber into place, and insert
the end in the wiper blade frame to lock it in
place.
9 Refit the blade assembly on the arm, then
wet the glass and check for proper operation.

28 Automatic transmission fluid
and filter change 1
1 At the specified intervals, the transmission
fluid should be drained and renewed. Since
the fluid will remain hot long after driving,
perform this procedure only after the engine
has cooled down completely.
2 Before beginning work, purchase the
specified transmission fluid (see “Lubricants
and fluids” at the beginning of this Chapter)
and a new filter.
3 Other tools necessary for this job include axle
stands or ramps to support the vehicle in a
raised position, a drain pan capable of holding at
least 4.5 litres, and newspapers and clean rags.
4 Raise the vehicle and support it securely.
5 Loosen the dipstick tube collar, then detach
the dipstick tube and let the fluid drain (see
illustrations).
6 Remove the transmission sump mounting
bolts and brackets (see illustration).


7 Detach the sump from the transmission and
lower it, being careful not to spill the
8 Carefully clean the sump-to-transmission
contact surface.
9 Pour the fluid from the sump into a suitable
container, then clean the sump with solvent
and dry it with compressed air. Be sure to
clean any metal filings from the magnet, if
applicable.
10 Remove the filter from inside the
transmission (see illustrations).
11 Fit the O-ring and a new filter, being sure
to tighten the bolts securely.
12 Make sure that the sump gasket contact
surfaces are clean, then fit the new gasket.
Offer the sump up to the transmission, and
refit the brackets and bolts. Working around
the sump, tighten each bolt a little at a time
until the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations is reached. Don’t overtighten the
bolts! Connect the dipstick tube, and tighten
the collar securely.
13 Lower the vehicle, and add the specified
amount of fluid through the filler tube (see
Section 8).
14 With the transmission in Park and the
handbrake applied, run the engine at fast idle,
but don’t race it.
15 Move the gear selector through each
position, and back to Park. Check the fluid
level.
16 Check under the vehicle for leaks after the
first few trips.
29 Cooling system - draining,
flushing and refilling 1
Warning: Do not allow antifreeze
to come in contact with your skin,
or with the painted surfaces of the
vehicle. Rinse off spills
immediately with plenty of water. Antifreeze
is highly toxic if ingested. Never leave
antifreeze lying around in an open container
or in puddles on the floor; children and pets
are attracted by its sweet smell, and may
drink it. Check with local authorities about
disposing of used antifreeze. Local
collection centres may exist to see that
antifreeze is disposed of safely.
1 Periodically, the cooling system should be
drained, flushed and refilled. This will restore
the effectiveness of the antifreeze mixture and
prevent formation of rust and corrosion, which
can impair the performance of the cooling
system and cause engine damage. When the
cooling system is serviced, all hoses and the
radiator cap should be checked and renewed
if necessary.
Draining
2 If the vehicle has just been driven, wait
several hours to allow the engine to cool down
before beginning this procedure.
3 Once the engine is completely cool, remove
the expansion tank cap or radiator cap. If the
cap must be removed while the engine is still
warm, unscrew it slowly, and take adequate
precautions to avoid scalding.
4 Move a large container under the radiator to
catch the coolant. Where a drain plug is fitted,
unscrew it (a pair of pliers or screwdriver may
be required to turn it, depending on the
model) (see illustration). Where there is no
drain plug, it will be necessary to disconnect
the bottom hose from the radiator.
5 While the coolant is draining, check the
condition of the radiator hoses, heater hoses
and clamps (see Section 21 if necessary).
6 Renew any damaged clamps or hoses (see
Chapter 3 for detailed renewal procedures).
1•24

Flushing
7 Once the system is completely drained,
flush the radiator with fresh water from a
garden hose until the water runs clear at the
drain or bottom hose. If the radiator is
severely corroded, damaged or leaking, it
should be removed (see Chapter 3) and taken
to a radiator repair specialist.
8 Flushing in this way will remove sediments
from the radiator, but will not remove rust and
scale from the engine and cooling tube
surfaces. These deposits can be removed by
using a chemical cleaner. Follow the
procedure outlined in the  cleaner
manufacturer’s instructions. Remove the
cylinder block drain plug before flushing the
engine.
9 On models so equipped, remove the
overflow hose from the coolant recovery
reservoir. Drain the reservoir and flush it with
clean water, then reconnect the hose.
Refilling
10 Tighten the radiator drain plug, or
reconnect the radiator bottom hose. Refit and
tighten the cylinder block drain plug.
Four-cylinder engines
11 Slowly add new coolant (a 40%/60%
mixture of antifreeze to water) to the radiator
until it is full. Add coolant to the reservoir up
to the lower mark.
12 Leave the radiator cap off, and run the
engine in a well-ventilated area until the
thermostat opens (coolant will begin flowing
through the radiator, and the upper radiator
hose will become hot).
13 Turn the engine off, and let it cool. Add
more coolant mixture to bring the coolant
level back up to the lip on the radiator filler
neck. On the M40 engine, unscrew the bleed
screw from the top of the radiator, and add
coolant until it comes out of the bleed screw
hole. Refit and tighten the bleed screw.
14 Squeeze the upper radiator hose to expel
air, then add more coolant mixture if
necessary. Refit the radiator cap.
15 Start the engine, allow it to reach normal
operating temperature, and check for leaks.
Six-cylinder engines
16 Loosen the bleed screw in the thermostat
housing (see illustration)
17 Fill the radiator with a 40%/60% solution
of antifreeze and water until it comes out of
the bleed screw opening. Tighten the bleed
screw.
18 Refit the radiator cap, and run the engine
until the thermostat opens (the upper radiator
hose will become hot). Slowly loosen the
bleed screw until no bubbles emerge, then
tighten the screw.
19 Repeat the procedure until the air is bled
from the system.
30 Fuel filter renewal 1
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, rinse it off immediately
with soap and water. When you perform
any kind of work on the fuel system, wear
safety glasses, and have a fire
extinguisher on hand.
1 On fuel injection engines, depressurise the
fuel system (see Chapter 4).
2 The fuel filter is located in the engine
compartment on the bulkhead, or under the
vehicle adjacent to the fuel tank.
3 Because on some models the filter is
located adjacent to the starter motor, fuel
could leak onto the electrical connections. For
safety reasons, therefore, disconnect the
battery negative cable before beginning work.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
4 Place a pan or rags under the fuel filter to
catch any spilled fuel. If suitable hose clamps
are available, clamp the inlet and outlet hoses.
5 Detach the hoses and remove the bracket
screws/nuts, then remove the filter and where
applicable the bracket assembly (see
illustration).
6 Detach the filter from the bracket.
7 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure
the arrow on the filter points in the direction of
fuel flow.
31 Manual transmission
lubricant change 1
1 Tools necessary for this job include axle
stands to support the vehicle in a raised
position, an Allen key to remove the drain
plug, a drain pan, newspapers and clean rags.
The correct amount of the specified lubricant
should also be available (see “Lubricants and
fluids” at the start of this Chapter).
2 The lubricant should be drained when it is
hot (ie immediately after the vehicle has been
driven); this will remove any contaminants
better than if the lubricant were cold. Because

wear rubber gloves.
3 Raise the vehicle and place it on axle
stands. Make sure it is safely supported, and
as level as possible.
4 Move the necessary equipment under the
vehicle, being careful not to touch any of the
hot exhaust components.
5 Place the drain pan under the transmission,
and remove the filler/level plug from the side
of the transmission. Loosen the drain plug
(see illustration).
6 Carefully remove the drain plug. Be careful
not to burn yourself on the lubricant.
7 Allow the lubricant to drain completely.
Clean the drain plug thoroughly, then refit and
tighten it securely.
8 Refer to Section 16 and fill the transmission
with new lubricant, then refit the filler/level
plug, tightening it securely.
9 Lower the vehicle. Check for leaks at the
drain plug after the first few miles of driving.
32 Differential lubricant change 1
1 Drive the vehicle for several miles to warm
up the differential lubricant, then raise the
vehicle and support it securely on axle stands.
2 Move a drain pan, rags, newspapers and an
Allen key under the vehicle. Since the
lubricant will be hot, wear rubber gloves to
prevent burns.
3 Remove the filler/level plug from the
differential; this is the upper of the two plugs.
4 With the drain pan under the differential,
loosen the drain plug; this is the lower of the
two plugs (see illustration).
5 Carefully unscrew the drain plug until you
can remove it from the case.
6 Allow all the oil to drain into the pan, then
refit the drain plug and tighten it securely.
7 Refer to Section 17 and fill the differential
with lubricant.
8 Refit the filler/level plug and tighten it
securely.
9 Lower the vehicle. Check for leaks at the
drain plug after the first few miles of driving.
33 Evaporative emissions
control (EVAP) system check 1
1 The function of the evaporative emissions
control system is to draw fuel vapours from
the tank and fuel system, store them in a
charcoal canister, and then burn them during
normal engine operation. This system is
normally only fitted to those vehicles
equipped with a catalytic converter.
2 The most common symptom of a fault in
the evaporative emissions system is a strong
fuel odour in the engine compartment. If a fuel
odour is detected, inspect the charcoal
canister and system hoses for cracks. The
canister is located in the front corner of the
engine compartment on most models (see
illustration).
3 Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on
the evaporative emissions system.
34 Service indicator light
resetting 4
Service indicator lights
1 All models covered in this manual are
equipped with various service indicator lights
on the facia, which automatically go on when
the mileage interval is reached. These lights
can only be turned off by using a special tool
which plugs into the service connector
located in the engine compartment.
2 Although the service light resetting tool can
be obtained from a dealer, reasonably-priced
alternatives may also be available from
aftermarket sources. When obtaining a tool, it
is important to know the vehicle year and
model, and whether the service connector has
15 or 20 pins (see illustrations). Once the
proper tool is obtained, it is a simple matter to
plug it into the service connector and,
following the tool manufacturer’s instructions,
reset the service lights. Note: The brake
warning light will not automatically reset if the
sensor on the brake pad (or its wiring) is
damaged because it is worn through: it must
be repaired first.
3 The service lights are controlled by the

1 General information
The chassis electrical system of this vehicle
is of 12-volt, negative earth type. Power for
the lights and all electrical accessories is
supplied by a lead/acid-type battery, which is
charged by the alternator.
This Chapter covers repair and service
procedures for various chassis (non-engine
related) electrical components. For
information regarding the engine electrical
system components (battery, alternator,
distributor and starter motor), see Chapter 5.
Warning: To prevent electrical
short-circuits, fires and injury,
always disconnect the battery
negative terminal before
checking, repairing or renewing electrical
components.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery, Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
2 Electrical system fault
finding - general information 2
A typical electrical circuit consists of an
electrical component, any switches, relays,
motors, fuses, fusible links or circuit breakers,
etc related to that component, and the wiring
and connectors that link the components to
both the battery and the chassis. To help you
pinpoint an electrical circuit problem, wiring
diagrams are included at the end of this book.
Before tackling any troublesome electrical
circuit, first study the appropriate wiring
diagrams to get a complete understanding of
what makes up that individual circuit.
Troublespots, for instance, can often be
isolated by noting if other components related
to that circuit are routed through the same
fuse and earth connections.
Electrical problems usually stem from
simple causes such as loose or corroded
connectors, a blown fuse, a melted fusible
link, or a bad relay. Inspect all fuses, wires
and connectors in a problem circuit first.
The basic tools needed include a circuit
tester, a high-impedance digital voltmeter, a
continuity tester and a jumper wire with an in-
line circuit breaker for bypassing electrical
components. Before attempting to locate or
define a problem with electrical test
instruments, use the wiring diagrams to
decide where to make the necessary
connections.
Voltage checks
Perform a voltage check first when a circuit
is not functioning properly. Connect one lead
of a circuit tester to either the negative battery
terminal or a known good earth.
Connect the other lead to a connector in
the circuit being tested, preferably nearest to
the battery or fuse. If the bulb of the tester
lights up, voltage is present, which means that
the part of the circuit between the connector
and the battery is problem-free. Continue
checking the rest of the circuit in the same
fashion.
When you reach a point at which no voltage
is present, the problem lies between that point
and the last test point with voltage. Most of
the time, problems can be traced to a loose
connection. Note: Keep in mind that some
circuits receive voltage only when the ignition
key is turned to a certain position.
Electrical fault diagnosis is simple if you
keep in mind that all electrical circuits are
basically electricity running from the battery,
through the wires, switches, relays, fuses and
fusible links to each electrical component
(light bulb, motor, etc) and then to earth, from
where it is passed back to the battery. Any
electrical problem is an interruption in the flow
of electricity to and from the battery.


Finding a short-circuit
One method of finding a short-circuit is to
remove the fuse and connect a test light or
voltmeter in its place. There should be no
voltage present in the circuit. Move the
electrical connectors from side-to-side while
watching the test light. If the bulb goes on,
there is a short to earth somewhere in that
area, probably where the insulation has been
rubbed through. The same test can be
performed on each component in a circuit,
even a switch.
Earth check
Perform a earth check to see whether a
component is properly earthed (passing
current back via the vehicle body). Disconnect
the battery, and connect one lead of a self-
powered test light (often known as a
continuity tester) to a known good earth.
Connect the other lead to the wire or earth
connection being tested. The bulb should
light, indicating a good earth connection. If
not, dismantle the connection, and clean all
relevant parts thoroughly. When re-making
the connection, use serrated (shakeproof)
washers if possible, and tighten all bolts, etc,
securely.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery, Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Continuity check
A continuity check determines if there are
any breaks in a circuit - if it is conducting
electricity properly. With the circuit off (no
power in the circuit), a self-powered continuity
tester can be used to check the circuit.
Connect the test leads to both ends of the
circuit, and if the test light comes on, the
circuit is passing current properly. If the light
doesn’t come on, there is a break somewhere
in the circuit. The same procedure can be
used to test a switch, by connecting the
continuity tester to the power-in and power-
out sides of the switch. With the switch turned
on, the test light should come on.
Finding an open-circuit
When diagnosing for possible open-
circuits, it is often difficult to locate them by
sight, because oxidation or terminal
misalignment are hidden by the connectors.
Intermittent problems are often caused by
oxidised or loose connections. Merely
wiggling an electrical connector may correct
the open-circuit condition, albeit temporarily.
Dismantle the connector, and spray with a
water-dispersant aerosol. On simpler
connectors, it may be possible to carefully
bend the connector pins inside, to improve
the metal-to-metal contact - don’t damage
the connector in the process, however.
3 Fuses - general information 1
The electrical circuits of the vehicle are
protected by a combination of fuses and
circuit breakers. The fusebox is located in the
left corner of the engine compartment (see
illustration). On some later models, it is
located under the rear seat cushion.
Each of the fuses is designed to protect a
specific circuit, and on some models, the
various circuits are identified on the fuse
panel itself.
Miniaturised fuses are employed in the
fuseboxes. These compact fuses, with blade
terminal design, allow fingertip removal and
renewal. If an electrical component fails,
always check the fuse first. A blown fuse is
easily identified through the clear plastic
body. Visually inspect the element for
evidence of damage. If a continuity check is
called for, the blade terminal tips are exposed
in the fuse body.
Be sure to renew blown fuses with the
correct type. Fuses of different ratings are
physically interchangeable, but only fuses of
the proper rating should be used. Replacing a
fuse with one of a higher or lower value than
specified is not recommended. Each electrical
circuit needs a specific amount of protection.
The amperage value of each fuse is moulded
into the fuse body.
If the new fuse immediately fails, don’t
renew it again until the cause of the problem
is isolated and corrected. In most cases, the
cause will be a short-circuit in the wiring
caused by a broken or deteriorated wire.
4 Relays - general information 1
Several electrical accessories in the vehicle
use relays to transmit the electrical signal to
the component. If the relay is defective, that
component will not operate properly. Relays
are electrically-operated switches, which are
often used in circuits drawing high levels of
current, or where more complex switching
arrangements are required.
The various relays are grouped together for
convenience in several locations under the
dash and in the engine compartment (see
accompanying illustration and illus-
tration 3.1).
If a faulty relay is suspected, it can be
removed and tested by a dealer or qualified
automotive electrician. No overhaul is
possible. Like fuses, defective relays must be
replaced with the correct type; some relays
look identical, but perform very different
functions.

Warning: Some later models are
equipped with an airbag or
Supplemental Restraint System
(SRS). To avoid possible damage
to this system, the manufacturer
recommends that, on airbag-equipped
models, the following procedure should be
left to a dealer service department, or
other specialist, because of the special
tools and techniques required. There is a
risk of injury if the airbag is accidentally
triggered.
1 The direction indicator/hazard flasher unit is
a small canister- or box-shaped unit located
in the wiring harness on or near the steering
column. Access is gained by removing the
steering column shrouds (see illustration).
2 When the flasher unit is functioning
properly, a regular clicking noise can be heard
from it when the indicators or hazard flashers
are switched on. If the direction indicators fail
on one side or the other, and the flasher unit
does not make its characteristic clicking
sound, a faulty direction indicator bulb is
indicated.
3 If both direction indicators fail to blink, the
problem may be due to a blown fuse, a faulty
flasher unit, a broken switch or a loose or open
connection. If a quick check of the fusebox

11 Service Indicator (SI) board -
general information
All models that have service indicator lights
are equipped with a Service Indicator (SI)
board located in the instrument cluster. This
board turns the lights on at the proper mileage
intervals. The lights can only be turned off
using a special tool which plugs into the
engine check connector (see Chapter 1). The

SI board is a self-contained computer which
includes a chip and batteries.
The rechargeable SI board nickel cadmium
(nicad) batteries maintain power to the
computer memory in the event of a power
drop (such as during starting) or complete
power loss (such as a dead or disconnected
battery) (see illustration). This assures power
so the computer can continue to keep track of
mileage and turn the lights on at the proper
interval.
The batteries have a life of approximately
six years, at which time they must be replaced
with new ones. Also, since they are recharged
by the engine charging system, they can run
down prematurely if power is cut off for some
reason (such as a blown fuse, a fault in the
wiring, or extended storage of the vehicle).
Excessive heat or cold can also shorten
battery life, with heat the greatest enemy.
Extreme heat can cause the batteries to
actually split open, allowing acid to drip into
the instrument cluster.
Several instruments controlled by the SI
board can be affected by low or discharged
batteries. Symptoms of low or dead SI board
batteries can include inconsistent tachometer
and temperature gauge readings, background
radio noise, and the inability to turn the
service lights off with the special tool.
Although only complete SI boards are
available from the manufacturer, batteries are
available separately from aftermarket sources.
While it is possible for the home mechanic to
renew the batteries, they are soldered to the
board, so unless you are skilled at this and
have the proper tools, this job should be left
to an experienced electronics technician.
Considerable savings can be realised by
removing the instrument cluster (see 
Section 10) and taking it to an electronics
specialist.
Caution: the instrument cluster
and components are very
susceptible to damage from
static electricity. Make sure you
are earthed and have discharged any
static electricity (by touching an object
such as a metal water pipe) before
touching the cluster components.

13 Headlights - adjustment 2
Note: The headlights must be aimed correctly.
If adjusted incorrectly, they could momentarily
blind the driver of an oncoming vehicle and
cause a serious accident, or seriously reduce
your ability to see the road. The headlights
should be checked for proper aim every 
12 months (as is done during the MOT test),
and any time a new headlight is fitted or front-
end body work is performed. It should be
emphasised that the following procedure will
only provide a temporary setting until the
headlights can be adjusted by a properly-
equipped garage.
1 Each headlight has two adjusting screws,
one controlling up-and-down movement and
one controlling left-and-right movement (see
illustration). It may be necessary to remove
the grille (see Chapter 11) for access to these
screws.
2 There are several methods of adjusting the
headlights. The simplest method requires a
blank wall (or garage door) 25 feet in front of
the vehicle, and a level floor.
3 Position masking tape vertically on the wall,
to mark the vehicle centreline and the
centreline of both headlights. Note: It may be
easier to position the tape on the wall with the
vehicle parked only a few inches away, and
then move the vehicle back the required
distance when all marks have been made.
4 Make a horizontal line on the wall to mark
the centreline of all headlights.
5 Move the vehicle back so that it is 25 feet
away from the marked wall (keep the front end
of the vehicle square to the wall). Adjustment
should be made with the vehicle sitting level,
the fuel tank half-full, and with no unusually
heavy loads in the vehicle.
6 Switch on the dipped beam. The bright
spots on the wall should be two inches below
the horizontal line, and two inches to the left
of the headlight vertical lines. Adjustment is
made by turning the adjusting screw to raise
or lower the beam. The other adjusting screw
should be used in the same manner to move
the beam left or right.
7 With main beam on, the bright spots on the
wall should be exactly on the vertical lines,
and just below the horizontal line. Note: It may
not be possible to position the headlight aim
exactly for both main and dipped beams. If a
compromise must be made, keep in mind that
the dipped beam is most used, and will have
the greatest effect on driver safety.
8 Have the headlights adjusted by a dealer
service department or qualified garage at the
earliest opportunity.

Repair
6 Repair the break in the line using a repair kit
recommended specifically for this purpose,
such as BMW repair kit No. 81 22 9 (or
equivalent). Included in this kit is plastic
conductive epoxy. The following paragraphs
give general instructions for this type of repair;
follow the instructions supplied with the repair
kit if they are different.
7 Prior to repairing a break, switch off the
circuit and allow it to cool down for a few
minutes.
8 Lightly buff the element area with fine steel
wool, then clean it thoroughly.
9 Use masking tape to mask off the area of
repair, leaving a slit to which the epoxy can be
applied.
10 Mix the epoxy thoroughly, according to
the instructions on the package.
11 Apply the epoxy material to the slit in the
masking tape, overlapping the undamaged
area about 20 mm on each end.
12 Allow the repair to cure for 24 hours
before removing the tape and using the
heated rear window.
18 Supplemental Restraint
System (SRS) - general
information
Later models are equipped with a
Supplemental Restraint System (SRS),
incorporating an airbag. This system is
designed to protect the driver from serious
injury in the event of a head-on or frontal
collision. It consists of an airbag module in the
centre of the steering wheel, two crash
sensors mounted on the front inner wing
panels, and a crash safety switch located
inside the passenger compartment.
The airbag module contains a housing
incorporating the airbag and the inflator units.
The inflator assembly is mounted on the back
of the housing over a hole through which gas
is expelled, inflating the bag almost instanta-
neously when an electrical signal is sent from
the system. This signal is carried by a wire
which is specially wound with several turns,
so the signal will be transmitted regardless of
the steering wheel position.
The SRS system has three sensors: two at
the front, mounted on the inner wing panels
(see illustration), and a safety switch located
inside the passenger compartment. The crash
sensors are basically pressure-sensitive
switches, which complete an electrical circuit
during an impact of sufficient force. The
electrical signal from the crash sensors is sent
to a third sensor, which then completes the
circuit and inflates the airbag.
The module containing the safety switch
monitors the system operation. It checks the
system every time the vehicle is started,
causing the AIRBAG warning light to come on,
then go out if the system is operating
correctly. If there is a fault in the system, the
light will stay on. If the AIRBAG warning light
does stay on, or if it comes on while driving,
take the vehicle to your dealer immediately.
19 Cruise control system -
description and check 1
The cruise control system maintains vehicle
speed using a vacuum-actuated servo motor
located in the engine compartment, which is
connected to the throttle linkage by a cable.
The system consists of the servo motor,
clutch switch, brake switch, control switches,
a relay, and associated vacuum hoses.
Because of the complexity of the cruise
control system, repair should be left to a
dealer service department. However, it is
possible for the home mechanic to make
simple checks of the wiring and vacuum
connections for minor faults which can be
easily repaired. These include:
a) Inspect the cruise control actuating switches
for broken wires and loose connections.
b) Check the cruise control fuse.
c) The cruise control system is operated by
vacuum, so it’s critical that all vacuum
switches, hoses and connections are
secure. Check the hoses in the engine
compartment for loose connections,
cracks, or obvious vacuum leaks.
20 Central locking system -
description and check 2
The central door locking system operates
the door lock actuators mounted in each
door. The system consists of the switches,
actuators and associated wiring. Diagnosis is
limited to simple checks of the wiring
connections and actuators for minor faults
which can be easily repaired. These include:
a) Check the system fuse and/or circuit
breaker (where applicable).
b) Check the switch wires for damage and
loose connections. Check the switches
for continuity.
c) Remove the door trim panel(s), and check
the actuator wiring connections to see if
they’re loose or damaged. Inspect the
actuator rods to make sure they aren’t

The electric window system operates the
electric motors mounted in the doors which
lower and raise the windows. The system
consists of the control switches, the motors,
window mechanisms (regulators) and
associated wiring. Removal of the motors and
regulators is described in Chapter 11.
Diagnosis is usually limited to simple
checks of the wiring connections and motors
for minor faults which can be easily repaired.
These include:
a) Check the electric window switches for
broken wires and loose connections.
b) Check the electric window fuse/and or
circuit breaker (where applicable).
c) Remove the door trim panel(s) and check
the electric window motor wires to see if
they’re loose or damaged. Inspect the
window mechanisms for damage which
could cause binding.
22 Wiring diagrams - 
general information
Since it isn’t possible to include all wiring
diagrams for every model year covered by this
manual, the following diagrams are those that
are typical and most commonly needed.
Prior to checking any circuit, check the
fuses and circuit breakers to make sure they’re
in good condition. Make sure the battery is
fully charged and check the cable connections
(see Chapter 1). Make sure all connectors are
clean, with no broken or loose terminals.

These models feature an all-steel welded
construction, where the floorpan and body
components are welded together and
attached to separate front and rear subframe
assemblies. Certain components are
particularly vulnerable to accident damage,
and can be unbolted and repaired or renewed.
Among these parts are the body mouldings,
bumpers, bonnet, doors, tailgate, and all
glass.
Only general body maintenance procedures
and body panel repair procedures within the
scope of the do-it-yourselfer are included in
this Chapter.
2 Bodywork and underframe -
maintenance 1
The general condition of a vehicle’s
bodywork is the one thing that significantly
affects its value. Maintenance is easy, but
needs to be regular. Neglect, particularly after
minor damage, can lead quickly to further
deterioration and costly repair bills. It is
important also to keep watch on those parts
of the vehicle not immediately visible, for
instance the underside, inside all the wheel
arches, and the lower part of the engine
compartment.
The basic maintenance routine for the
bodywork is washing - preferably with a lot of
water, from a hose. This will remove all the
loose solids which may have stuck to the
vehicle. It is important to flush these off in
such a way as to prevent grit from scratching
the finish. The wheel arches and underframe
need washing in the same way, to remove any
accumulated mud, which will retain moisture
and tend to encourage rust. Paradoxically
enough, the best time to clean the underframe
and wheel arches is in wet weather, when the
mud is thoroughly wet and soft. In very wet
weather, the underframe is usually cleaned of
large accumulations automatically, and this is
a good time for inspection.
Periodically, except on vehicles with a wax-
based underbody protective coating, it is a
good idea to have the whole of the
underframe of the vehicle steam-cleaned,
engine compartment included, so that a
thorough inspection can be carried out to see
what minor repairs and renovations are
necessary. Steam-cleaning is available at
many garages, and is necessary for the
removal of the accumulation of oily grime,
which sometimes is allowed to become thick
in certain areas. If steam-cleaning facilities are
not available, there are some excellent grease
solvents available which can be brush-
applied; the dirt can then be simply hosed off.
Note that these methods should not be used
on vehicles with wax-based underbody
protective coating, or the coating will be
removed. Such vehicles should be inspected
annually, preferably just prior to Winter, when
the underbody should be washed down, and
any damage to the wax coating repaired.
Ideally, a completely fresh coat should be
applied. It would also be worth considering
the use of such wax-based protection for
injection into door panels, sills, box sections,
etc, as an additional safeguard against rust
damage, where such protection is not
provided by the vehicle manufacturer.
After washing paintwork, wipe off with a
chamois leather to give an unspotted clear
finish. A coat of clear protective wax polish will
give added protection against chemical
pollutants in the air. If the paintwork sheen has
dulled or oxidised, use a cleaner/polisher
combination to restore the brilliance of the
shine. This requires a little effort, but such
dulling is usually caused because regular
washing has been neglected. Care needs to be
taken with metallic paintwork, as special non-
abrasive cleaner/polisher is required to avoid
damage to the finish. Always check that the
door and ventilator opening drain holes and
pipes are completely clear, so that water can
be drained out. Brightwork should be treated in
the same way as paintwork. Windscreens and
windows can be kept clear of the smeary film
which often appears, by the use of proprietary
glass cleaner. Never use any form of wax or
other body or chromium polish on glass.

3 Interior trim - maintenance 1
Interior trim panels can be kept clean by
wiping with a damp cloth. If they do become
stained (which can be more apparent on light-
coloured trim), use a little liquid detergent and
a soft nail brush to scour the grime out of the
grain of the material. Do not forget to keep the
headlining clean in the same way. After
cleaning, application of a high-quality rubber
and vinyl protector will help prevent oxidation
and cracks. The protector can also be applied
to weatherstrips, vacuum lines and rubber
hoses, which often fail as a result of chemical
degradation, and to the tyres.
4 Upholstery and carpets -
maintenance 1
Mats and carpets should be brushed or
vacuum-cleaned regularly, to keep them free
of grit. If they are badly stained, remove them
from the vehicle for scrubbing or sponging,
and make quite sure they are dry before
refitting. Seats and interior trim panels can be
kept clean by wiping with a damp cloth. If they
do become stained (which can be more
apparent on light-coloured upholstery), use a
little liquid detergent and a soft nail brush to
scour the grime out of the grain of the
material. Do not forget to keep the headlining
clean in the same way as the upholstery.
When using liquid cleaners inside the vehicle,
do not over-wet the surfaces being cleaned.
Excessive damp could get into the seams and
padded interior, causing stains, offensive
odours or even rot.
5 Bodywork repair - 
minor damage 3
Note: For more detailed information about
bodywork repair, Haynes Publishing produce
a book by Lindsay Porter called “The Car
Bodywork Repair Manual”. This incorporates
information on such aspects as rust treatment,
painting and glass-fibre repairs, as well as
details on more ambitious repairs involving
welding and panel beating.
Repairs of minor scratches in
bodywork
If the scratch is very superficial, and does
not penetrate to the metal of the bodywork,
repair is very simple. Lightly rub the area of
the scratch with a paintwork renovator, or a
very fine cutting paste, to remove loose paint
from the scratch, and to clear the surrounding
bodywork of wax polish. Rinse the area with
clean water.
Apply touch-up paint to the scratch using a
fine paint brush; continue to apply fine layers
of paint until the surface of the paint in the
scratch is level with the surrounding
paintwork. Allow the new paint at least two
weeks to harden, then blend it into the
surrounding paintwork by rubbing the scratch
area with a paintwork renovator or a very fine
cutting paste. Finally, apply wax polish.
Where the scratch has penetrated right
through to the metal of the bodywork, causing
the metal to rust, a different repair technique
is required. Remove any loose rust from the
bottom of the scratch with a penknife, then
apply rust-inhibiting paint to prevent the
formation of rust in the future. Using a rubber
or nylon applicator, fill the scratch with
bodystopper paste. If required, this paste can
be mixed with cellulose thinners to provide a
very thin paste which is ideal for filling narrow
scratches. Before the stopper-paste in the
scratch hardens, wrap a piece of smooth
cotton rag around the top of a finger. Dip the
finger in cellulose thinners, and quickly sweep
it across the surface of the stopper-paste in
the scratch; this will ensure that the surface of
the stopper-paste is slightly hollowed. The
scratch can now be painted over as described
earlier in this Section.
Repairs of dents in bodywork
When deep denting of the vehicle’s
bodywork has taken place, the first task is to
pull the dent out, until the affected bodywork
almost attains its original shape. There is little
point in trying to restore the original shape
completely, as the metal in the damaged area
will have stretched on impact, and cannot be
reshaped fully to its original contour. It is
better to bring the level of the dent up to a
point which is about 3 mm below the level of
the surrounding bodywork. In cases where the
dent is very shallow anyway, it is not worth
trying to pull it out at all. If the underside of the
dent is accessible, it can be hammered out
gently from behind, using a mallet with a
wooden or plastic head. Whilst doing this,
hold a suitable block of wood firmly against
the outside of the panel, to absorb the impact
from the hammer blows and thus prevent a
large area of the bodywork from being
“belled-out”.
Should the dent be in a section of the
bodywork which has a double skin, or some
other factor making it inaccessible from
behind, a different technique is called for. Drill
several small holes through the metal inside
the area - particularly in the deeper section.
Then screw long self-tapping screws into the
holes, just sufficiently for them to gain a good
purchase in the metal. Now the dent can be
pulled out by pulling on the protruding heads
of the screws with a pair of pliers.
The next stage of the repair is the removal
of the paint from the damaged area, and from
an inch or so of the surrounding “sound”
bodywork. This is accomplished most easily
by using a wire brush or abrasive pad on a
power drill, although it can be done just as
effectively by hand, using sheets of abrasive
paper. To complete the preparation for filling,
score the surface of the bare metal with a
screwdriver or the tang of a file, or
alternatively, drill small holes in the affected
area. This will provide a really good “key” for
the filler paste.
To complete the repair, see the Section on
filling and respraying.
Repairs of rust holes or gashes
in bodywork
Remove all paint from the affected area,
and from an inch or so of the surrounding
“sound” bodywork, using an abrasive pad or a
wire brush on a power drill. If these are not
available, a few sheets of abrasive paper will
do the job most effectively. With the paint
removed, you will be able to judge the severity
of the corrosion, and therefore decide
whether to renew the whole panel (if this is
possible) or to repair the affected area. New
body panels are not as expensive as most
people think, and it is often quicker and more
satisfactory to fit a new panel than to attempt
to repair large areas of corrosion.
Remove all fittings from the affected area,
except those which will act as a guide to the
original shape of the damaged bodywork (eg
headlight shells etc). Then, using tin snips or a
hacksaw blade, remove all loose metal and
any other metal badly affected by corrosion.
Hammer the edges of the hole inwards, in
order to create a slight depression for the filler
paste.
Wire-brush the affected area to remove the
powdery rust from the
surface of the remaining metal. Paint the
affected area with rust-inhibiting paint, if the
back of the rusted area is accessible, treat
this also.
Before filling can take place, it will be
necessary to block the hole in some way. This
can be achieved by the use of aluminium or
plastic mesh, or aluminium tape.
Aluminium or plastic mesh, or glass-fibre
matting, is probably the best material to use
for a large hole. Cut a piece to the
approximate size and shape of the hole to be
filled, then position it in the hole so that its
edges are below the level of the surrounding
bodywork. It can be retained in position by
several blobs of filler paste around its
periphery.
Aluminium tape should be used for small or
very narrow holes. Pull a piece off the roll, trim

it to the approximate size and shape required,
then pull off the backing paper (if used) and
stick the tape over the hole; it can be
overlapped if the thickness of one piece is
insufficient. Burnish down the edges of the
tape with the handle of a screwdriver or
similar, to ensure that the tape is securely
attached to the metal underneath.
Bodywork repairs - filling and
respraying
Before using this Section, see the Sections
on dent, deep scratch, rust holes and gash
repairs.
Many types of bodyfiller are available, but
generally speaking, those proprietary kits
which contain a tin of filler paste and a tube of
resin hardener are best for this type of repair. A
wide, flexible plastic or nylon applicator will be
found invaluable for imparting a smooth and
well-contoured finish to the surface of the filler.
Mix up a little filler on a clean piece of card
or board - measure the hardener carefully
(follow the maker’s instructions on the pack),
otherwise the filler will set too rapidly or too
slowly. Using the applicator, apply the filler
paste to the prepared area; draw the
applicator across the surface of the filler to
achieve the correct contour and to level the
surface. As soon as a contour that
approximates to the correct one is achieved,
stop working the paste - if you carry on too
long, the paste will become sticky and begin
to “pick-up” on the applicator. Continue to
add thin layers of filler paste at 20-minute
intervals, until the level of the filler is just
proud of the surrounding bodywork.
Once the filler has hardened, the excess
can be removed using a metal plane or file.
From then on, progressively-finer grades of
abrasive paper should be used, starting with a
40-grade production paper, and finishing with
a 400-grade wet-and-dry paper. Always wrap
the abrasive paper around a flat rubber, cork,
or wooden block - otherwise the surface of
the filler will not be completely flat. During the
smoothing of the filler surface, the wet-and-
dry paper should be periodically rinsed in
water. This will ensure that a very smooth
finish is imparted to the filler at the final stage.
At this stage, the “dent” should be
surrounded by a ring of bare metal, which in
turn should be encircled by the finely
“feathered” edge of the good paintwork.
Rinse the repair area with clean water, until all
of the dust produced by the rubbing-down
operation has gone.
Spray the whole area with a light coat of
primer - this will show up any imperfections in
the surface of the filler. Repair these
imperfections with fresh filler paste or
bodystopper, and once more smooth the
surface with abrasive paper. Repeat this
spray-and-repair procedure until you are
satisfied that the surface of the filler, and the
feathered edge of the paintwork, are perfect.
Clean the repair area with clean water, and
allow to dry fully.
The repair area is now ready for final
spraying. Paint spraying must be carried out
in a warm, dry, windless and dust-free
atmosphere. This condition can be created
artificially if you have access to a large indoor
working area, but if you are forced to work in
the open, you will have to pick your day very
carefully. If you are working indoors, dousing
the floor in the work area with water will help
to settle the dust which would otherwise be in
the atmosphere. If the repair area is confined
to one body panel, mask off the surrounding
panels; this will help to minimise the effects of
a slight mis-match in paint colours. Bodywork
fittings (eg chrome strips, door handles etc)
will also need to be masked off. Use genuine
masking tape, and several thicknesses of
newspaper, for the masking operations.
Before commencing to spray, agitate the
aerosol can thoroughly, then spray a test area
(an old tin, or similar) until the technique is
mastered. Cover the repair area with a thick
coat of primer; the thickness should be built
up using several thin layers of paint, rather
than one thick one. Using 400-grade wet-and-
dry paper, rub down the surface of the primer
until it is really smooth. While doing this, the
work area should be thoroughly doused with
water, and the wet-and-dry paper periodically
rinsed in water. Allow to dry before spraying
on more paint.
Spray on the top coat, again building up the
thickness by using several thin layers of paint.
Start spraying at one edge of the repair area,
and then, using a side-to-side motion, work
until the whole repair area and about 2 inches
of the surrounding original paintwork is
covered. Remove all masking material 10 to
15 minutes after spraying on the final coat of
paint.
Allow the new paint at least two weeks to
harden, then, using a paintwork renovator, or
a very fine cutting paste, blend the edges of
the paint into the existing paintwork. Finally,
apply wax polish.
Plastic components
With the use of more and more plastic body
components by the vehicle manufacturers (eg
bumpers. spoilers, and in some cases major
body panels), rectification of more serious
damage to such items has become a matter
of either entrusting repair work to a specialist
in this field, or renewing complete
components. Repair of such damage by the
DIY owner is not really feasible, owing to the
cost of the equipment and materials required
for effecting such repairs. The basic technique
involves making a groove along the line of the
crack in the plastic, using a rotary burr in a
power drill. The damaged part is then welded
back together, using a hot-air gun to heat up
and fuse a plastic filler rod into the groove.
Any excess plastic is then removed, and the
area rubbed down to a smooth finish. It is
important that a filler rod of the correct plastic
is used, as body components can be made of
a variety of different types (eg polycarbonate,
ABS, polypropylene).
Damage of a less serious nature (abrasions,
minor cracks etc) can be repaired by the DIY
owner using a two-part epoxy filler repair
material. Once mixed in equal proportions,
this is used in similar fashion to the bodywork
filler used on metal panels. The filler is usually
cured in twenty to thirty minutes, ready for
sanding and painting.
If the owner is renewing a complete
component himself, or if he has repaired it
with epoxy filler, he will be left with the
problem of finding a suitable paint for finishing
which is compatible with the type of plastic
used. At one time, the use of a universal paint
was not possible, owing to the complex range
of plastics encountered in body component
applications. Standard paints, generally
speaking, will not bond to plastic or rubber
satisfactorily. However, it is now possible to
obtain a plastic body parts finishing kit which
consists of a pre-primer treatment, a primer
and coloured top coat. Full instructions are
normally supplied with a kit, but basically, the
method of use is to first apply the pre-primer
to the component concerned, and allow it to
dry for up to 30 minutes. Then the primer is
applied, and left to dry for about an hour
before finally applying the special-coloured
top coat. The result is a correctly-coloured
component, where the paint will flex with the
plastic or rubber, a property that standard
paint does not normally possess.
6 Bodywork repair - 
major damage 5
1 Major damage must be repaired by a
qualified bodywork repair specialist, or
preferably by a BMW dealer. Specialised
equipment is required to do the job properly.
2 If the damage is extensive, the bodyshell
must be checked for proper alignment, or the
vehicle’s handling characteristics may be
adversely affected and other components
may wear at an accelerated rate.
3 Due to the fact that all of the major body
components (bonnet, wings, etc.) are
separate units, any seriously damaged
components should be replaced with new
ones rather than repaired.
Bodywork and fittings  11•3

If bodystopper is used, it can
be mixed with cellulose
thinners to form a really thin
paste which is ideal for filling
small holes
Sometimes bodywork
components can be found in
a scrapyard that specialises
in used vehicle components,
often at a considerable saving over the
cost of new parts.


7 Hinges and locks -
Every six months or so, the hinges and lock
assemblies on the doors, bonnet and the boot
lid/tailgate should be given a few drops of
light oil or lock lubricant. The door or tailgate
lock strikers should also be lubricated with a
thin coat of grease, to reduce wear and

1 General information
Warning: Whenever any of the
suspension or steering fasteners
are loosened or removed, they
must be inspected and if
necessary, new ones fitted, of the same
part number or of original-equipment
quality and design. Torque specifications
must be followed for proper reassembly
and component retention. Never attempt
to heat, straighten or weld any suspension
or steering component. Any bent or
damaged parts must be renewed.
The front suspension (see illustrations) is a
MacPherson strut design. The struts are
secured at the upper ends to reinforced areas
at the top of the wheel arches, and at the
lower ends to the steering arms/control arms.
An anti-roll bar is attached to the control arms
via connecting links, and to the suspension
subframe (3-Series models) or the underbody
(5-Series models).
The independent rear suspension system
on 3-Series models (see illustration) features
coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers.
The upper ends of the shock absorbers are
attached to the body; the lower ends are
connected to trailing arms. An anti-roll bar is
attached to the trailing arms via links, and to
the body with clamps.
The independent rear suspension system on
5-Series models (see illustration) uses coil-
over shock absorber units instead of separate
shock absorbers and coil springs. The upper
ends are attached to the body; the lower ends
are connected to the trailing arms. The rear
suspension of 5-Series models is otherwise
similar to that of 3-Series models: two trailing
arms connected by an anti-roll bar.
The steering system consists of the
steering wheel, a steering column, a universal
joint shaft, the steering gear, the power
steering pump (where fitted) and the steering
linkage, which connects the steering gear to
the steering arms. On 3-Series models, a
rack-and-pinion steering gear is attached
directly to the steering arms via the track rods
and track rod ends. On 5-Series models, a
recirculating-ball steering box is connected to
the steering arms via a Pitman arm, a centre
track rod, the outer track rods and the track

bar itself, or disconnecting the bar to renew
the strut assembly on a 3-Series model,
disconnect it from the anti-roll bar links (see
illustrations). If you’re renewing the strut
assembly on a 5-Series model, disconnect the
anti-roll bar link from the strut housing.
3 On 3-Series models, disconnect the left
control arm rubber bush from the underbody
(see Section 3).
4 Remove the bolts from the anti-roll bar
brackets which attach the anti-roll bar to the
subframe (see illustration).
5 Remove the anti-roll bar from the vehicle.
Where necessary, separate the anti-roll bar
from the strut bar bracket.
Refitting
6 Refitting is the reverse of the removal
procedure. Be sure to tighten all nuts and
bolts to the torques listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
3 Control arm (3-Series) -
inspection, removal and
refitting, and bush renewal
3
Inspection
1 Raise the front end of the vehicle, and
support it securely on axle stands.
2 Grip the top and bottom of each balljoint
with a large pair of water pump (“parrot jaw”)
pliers, and squeeze to check for free play.
Alternatively, insert a lever or large
screwdriver between the control arm and the
subframe or strut housing. If there’s any free
play, renew the control arm (the balljoints
can’t be renewed separately).
3 Inspect the rubber bush. If it’s cracked, dry,
torn or otherwise deteriorated, renew it (see
below).
Bush renewal
Note: Rubber bushes should always be
renewed in pairs. Make sure both new bushes
have the same markings (indicating they’re
manufactured by the same firm).
4 Remove the two bolts (see illustration) which
attach the bush bracket to the underbody.
5 Using a puller, remove the bracket and
bush from the end of the control arm. If the
puller slips on the end of the control arm,
centre-punch the control arm to give the
puller bolt a place to seat.
6 Note the orientation of the old bush. This is
exactly how the new bush should be
orientated when it’s fitted. Press the old
rubber bush out of the bracket, or have it
pressed out by an engineering works.
7 Coat the end of the control arm with BMW’s
special lubricant (Part No. 81 22 9 407 284),
and press the new bush and bracket onto the
arm - or have it pressed on at an engineering
works - all the way to the stop.
Caution: Don’t try to use any
other type of lubricant; 
30 minutes after it’s applied, this
lubricant loses its properties and
the bush is permanently located in its
proper position. Make sure the new bush
is pressed on so it’s orientated exactly the
same way as the old bush.
8 Refit the bracket bolts and tighten them to
the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
9 Lower the vehicle, and leave it at rest for at
least 30 minutes (this will give the special
lubricant time to dry).
Control arm removal and
refitting
Note: If either balljoint is worn or damaged,
the only way to renew it is to renew the control
arm. If you’re fitting a new control arm, a new
bush must also be fitted. The old bush can’t
be removed from the old control arm and re-
used in the new control arm.
10 Loosen but do not remove the wheel
bolts, raise the front of the vehicle and
support it on axle stands. Remove the wheel
bolts and the front wheel.
11 Remove the two bolts which attach the
rubber bush bracket to the underbody (see
illustration 3.4).
12 Remove the nut which secures the control
arm balljoint to the subframe, and remove the
balljoint stud from the subframe. Note: It may
be necessary to use a balljoint separator to
separate the balljoint from the subframe (see
illustration), but take care not to damage the
10•4 Suspension and steering systems
3.12  Remove the self-locking nut from the
balljoint stud protruding through the top of
the subframe (not shown in this photo, but
it’s directly above the balljoint) and
separate the balljoint from the subframe.
Try not to damage the dust boot
3.4  Remove the two bolts (arrowed)
securing the bush bracket to the
underbody
2.4  Remove the bolts (arrowed) from the
anti-roll bar brackets to detach the anti-
roll bar from the subframe (3-Series model

2.2b  On 5-Series models, remove the nut
(arrowed) securing the anti-roll bar to the
connecting link (left side shown, right side
similar)
2.2a  On 3-Series models, remove the nut
(upper arrow) securing the anti-roll bar to
the upper end of the connecting link (left
side shown, right side similar). If a new
control arm is being fitted, remove the
lower nut (lower arrow) and disconnect the
link assembly and bracket from the arm


dust boot. If the boot does become damaged
(and you’re refitting the same control arm and
balljoint), be sure to fit a new boot.
13 Unscrew the nut which secures the outer
control arm balljoint to the steering knuckle
(see illustration) and detach the balljoint stud
from the knuckle (see illustration). Ideally you
should use a purpose-made balljoint
separator tool for this job. Using a hammer is
OK if you’re going to fit new parts anyway, but
is not recommended if you’re planning to re-
use parts.
14 Remove the control arm.
15 If you’re renewing the control arm, you’ll
have to fit a new bush (see above). The old
bush can’t be removed re-used in another
control arm.
16 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure
to use new self-locking nuts on the balljoint
studs and tighten them, and the bush bracket
bolts, to the torques listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
17 When you’re finished, have the front
wheel alignment checked by a dealer service
department or qualified garage.
4 Control and thrust arms 
(5-Series) - inspection, removal
and refitting and bush renewal
3
Inspection
1 Inspect the thrust arm rubber bush (see
illustration 4.6b). If the bush is cracked, torn
or otherwise deteriorated, renew it. The
control arm bush can’t be inspected until the
control arm is removed.
2 Raise the vehicle and place it securely on
axle stands.
3 To inspect the control arm and thrust arm
balljoints for wear, grip the top and bottom of
each balljoint with a large pair of water pump
(“parrot jaw”) pliers, and try to squeeze them.
Alternatively, use a lever or large screwdriver
to move them up and down. If there’s any free
play, renew the control arm or thrust arm. The
balljoints can’t be renewed separately.
Removal
Note: If a balljoint is worn or damaged, the
only way to renew it is to renew the control
arm or thrust arm. If you’re fitting a new
control arm or thrust arm, a new bush must
also be fitted. The old bush can’t be removed
from the old control arm or thrust arm and re-
used in the new arm.
4 Loosen the wheel bolts, raise the vehicle
and support it securely on axle stands.
Remove the wheel.
5 If you’re removing the control arm, remove
the three bolts from the steering arm (see
illustration) and separate the strut assembly
from the arm.
6 Remove the nut and the through-bolt that
secure the control arm or thrust arm rear
mounting (see illustrations).
7 Remove the nut from the balljoint (see
illustration). Support the steering arm and
separate the balljoint from the steering arm
(see illustrations). Ideally you should use a
purpose-made balljoint separator tool for this
job. Using a hammer is OK if you’re going to
fit new parts anyway, but is not recommended
if you’re planning to re-use parts.

remove the nut and bolt (arrowed) that
secure the rear end of the arm


Bush inspection and renewal
8 If the bush is cracked, torn or otherwise
deteriorated, take the arm to a BMW dealer
service department or an engineering works,
and have it pressed out and a new bush
pressed in. Bushes should always be renewed
in pairs (a new bush should be fitted in each
arm, and both bushes should have the same
manufacturer markings). If you’re fitting a new
thrust arm bush, make sure it’s correctly
orientated (see illustration).
Refitting
9 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure
to use new self-locking nuts on the balljoint
stud nut and the through-bolt. Don’t forget to
refit the washers on both sides of the through-
bolt. If you’re refitting the control arm, be sure
to use thread-locking compound on the
steering arm mounting bolts. Don’t tighten the
through-bolt to the final torque yet. Note:
Thrust arms are marked “L” for the left side,
and “R” for the right side. Be sure to check the
marking before fitting a new arm.
10 Support the control arm with a trolley
jack, and raise it to simulate normal ride
height, then tighten the through-bolt to the
torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
Refit the wheel and tighten the wheel bolts to
the torque listed in the Chapter 1 Specifi-
cations.
11 Have the front end alignment checked at
a dealer service department or qualified
garage.
5 Front strut assembly -
removal and refitting 3
Removal
Note: Although strut assemblies don’t always
fail or wear out simultaneously, renew both left
and right struts at the same time, to prevent
handling peculiarities or abnormal ride quality.
1 Loosen but do not remove the front wheel
bolts.
2 Raise the front of the vehicle and support it
on axle stands.
3 Remove the front wheel.
4 Detach all brake hoses and electrical wires
attached to the strut housing.
5 Disconnect the electrical connections for
the ABS system, if applicable.
6 If you’re removing the left strut, disconnect
the electrical connector for the brake pad
wear sensor.
7 Remove the bolt securing the ABS wheel
sensor, if applicable. Remove the brake disc
(see Chapter 9).
8 Remove the brake splash shield (see
illustration).
9 On 3-Series models, disconnect the anti-
roll bar from its connecting link (see Sec-
tion 2). On 5-Series models, disconnect the
anti-roll bar link from the strut housing (see
Section 2).
10 On 3-Series models, disconnect the
control arm balljoint from the steering knuckle
(see Section 3) and the track rod end from the
steering arm (see Section 17).
11 On 5-Series models, disconnect the bolts
that attach the steering arm to the strut
housing (see illustration 4.5).
12 Pull out the lower end of the strut housing
far enough to clear the end of the control arm
(3-Series) or the steering arm (5-Series).
13 Support the weight of the strut and
remove the three mounting nuts at the top of
the strut, located inside the engine
compartment (see illustration) and remove
the strut.
14 Remove the strut assembly. If a new
shock absorber (strut cartridge) is being fitted,
see Section 6.
Refitting
15 Refitting is the reverse of removal. On 
3-Series models, be sure to use new self-
locking nuts on the control arm balljoint, the
track rod end balljoint and the strut upper
mountings. On 5-Series models, make sure
the tang in the steering arm is mated with the
notch in the strut housing (see illustration).
BMW recommends using a thread-locking
compound on the steering arm mounting
bolts. On all models, tighten the fasteners to
the torques listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
16 When you’re done, drive the vehicle to a
dealer service department or qualified garage
and have the wheel alignment checked, and if
necessary, adjusted.

6 Strut or shock absorber/coil
spring - renewal 4
Note: This section applies to all front strut
assemblies and, on 5-Series models, the rear
coil-over shock absorber assemblies.
1 If the struts, shock absorbers or coil springs
exhibit the telltale signs of wear (leaking fluid,
loss of damping capability, chipped, sagging
or cracked coil springs) explore all options
before beginning any work. Strut or shock
absorber assemblies complete with springs
may be available on an exchange basis, which
eliminates much time and work. Whichever
route you choose to take, check on the cost
and availability of parts before dismantling the
vehicle.
Warning: Dismantling a strut or
coil-over shock absorber
assembly is a potentially
dangerous undertaking, and
utmost attention must be directed to the
job, or serious injury may result. Use only a
high-quality spring compressor, and
carefully follow the manufacturer’s
instructions supplied with the tool. After
removing the coil spring from the strut
assembly, set it aside in a safe, isolated
area.
2 Remove the strut or shock absorber
assembly (see Section 5 or 11). Mount the
assembly in a vice. Line the vice jaws with
wood or rags to prevent damage to the unit,
and don’t tighten the vice excessively.
3 Following the tool manufacturer’s
instructions, fit the spring compressor (these
can be obtained at most car accessory shops,
or it may be possible to hire one) on the
spring, and compress it sufficiently to relieve
all pressure from the suspension support (see
illustration). This can be verified by wiggling
the spring.
4 Prise the protective cap off the damper rod
self-locking nut. Loosen the nut (see
illustration) with a spanner while holding the
damper rod stationary with another spanner
or an Allen key.
5 Remove the nut, the strut bearing, the
insulator and the large washer. Check the
bearing for smooth operation. If it doesn’t turn
smoothly, renew it. Check the rubber insulator
for cracking and general deterioration. If there
is any separation of the rubber, renew the
insulator.
6 Lift off the spring retainer and the rubber
ring at the top of the spring. Check the rubber
ring for cracking and hardness. Renew it if
necessary.
7 Carefully lift the compressed spring from
the assembly and set it in a safe place, such
as a steel cabinet.
Warning: Never place your head
near the end of the spring!
8 Slide the protective tube and rubber
bumper off the damper rod. If either is
damaged or worn, renew it.
9 If you’re working on a front strut, loosen
and remove the threaded collar (see
illustration) and pull the old strut cartridge
from the strut housing. Pour the old oil from
the strut housing.
10 On all struts except gas-charged units, fill
the strut housing with 20 to 25 cc (3-Series),
42 to 47 cc (518i and 520i 5-Series models) or
20 to 25 cc (all other 5-Series models) of
engine oil (the oil helps cool the shock
absorber by transferring heat to the strut
housing). Note: It doesn’t matter what
viscosity or grade of engine oil is used.
11 Refitting is otherwise the reverse of
removal. Tighten the threaded collar to the
torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
Make sure you align the end of the coil spring
with the shoulder of the rubber ring and with
the spring retainer (see illustration). Tighten
the damper rod nut to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. 
12 Refit the strut or shock absorber
assembly (see Section 5 or 11).
7 Balljoints - check and renewal 3
Check
Note: On 3-Series models, there are two
balljoints on each control arm - one between
the middle of the arm and the subframe, and
the other between the outer end of the arm
and the steering knuckle. On 5-Series models,
there are balljoints on the outer ends of the
control arm and the thrust arm.
1 Raise the vehicle and support it securely on
axle stands.
2 Visually inspect the rubber boot between
the balljoint and the subframe or steering
knuckle, etc for cuts, tears or leaking grease.
If you note any of these conditions, renew the
control arm or thrust arm - the balljoints are
not available separately.
3 Place a large lever under the balljoint, and
try to push the balljoint up. Next, position the
lever between the arm and the subframe or
between the arm and steering knuckle. If you
can see or feel any movement during either
check, a worn balljoint is indicated.
4 Have an assistant grasp the tyre at the top
and bottom, and shake the top of the tyre with
an in-and-out motion. Touch the balljoint stud
nut. If any looseness is felt, suspect a worn
balljoint stud or a widened hole in the
subframe or steering knuckle. If the latter

problem exists, a new subframe or steering
arm (5-Series) or steering knuckle (3-Series),
which is integral with the strut housing, should
be fitted as well as the new balljoint.
Note: None of these balljoints can be serviced
or renewed individually. If one of them is worn,
a complete new arm must be fitted.
8 Front hub and wheel bearing
assembly - 
removal and refitting
3
Note: Removing the front hub/bearing
assembly renders it unfit for re-use. A new
assembly will be required for refitting.
Removal
1 Loosen the wheel bolts, then raise the front
of the vehicle, and support it securely on axle
stands. Remove the wheel bolts and the
wheel.
2 Using a hammer and chisel, remove the
dust cap from the centre of the wheel hub
(see illustration).
3 Unstake the hub nut (see illustration).
4 Refit the wheel and lower the vehicle to the
ground. Loosen, but do not remove, the hub
nut.
Warning: Always loosen and
tighten the hub nut with the
vehicle on the ground. The
leverage needed to loosen the nut (which
is very tight) could topple the vehicle off a
lift or an axle stand.
5 Raise the front of the vehicle, support it
securely on axle stands, and remove the front
wheel again.
6 Remove the front brake caliper and
mounting bracket (see Chapter 9). There is no
need to disconnect the brake hose. Hang the
caliper out of the way with a piece of wire.
7 Remove the brake disc (see Chapter 9).
8 Remove the hub nut, and pull the hub and
bearing assembly off the stub axle. You may
have to tap it off if it’s stuck (see illustration).
If the inner race of the bearing remains on the
stub axle (it probably will), remove the dust
shield (rubber boot) behind the bearing, and
use a puller to remove the inner race (see
illustration).
Refitting
9 Fit a new dust shield.
10 Push the new hub and bearing onto the
stub axle. If it’s necessary to use force, press
or drive only against the bearing inner race
(see illustration).
11 Fit a new hub nut, and tighten it finger-
tight at this stage.
12 Refit the brake disc, its countersunk
retaining screw, and the brake caliper (see
Chapter 9).
13 Refit the wheel, and lower the vehicle to
the ground.
14 Tighten the hub nut to the torque listed in
this Chapter’s Specifications. Again, make
sure you do this with the vehicle on the
ground, not up on axle stands.
15 Raise the front of the vehicle and place it
securely on axle stands. Remove the wheel.
16 Stake the collar of the nut into the groove
of the spindle.
17 Apply suitable sealant to a new grease
cap, and fit the cap by driving it into place
with a soft-faced mallet.
18 Refit the wheel and wheel bolts. Lower the
vehicle to the ground, and tighten the wheel
bolts to the torque listed in the Chapter 1
Specifications.
9 Rear shock  absorbers 
(3-Series) - 
removal and refitting
3
Removal
Note: Although shock absorbers don’t always
wear out simultaneously, renew both left and
right shock absorbers at the same time, to
prevent handling peculiarities or abnormal ride
quality.
1 Chock the front wheels.
2 Raise the rear of the vehicle, and support it
securely on axle stands. Support the trailing
arm with a trolley jack. Place a block of wood
on the jack head to serve as a cushion.
3 Remove the shock absorber lower
mounting bolt (see illustration).

4 On some models, working inside the boot,
you can remove the trim to access the upper
mounting nuts; on later models, you’ll have to
remove the rear seat back to get at the upper
mounting nuts. On Touring (Estate) models,
remove the side backrest and rear seat belt
reels, and unscrew the centring shell on the
wheel arch. On Convertibles, simply remove
the top from the recessed well behind the
passenger compartment, and remove the
small rubber access cover. As you remove the
mounting nuts (see illustration), have an
assistant support the shock absorber from
below so it doesn’t fall out.
5 Look for oil leaking past the seal in the top
of the shock absorber body. Inspect the
rubber bushings in the shock absorber eye. If
they’re cracked, dried or torn, renew them. To
test the shock absorber, grasp the shock
absorber body firmly with one hand, and push
the damper rod in and out with the other. The
strokes should be smooth and firm. If the rod
goes in and out too easily, or unevenly, the
shock absorber is defective and must be
renewed.
Refitting
6 Fit the shock absorbers in the reverse order
of removal, but don’t tighten the mounting
bolts and nuts yet.
7 Bounce the rear of the vehicle a couple of
times to settle the bushings, then tighten the
nuts and bolts to the torque values listed in
this Chapter’s Specifications.
10 Rear coil springs (3-Series) -
removal and refitting 4
Note: Although coil springs don’t always wear
out simultaneously, renew both left and right
springs at the same time, to prevent handling
peculiarities or abnormal ride quality.
Removal
1 Loosen the wheel bolts. Chock the front
wheels, then raise the rear of the vehicle and
support it securely on axle stands. Make sure
the stands don’t interfere with the rear
suspension when it’s lowered and raised
during this procedure. Remove the wheels.
2 Disconnect the mountings and brackets
which support the rear portion of the exhaust
system, and temporarily lower the exhaust
system (see Chapter 4). Lower the exhaust
system only enough to lower the suspension
and remove the springs. Suspend the exhaust
with a piece of wire.
3 Support the differential with a trolley jack,
then remove the differential rear mounting
bolt. Push the differential down, and wedge it
into this lowered position with a block of
wood. This reduces the drive angle,
preventing damage to the CV joints when the
trailing arms are lowered to remove the
springs.
4 Place a trolley jack under the trailing arm.
5 If the vehicle has a rear anti-roll bar,
disconnect the bar from its connecting links,
or disconnect the links from the trailing arms
(see Section 12).
6 Loop a chain through the coil spring, and
bolt the chain together, to prevent the coil
spring from popping out when the trailing arm
is lowered. Be sure to leave enough slack in
the chain to allow the spring to extend
completely.
7 Disconnect the shock absorber lower
mounting bolt (see Section 9), carefully lower
the trailing arm and remove the coil spring.
Refitting
8 Refitting is the reverse of removal. As the
trailing arm is raised back up, make sure the
spring seats properly.
11 Rear shock absorber/coil
spring assembly (5-Series) -
removal and refitting 4
Removal
Note: Although shock absorbers don’t always
wear out simultaneously, renew both left and
right shock absorbers at the same time, to
prevent handling peculiarities or abnormal ride
quality.
1 Loosen the wheel bolts, then chock the
front wheels. Raise the vehicle and support it
securely on axle stands. Remove the wheels.
2 Remove the shock absorber lower
mounting bolt (see illustration).
3 On early models, peel back the trim inside
the luggage compartment far enough to
access the upper mounting nuts. To get at the
upper mounting nuts on later models, first
remove the rear seat cushion (see Chap-
ter 11), then remove the two bolts holding the
rear seat backrest, and remove the backrest.
Support the trailing arm with a jack, and
remove the upper mounting nuts (see
illustration). Lower the jack, and remove the
shock absorber and the gasket. To separate
the shock absorber and spring, refer to
Section 6.
Refitting
4 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Don’t
forget to fit the gasket between the upper end
of the shock absorber and the body. Tighten
the upper nuts to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. Don’t tighten the
lower bolt until the vehicle is lowered.
5 Lower the vehicle, and with it sitting at the
normal ride height, tighten the lower bolt to
the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
12 Rear anti-roll bar - 
removal and refitting 2
Removal
Note: The rear anti-roll bar is mounted
basically the same way on all models. Follow
these general removal and refitting
procedures, keeping in mind any variations.
1 Chock the front wheels, then raise the rear
of the vehicle and support it securely on axle
stands.
2 Remove the anti-roll bar bracket bolts or
nuts (see illustration).
3 Disconnect the anti-roll bar from the link at
each end of the bar (see illustrations) and
detach the anti-roll bar.

- removal and refitting 3
1 Loosen the wheel bolts, then chock the
front wheels. Raise the rear of the vehicle, and
support it securely on axle stands. Remove
the wheel(s).
2 Remove the driveshaft (see Chapter 8), or
disconnect it from the final drive output
flange.
3 Disconnect the rear brake hose from the
metal brake line at the bracket on the trailing
arm (see illustration). Note: For information
on disconnecting brake hose-to-metal line
connections, see Chapter 9. Plug the line and
hose, to prevent dirt ingress and loss of brake
fluid.
4 Disconnect the handbrake cable (see
Chapter 9).
5 Disconnect the lower end of the shock
absorber from the trailing arm (see Section 9),
and lower the trailing arm.
6 Remove the trailing arm pivot bolts (see
illustration) and remove the trailing arm.
7 Inspect the pivot bolt bushes. If they’re
cracked, dried out or torn, take the trailing
arm to an engineering works and have them
new ones fitted. Each bush has a larger
diameter shoulder on one end. Make sure this
larger diameter shoulder on each bush faces
away from the trailing arm, ie the inner bush
shoulder faces the centre of the vehicle, and
the outer bush shoulder faces away from the
vehicle.
8 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Support
the trailing arm with a trolley jack, and raise it
to simulate normal ride height, then tighten
the nuts and bolts to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. Be sure to bleed the
brakes as described in Chapter 9.

2 Remove the driveshaft (see Chapter 8).
3 Disconnect the rear brake hose from the
metal brake line at the bracket on the trailing
arm (see illustration). Note: For information
on disconnecting brake hose-to-metal line
connections, see Chapter 9. Plug the line and
hose, to prevent dirt ingress and loss of brake
fluid.
4 Disconnect the handbrake cable from the
handbrake actuator, and unclip the handbrake
cable from the trailing arm (see Chapter 9).
5 Remove the ABS wheel sensor (if
applicable) from the trailing arm, and unclip
the sensor wire harness from the arm.
Position the sensor aside so it won’t be
damaged during removal of the trailing arm.
6 If you’re removing the right trailing arm,
unplug the connector for the brake pad wear
sensor, if applicable.
7 Disconnect the rear anti-roll bar from the
trailing arm (see Section 12).
8 On 1983 and later models, remove one of
the rear axle carrier bolts (see illustration).
9 Disconnect the shock absorber lower
mounting bolt (see Section 11).
10 Remove the two trailing arm pivot bolts
and nuts, and remove the trailing arm from the
vehicle.
11 Inspect the pivot bolt bushes. If they’re
cracked, dried out or torn, take the trailing
arm to an engineering works, and have new
ones fitted. The bush inner sleeve is longer on
one side. Make sure the bushes are fitted with

15 Rear wheel bearings -
renewal 4
3-Series models
1 Loosen the driveshaft nut and the rear
wheel bolts, then chock the front wheels.
Raise the rear of the vehicle and place it
securely on axle stands. Remove the rear
wheel. Note: Depending on the type of rear
wheel, it may be necessary to remove the
wheel first, remove the hubcap, then refit the
wheel and loosen the driveshaft nut.
2 Remove the driveshaft (see Chapter 8).
3 On models with rear brake drums, remove
the drum. On models with rear disc brakes,
remove the brake caliper and mounting
bracket. Don’t disconnect the hose. Hang the
caliper out of the way with a piece of wire.
Remove the brake disc (see Chapter 9).
Working from behind, drive the wheel hub out
of the wheel bearing with a large socket or a
piece of pipe.
4 Remove the large circlip (see illustration)
that holds the wheel bearing in the wheel
bearing housing, then drive out the bearing
with a large socket or piece of pipe.
5 Refitting is basically the reverse of removal,
bearing in mind the following points:
a) Be extremely careful where you place the
socket or piece of pipe when you drive
the new bearing into the housing. It
should be butted up against the outer
race of the bearing. Driving in the new
bearing using the inner race will ruin the
bearing.
b) Refit the wheel and lower the vehicle to
the ground before attempting to tighten
the driveshaft nut to the torque listed in
the Chapter 8 Specifications.
5-Series models
6 Chock the front wheels, then raise the rear
of the vehicle and support it securely on axle
stands. Disconnect the outer CV joint from the
drive flange (see Chapter 8). Support the outer
end of the driveshaft with a piece of wire -
don’t let it hang, as this could damage the
inner CV joint.
7 Prise out the lockplate that secures the
drive flange nut (see illustration). Once
you’ve prised out an edge of the lockplate,
pull it out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.
8 Lower the vehicle and unscrew the drive
flange nut, but don’t remove it yet. You’ll need
a long bar (see illustration).
Warning: Don’t attempt to loosen
this nut with the vehicle on axle
stands. The force required to
loosen the nut could topple the
vehicle from the stands.
9 Loosen the rear wheel bolts, raise the rear
of the vehicle again, place it securely on axle
stands and remove the wheel.
10 Remove the brake caliper and the brake
disc (see Chapter 9). Hang the caliper out of
the way with a piece of wire.
11 Remove the drive flange nut. Using a
suitable puller, remove the drive flange (see
illustration).
12 Using a soft-faced hammer, drive the stub
axle out of the bearing (see illustration). If the
bearing inner race comes off with the stub

axle (it probably will), use a puller to remove
the race from the stub axle. If you can’t get
the race off with a puller, take the stub axle to
an engineering works and have it pressed off.
13 Remove the large circlip that retains the
bearing in the bearing housing (see
illustration), then drive the bearing out of the
bearing housing with a large socket or a
suitable piece of pipe (see illustration).
14 Refitting is basically a reversal of removal,
bearing in mind the following points:
a) Fit the new bearing using a large socket
or a suitable piece of pipe, with an
outside diameter the same diameter as
the outer race (see illustration). Don’t
apply force to the inner race. Make sure
the bearing is fully seated against the
back of the bore. Refit the circlip, making
sure it’s fully seated into its groove.
b) BMW dealers use special tools (Part Nos.
23 1 1300, 33 4 080 and 33 4 020) to pull
the stub axle into the bearing, because
the smooth portion between the splined
portion of the stub axle and the flange is a
press-fit, and knocks out the wheel
bearing inner race during refitting of the
stub axle. However, you can refit the stub
axle without these tools, using the old
inner race and a piece of pipe 13 mm
long by 38 mm inside diameter (see
illustration). First, insert the stub axle
through the new bearing until the
threaded portion protrudes from the inner
race. Refit the nut and tighten it until the
splined portion of the stub axle shaft
bottoms against the nut. You’ll need to
hold the stub axle flange with a lever or a
large screwdriver while tightening the nut
(see illustration). Remove the nut, refit
your piece of pipe, centred on the inner
race and refit the nut (see illustration).
Tighten the nut again until it bottoms
against the splines. Remove the nut, refit
the old inner race, refit the nut and tighten
it once more until it bottoms against the
splines. Remove the nut, remove the old
inner race, refit your piece of pipe, refit
the old inner race, refit the nut and tighten
it until it bottoms against the splines.
Remove the nut, the old race and the
pipe. Refit the drive flange, refit the nut
and tighten it securely, but don’t attempt
to tighten it to the final torque until the
vehicle is lowered to the ground.
c) Refit the wheel and lower the vehicle to
the ground before tightening the stub axle
nut to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
15 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal.
16 Steering system - 
general information
On 3-Series models, the steering wheel and
steering column are connected to a rack-and-
pinion steering gear (power-assisted where
applicable) via a short universal joint shaft.
When the steering wheel is turned, the
steering column and universal joint turn a
pinion gear shaft on top of the rack. The
pinion gear teeth mesh with the gear teeth of
the rack, so the rack moves right or left in the
housing when the pinion is turned. The
movement of the rack is transmitted through
the track rods and track rod ends to the
steering arms, which are an integral part of
the strut housings.
On 5-Series models, the upper part of the
steering system is identical to a 3-Series.
Instead of a rack-and-pinion set-up, however,
these models use a power-assisted
recirculating ball steering box which steers
the front wheels via a steering linkage
consisting of a Pitman arm, an idler arm, a
centre track rod, a pair of inner track rods,
and two track rod ends.
10•12 Suspension and steering systems

15.14a  To refit the new bearing, use a
large socket or a piece of pipe with an
outside diameter the same diameter as the
outer race of the bearing - don’t apply
force to the inner race - and make sure the
bearing is fully seated against the back of
its bore
15.13b  . . . then drive the bearing out of
the housing with a large socket or a
suitable piece of pipe
15.13a  Remove the large circlip that
retains the bearing in the housing . . .


Where power-assistance is fitted, hydraulic
pressure (provided by an engine-driven pump)
delivers power steering fluid to the rack-and-
pinion steering gear or the recirculating-ball
steering box - this enhances steering
response and reduces steering effort.
Aside from maintaining the proper level of
power steering fluid in the system and
checking the tension of the drivebelt (see
Chapter 1, where applicable), the steering
system requires no maintenance. However,
on high-mileage vehicles, the track rod end
balljoints, the universal joints on either end of
the universal joint shaft, and the rubber
coupling between the steering column and the
universal joint shaft will wear, develop
excessive play, and cause the steering to feel
somewhat loose. At this point, you’ll have to
renew these items; they can’t be serviced.
Before you conclude that the steering
system needs work, however, always check
the tyres (see Section 25) and tyre pressures
(see Chapter 1). Also inspect the bearings in
the strut upper mounts (see Section 5), the
front hub bearings (see Section 8) and other
suspension parts, which may also be
contributing to an imprecise steering feel.
17 Track rod ends - 
removal and refitting 4
1 Loosen but do not remove the wheel bolts,
then raise the front of the vehicle and secure it
on axle stands. Remove the front wheel.
3-Series models
2 Loosen the nut on the track rod balljoint
stud, and free the balljoint stud from the
steering arm using a balljoint separator. In the
absence of a separator tool, try giving the
steering arm a few light blows with a hammer
(see illustration). Remove the nut, and
separate the balljoint stud from the steering
arm.
3 Loosen the clamp bolt that locks the track
rod end to the inner track rod. Measure the
length of the track rod end, or paint an
alignment mark on the threads to ensure the
track rod end is refitted in the same position
(see illustration). Unscrew the track rod end
from the inner track rod.
4 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Make
sure the mark you made on the threads of the
track rod end is aligned correctly, if
applicable. If you measured the track rod end,
make sure it is refitted to the same distance.
5 Have the toe-in checked and, if necessary,
adjusted at a dealer service department or
qualified garage.
5-Series models
6 Measure the length of the track rod and
record your measurement, or paint an
alignment mark on the threads to ensure the
track rod end is refitted in the same position
(see illustration). Loosen the clamp bolt.
7 Use a balljoint separator or a puller to
separate the track rod end from the steering
arm (see illustration).
8 Unscrew the track rod end.
9 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Make
sure you align the paint mark made on the
threads of the track rod end, if applicable. If
you measured the track rod end, make sure it
is refitted to the same distance.

(3-Series) - renewal 4
1 Remove the track rod ends (see Sec-
tion 17).
2 Cut the boot clamps at both ends of the old
boots, and slide off the boots.
3 While the boots are removed, inspect the
seals in the end of the steering gear. If they’re
leaking, renew the steering gear (see Sec-
tion 19).
4 Slide the new boots into place and fit new
boot clamps.
5 Refit the track rod ends (see Section 17).

Removal
1 Loosen but do not remove the wheel bolts,
raise the vehicle and support it securely on
axle stands. Remove the front wheels.
2 Mark the lower universal joint on the
steering shaft and the pinion shaft, to ensure
proper alignment when they’re reassembled.
Remove the nut and bolt that attach the lower
end of the universal joint shaft to the steering
gear pinion shaft. Loosen the bolt and nut at
the upper end of the universal joint shaft. Slide
the universal joint shaft up a little, disengage it
from the pinion shaft, and remove it. Inspect
the universal joints and the rubber coupling
for wear. If any of them are worn or defective,
renew the universal joint shaft.

4 On power steering models, remove the
banjo bolts and disconnect the power
steering pressure and return lines from the
steering gear. Place a container under the
lines to catch spilled fluid. Plug the lines to
prevent excessive fluid loss and
contamination. Discard the sealing washers
(new ones should be used when
reassembling).
5 Disconnect the track rod ends from the
steering arms (see Section 17).
6 Remove the nuts and bolts from the
steering gear mounting brackets (see
illustration). Discard the old nuts.
7 Withdraw the assembly from beneath the
vehicle. Take care not to damage the steering
gear boots.
Refitting
8 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Make
sure the marks you made on the lower
universal joint and the pinion shaft are aligned
before you tighten the clamping bolts for the
upper and lower universal joints. Use new
self-locking nuts on the steering rack
mounting bolts, and new sealing washers on
the hydraulic line fittings. Tighten the
mounting bolts, the track rod end nuts and the
universal joint shaft clamping bolts to the
torque values listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
9 Lower the vehicle to the ground.
10 On power steering models, fill the
reservoir with the recommended fluid (see
Chapter 1) and bleed the power steering
system (see Section 23).
11 It’s a good idea to have the front wheel
alignment checked by a dealer service
department or qualified garage.
20 Steering linkage (5-Series) -
inspection, removal and
refitting
4
Inspection
1 Raise the vehicle and place it securely on
axle stands.
2 Firmly grasp each front tyre at the top and
bottom, then at the front and rear, and check
for play in the steering linkage by rocking the
tyre back and forth. There should be little or
no play in any of the linkage balljoints. Inspect
the Pitman arm, the idler arm, the centre track
rod, the inner track rods, the track rod ends
and the steering arms for any obvious
damage. Try forcing the linkage parts in
opposite directions from one another. There
should be no play between any of them. If any
of the parts are bent or damaged in any way,
or if any of the balljoints are worn, renew the
parts concerned.
Removal
3 Before dismantling the steering linkage,
obtain a suitable balljoint separator. A two-jaw
puller or a wedge-type tool will work (although
the wedge-type tends to tear the balljoint
boots). Sometimes, you can also jar a balljoint
taper pin free from its eye by striking opposite
sides of the eye simultaneously with two large
hammers, but the space available to do this is
limited, and the balljoint stud sometimes
sticks to the eye because of rust and dirt.
There is also a risk of damaging the
component being struck.
4 To remove the outer track rods, disconnect
the track rod ends from the steering arms (see
Section 17). Remove the nut that attaches the
balljoint on the inner end of each outer track
rod to the centre track rod (see illustration).
Using a balljoint separator, disconnect the
outer track rods from the centre track rod. If
you’re renewing the balljoint at either end of
the outer track rods, paint or scribe alignment
marks on the threads to mark their respective
positions as a guide to adjustment during
reassembly (see illustration 17.3).
5 To remove the centre track rod, remove the
nuts that attach the centre track rod balljoints
to the Pitman arm and the idler arm, and use a
balljoint separator to disconnect the balljoints
from the two arms.
6 To remove the Pitman arm, you’ll have to
remove the steering box first (see Section 21).
Look for match marks between the sector
shaft and arm. If there aren’t any, scribe a
mark across the bottom face of both parts.
Remove the Pitman arm pinch-bolt and nut,
then remove the arm with a puller.
7 To unbolt the idler arm, first remove the
small cover bolted to the top of the subframe
crossmember. Put a spanner on the bolt, and
remove the nut recessed into the underside of
the subframe crossmember (see illustration).
Check the idler arm rubber bush for wear. If
it’s damaged or worn, renew it.
8 Check each balljoint for excessive play or
stiffness, and for split or deteriorated rubber
dust boots. Renew all worn or damaged
balljoints. The inner and outer track rod ends
on the outer track rods can be renewed
individually; if either balljoint on the centre
track rod is damaged or worn, you must
renew the centre track rod.
Refitting
9 Refitting is the reverse of the removal
procedure, but observe the following points:
a) Realign the match marks on the Pitman
arm and the steering box sector shaft
when reassembling them.
b) If you’re fitting new inner or outer track
rod ends on the outer track rods, position
them so that the match marks made
during dismantling are aligned, and make
sure they are equally spaced on each
side.
c) Position the track rod end balljoint studs
on the outer track rods at an angle of 90°
to each other.
d) Make sure the left and right outer track
rods are equal in length when they are
fitted.
e) Tighten all retaining bolts to the torque
values listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
f) When reassembly of the linkage is
complete, have the front wheel alignment
checked, and if necessary, adjusted.

21 Steering box (5-Series) -
Note: If you find that the steering box is
defective, it is not recommended that you
overhaul it. Because of the special tools
needed to do the job, it is best to let your
dealer service department overhaul it for you
(otherwise, fit a new unit). Removal and
refitting the steering box is outlined here.
1 On 5-Series E28 (“old-shape”) models,
discharge the hydraulic system by depressing
the brake pedal about 20 times.
2 Using a large syringe or hand pump, empty
the power steering fluid reservoir (see Chap-
ter 1).
3 Raise the front of the vehicle and support it
securely on axle stands.
4 Support the front of the engine with a trolley
jack. Place a block of wood between the jack
head and the sump to protect the sump from
damage.
5 Remove the pivot bolts from the inner ends
of the front control arms (see Section 4).
6 Remove the nuts from the left and right
engine mountings (see Chapter 2).
7 Remove the mounting bolts (two on each
side on earlier models, three on each side on
later models) from the subframe crossmember
(see illustration) and remove the subframe.
8 Remove the nuts and bolts that secure the
universal joint shaft to the steering box worm
shaft. Slide the universal joint shaft up and off
the worm shaft. Inspect the universal joint
shaft for wear. If it’s stiff or worn, renew it.
9 Remove the banjo bolts, and disconnect
the hydraulic pressure line and the return line
from the box (see illustration). Plug the ends
of the lines to prevent fluid loss and
contamination. Discard the sealing washers -
new ones should be used when reassembling.
10 Remove the steering box retaining bolts
(see illustrations) and remove the steering
box.
11 If it’s necessary to detach the Pitman arm
from the box sector shaft (to have the box
serviced or to switch the arm to a new or
rebuilt unit), make a match mark across the
two for correct reassembly. Remove the
Pitman arm retaining nut and washer. Use a
puller to withdraw the arm if necessary.
Refitting
12 Refit the Pitman arm by aligning the
match marks made during removal, then
tighten the nut to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications.
13 When fitted the Pitman arm must not have
any measurable endfloat within 100° from the
neutral position. If play exists, have the
following parts checked:
a) Sector shaft and bearings (for wear)
b) Thrust washer and adjuster bolt head (for
wear)
c) Ball nut and worm shaft (for wear)
14 Refit the steering box. Align the mark on
the pinion gear shaft with the mark on the
universal joint shaft, and tighten the steering
box bolts to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
15 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal. Be sure to use new self-locking nuts
on the universal joint shaft, the centre track
rod, the steering box and the crossmember.
Also, use new sealing washers on the
hydraulic line fittings.
16 Refer to Chapter 1 and fill the power
steering reservoir with the recommended
fluid, then bleed the system as described in
Section 23. Check for leakage from the lines
and connections.

2 On 5-Series E28 (“old-shape”) models,
discharge the hydraulic system by depressing
the brake pedal about 20 times before
loosening the hydraulic line fittings.
3 Disconnect the fluid return hose, and drain
the power steering fluid from the reservoir into
a clean container. Disconnect the pressure
line from the pump.
4 If you need to remove the pulley from the
pump, push on the power steering pump
drivebelt by hand to increase the tension, and
unscrew the pulley nuts or bolts.
5 Loosen the power steering pump drivebelt

constant, continue turning the wheel back and
forth until no more bubbles appear in the fluid
in the reservoir.
5 Lower the vehicle to the ground. Run the
engine and again turn the wheels from lock-
to-lock several more times. Recheck the fluid
level. Position the wheels straight-ahead.
24 Steering wheel - 
removal and refitting 1
Warning: If the vehicle is
equipped with an airbag, do not
attempt this procedure. Have it
performed by a dealer service
department or other qualified specialist, as
there is a risk of injury if the airbag is
accidentally triggered.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
2 Using a small screwdriver, prise off the
BMW emblem in the centre of the steering
wheel.
3 Remove the steering wheel nut, and mark
the relationship of the steering wheel hub to
the shaft (see illustration).
4 On all 3-Series models, and on 1986 and
later 5-Series models, turn the ignition key to
the first position to unlock the ignition lock.
5 Remove the steering wheel from the
steering shaft. If the wheel is difficult to
remove from the shaft, use a steering wheel
puller to remove it - don’t hammer on the
shaft.
6 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure
to align the match marks you made on the
steering wheel and the shaft. Tighten the
steering wheel nut to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications.
25 Wheels and tyres - 
general information 1
Note: For more information on care and
maintenance of tyres, refer to Chapter 1.
1 All vehicles covered by this manual are
equipped with steel-belted radial tyres as
original equipment. Use of other types or
sizes of tyres may affect the ride and handling
of the vehicle. Don’t mix different types or
sizes of tyres, as the handling and braking
may be seriously affected. It’s recommended
that tyres be renewed in pairs on the same
axle; if only one new tyre is being fitted, be
sure it’s the same size, structure and tread
design as the other.
2 Because tyre pressure has a substantial
effect on handling and wear, the pressure on
all tyres should be checked at least once a
month or before any extended trips (see
Chapter 1).
3 Wheels must be renewed if they are bent,
heavily dented, leak air, or are otherwise
damaged.
4 Tyre and wheel balance is important in the
overall handling, braking and performance of
the vehicle. Unbalanced wheels can adversely
affect handling and ride characteristics, as
well as tyre life. Whenever a new tyre is fitted,
the tyre and wheel should be balanced.

26 Wheel alignment - 
Wheel alignment refers to the adjustments
made to the wheels so they are in proper
angular relationship to the suspension and the
road. Wheels that are out of proper alignment
not only affect vehicle control, but also
increase tyre wear. The front end angles
normally measured are camber, castor and
toe-in (see illustration). Front wheel toe-in is
adjustable on all models; castor is not
adjustable. Camber is only adjustable by
replacing the strut upper mount with a special
eccentric version. Toe-in is adjustable on the
rear wheels, but only by replacing the trailing
arm outer bushings with special eccentric
bushings.
Setting the proper wheel alignment is a very
exacting process, one in which complicated
and expensive equipment is necessary to
perform the job properly. Because of this, you
should have a technician with the proper
equipment perform these tasks. We will,
however, use this space to give you a basic
idea of what is involved with wheel alignment
so you can better understand the process.
Toe-in is the “turning in” of the wheels. The
purpose of a toe specification is to ensure
parallel rolling of the wheels. In a vehicle with
zero toe-in, the distance between the front
edges of the wheels will be the same as the
distance between the rear edges of the
wheels. The actual amount of toe-in is
normally very small. On the front end, toe-in is
controlled by the track rod end position on the
track rod. On the rear end, toe-in can only be
adjusted by fitting special eccentric bushings
in the trailing arm outer mounting. Incorrect
toe-in will cause the tyres to wear improperly
by making them scrub against the road
surface.
Camber is the “tilting” of the wheels from
vertical, when viewed from one end of the
vehicle. When the wheels tilt out at the top, the
camber is said to be positive (+). When the
wheels tilt in at the top the camber is negative (-
). The amount of tilt is measured in degrees from
vertical, and this measurement is called the
camber angle. This angle affects the amount of
tyre tread which contacts the road, and
compensates for changes in the suspension
geometry when the vehicle is cornering or
travelling over an undulating surface.
Castor is the “tilting” of the front steering
axis from the vertical. A tilt toward the rear at
the top is positive castor; a tilt toward the
front is negative castor. Castor is not
adjustable on the vehicles covered by this
manual.

9•2 Braking system
1 General information
All 3-Series models, and 5-Series E28 (“old-
shape”) models, are equipped with front disc
brakes and either rear drum or rear disc
brakes. 5-Series E34 (“new-shape”) models
have disc brakes front and rear. Front and
rear brakes are self-adjusting on all models.
Some later models are equipped with an Anti-
lock Braking System (ABS); this is described
in Section 2.
Hydraulic system
The hydraulic system consists of two
separate circuits. The master cylinder has
separate reservoirs for the two circuits; in the
event of a leak or failure in one hydraulic
circuit, the other circuit will remain operative.
Brake servo
The vacuum brake servo, utilising engine
manifold vacuum and atmospheric pressure
to provide assistance to the hydraulically
operated brakes, is mounted on the bulkhead
in the engine compartment.
A hydraulic brake servo system is used on
5-Series E28 models. This system uses
hydraulic pressure from the power steering
pump to assist braking.
Handbrake
The handbrake operates the rear brakes,
and is cable-operated via a lever mounted in
the centre console. The handbrake assembly
on rear drum brake models is part of the rear
drum brake assembly, and is self-adjusting.
On rear disc brake models, the handbrake
uses a pair of brake shoes located inside the
centre portion of the rear brake disc, and is
manually-adjusted.
Brake pad wear warning system
The brake pad wear warning system is
linked to a red warning light in the instrument
cluster, which comes on when the brake pads
have worn down to the point at which they
require renewal. DO NOT ignore this reminder.
If you don’t renew the pads shortly after the
brake pad wear warning light comes on, the
brake discs will be damaged.
On some models, the brake pad wear
warning system also includes an early
warning light that comes on only when the
brake pedal is depressed, letting you know in
advance that the pads need to be renewed.
The wear sensor is attached to the brake
pads. The sensor is located at the left front
wheel; on some models, there is another
sensor at the right rear wheel. The wear
sensor is part of a closed circuit. Once the
pads wear down to the point at which they’re
flush with the sensor, the disc grinds away the
side of the sensor facing the disc. Thus, the
wire inside the sensor is broken, and the red
light on the instrument panel comes on.
Always check the sensor(s) when renewing
the pads. If you change the pads before the
warning light comes on, the sensor(s) may still
be good; once the light has come on, renew
the sensor.
Service
After completing any operation involving
dismantling of any part of the brake system,
always test drive the vehicle to check for
proper braking performance before resuming
normal driving. When testing the brakes, try to
select a clean, dry, road with no camber (ie as
flat as possible) and with no other traffic.
Conditions other than these can lead to
inaccurate test results.
Test the brakes at various speeds with both
light and heavy pedal pressure. The vehicle
should stop evenly, without pulling to one side
or the other. Avoid locking the brakes,
because this slides the tyres and diminishes
braking efficiency and control of the vehicle.
Tyres, vehicle load and wheel alignment are
factors which also affect braking
performance.
2 Anti-lock Braking system
(ABS) - general information
The Anti-lock Braking System is designed
to maintain vehicle control, directional stability
and optimum deceleration under severe
braking conditions on most road surfaces. It
does so by monitoring the rotational speed of
each wheel and controlling the brake line
pressure to each wheel during braking. This
prevents the wheels from locking up.
The ABS system has three main
components - the wheel speed sensors, the
electronic control unit, and the hydraulic
control unit. The sensors - one at each wheel
since 1985, but at both front wheels and one
at the rear differential on earlier models - send
a variable voltage signal to the control unit,
which monitors these signals, compares them
to its program information, and determines
whether a wheel is about to lock up. When a
wheel is about to lock up, the control unit
signals the hydraulic unit to reduce hydraulic
pressure (or not increase it further) at that
wheel’s brake caliper. Pressure modulation is
handled by electrically-operated solenoid
valves.
If a problem develops within the system, an
“ABS” warning light will glow on the
dashboard. Sometimes, a visual inspection of
the ABS system can help you locate the
problem. Carefully inspect the ABS wiring
harness. Pay particularly close attention to the
harness and connections near each wheel.
Look for signs of chafing and other damage
caused by incorrectly-routed wires. If a wheel
sensor harness is damaged, the sensor
should be renewed (the harness and sensor
are integral).
Warning: DO NOT try to repair an
ABS wiring harness. The ABS
system is sensitive to even the
smallest changes in resistance. Repairing
the harness could alter resistance values


and cause the system to malfunction. If
the ABS wiring harness is damaged in any
way, it must be renewed.
turned off before unplugging or
re-making any electrical
connections.
Diagnosis and repair
If the dashboard warning light comes on
and stays on while the vehicle is in operation,
the ABS system requires attention. Although
special electronic ABS diagnostic testing
tools are necessary to properly diagnose the
system, you can perform a few preliminary
checks before taking the vehicle to a dealer
service department.
a) Check the brake fluid level in the
reservoir.
b) Verify that the electronic control unit
connectors are securely connected.
c) Check the electrical connectors at the
hydraulic control unit.
d) Check the fuses.
e) Follow the wiring harness to each front
and rear wheel, and verify that all
connections are secure and that the
wiring is undamaged.
If the above preliminary checks do not
rectify the problem, the vehicle should be
diagnosed by a dealer service department.
Due to the complex nature of this system, all
actual repair work must be done by a dealer
service department.
3 Disc brake pads - renewal 2
Warning: Disc brake pads must
be renewed on both front wheels
or both rear wheels at the same
time - NEVER renew the pads on
only one wheel. Also, the dust created by
the brake system may contain asbestos,
which is harmful to your health. Never
blow it out with compressed air, and don’t
inhale any of it. An approved filtering mask
should be worn when working on the
brakes. Do not, under any circumstances,
use petroleum-based solvents to clean
brake parts. Use brake system cleaner
only! When servicing the disc brakes, use
only original-equipment or high-quality
brand-name pads.
Warning: Brake fluid is
poisonous. It is also an effective
paint stripper. Refer to the
warning at the start of Section 16.
Note: This procedure applies to both the front
and rear disc brakes.
1 Remove the cap(s) from the brake fluid
reservoir, and syphon off about two-thirds of
the fluid from the reservoir. Failing to do this
could result in the reservoir overflowing when
the caliper pistons are pressed back into their
bores.
2 Loosen the wheel bolts, raise the front or
rear of the vehicle and support it securely on
axle stands.
3 Remove the front or rear wheels, as
applicable. Work on one brake assembly at a
time, using the assembled brake for reference
if necessary.
4 Inspect the brake disc carefully as outlined
in Section 5. If machining is necessary, follow
the information in that Section to remove the
disc, at which time the pads can be removed
from the calipers as well.
5 Follow the accompanying photos,
beginning with illustration 3.5a, for the pad
removal procedure. Be sure to stay in order,
and read the caption under each illustration.
Note 1: Different types of front calipers are
used on 3 and 5-Series models. Illustrations
3.5a to 3.5e are for the front calipers on 3-
Series models. Illustrations 3.5f to 3.5m are
for the front calipers on 5-Series models.
There’s no photo sequence for rear calipers;
although slightly different in size, they’re
identical in design to the front brake calipers
used on 5-Series models. Note 2: Some
models may have different numbers and types
of anti-squeal shims and other hardware than
what is shown in this Chapter. It’s best to note
how the hardware is fitted on the vehicle
before dismantling, so you can duplicate it on
reassembly.

bore with a C-clamp


6 Be sure to inspect the wear sensor(s) (left
front wheel only, or left front and right rear
wheel). If they’re OK, transfer them from the
old pads to the new ones; if they’re worn by
abrasion, fit new sensors on the new pads.
7 To fit the new pads, reverse the removal
procedure. When refitting the caliper, be sure
to tighten the mounting bolts to the torque
listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
Warning: Check and if necessary
renew the mounting bolts on 3-
Series models whenever they are
removed.  If in doubt, use new
bolts.
8 After the job is completed, firmly depress
the brake pedal a few times, to bring the pads
into contact with the discs. The pedal should
be at normal height above the floor, and firm.
Check the level of the brake fluid, adding
some if necessary. Check carefully for leaks,
and check the operation of the brakes before
returning the vehicle to normal service.
9 Avoid heavy braking as far as possible for
the first hundred miles or so until the new
pads have bedded in.
4 Disc brake caliper - removal,
overhaul and refitting 4
Warning: Dust created by the
brake system may contain
asbestos, which is harmful to
your health. Never blow it out
with compressed air, and don’t inhale any
of it. An approved filtering mask should be
worn when working on the brakes. Do not,
under any circumstances, use petroleum-
based solvents to clean brake parts. Use
brake system cleaner only!
Warning: Brake fluid is
poisonous. It is also an effective
paint stripper. Refer to the
warning at the start of Section 16.
Note: If an overhaul is indicated (usually
because of fluid leakage), explore all options
before beginning the job. Overhauled calipers
may be available on an exchange basis, which
makes this job quite easy. If you decide to
overhaul the calipers, make sure that an
overhaul kit is available before proceeding.
Always overhaul the calipers in pairs - never
overhaul just one of them.
Removal
1 Loosen the wheel bolts, raise the front or
rear of the vehicle, and place it securely on
axle stands. Remove the wheel.
2 If you’re just removing the caliper for
access to other components, it isn’t
necessary to detach the brake line. If you’re
removing the caliper for overhaul, disconnect
the brake line from the caliper, for preference
using a split ring (“brake”) spanner to protect
the fitting. Plug the line, to keep contaminants
out of the brake system and to prevent losing
brake fluid unnecessarily.
3 Refer to Section 3 for the front or rear
caliper removal procedure - it’s part of the
brake pad renewal procedure. Note: The rear
caliper is similar in design to the front caliper
on 5-series models.
Overhaul
4 On all calipers except the front calipers on
3-Series models, remove the circlip for the
dust seal (see illustration), then remove the
dust boot (see illustration). Before you
remove the piston, place a block of wood
between the piston and caliper to prevent
damage as it is removed.
5 To remove the piston from the caliper,
apply compressed air to the brake fluid hose
connection on the caliper body (see

illustration). Use only low pressure, such as
that produced by a foot pump, to ease the
piston out of its bore.
Warning: Be careful not to place
your fingers between the piston
and the caliper, as the piston
may come out with some force. If
you’re working on a front caliper of a 3-
Series model, remove the dust boot.
6 Inspect the mating surfaces of the piston
and caliper bore wall. If there is any scoring,
rust, pitting or bright areas, renew the
complete caliper unit.
7 If these components are in good condition,
remove the piston seal from the caliper bore
using a wooden or plastic tool (see
illustration). Metal tools may damage the
cylinder bore.
8 Remove the caliper guide pins or bolts and
remove the rubber dust boots.
9 Wash all the components using methylated
spirit or brake system cleaner.
10 Using the correct overhaul kit for your
vehicle, reassemble the caliper as follows.
11 Dip the new rubber seal in clean brake
fluid, and refit it in the lower groove in the
caliper bore, making sure it isn’t twisted.
12 On all calipers except the front calipers of
3-Series models, coat the walls of the caliper
bore and the piston with clean brake fluid, and
refit the piston at this time. Do not force the
piston into the bore, but make sure that it is
squarely in place, then apply firm (but not
excessive) pressure to refit it. Fit the new
rubber dust boot and the retaining ring.
13 On the front calipers of 3-Series models,
coat the piston with clean brake fluid, and
stretch the new dust boot over the bottom of
the piston. Hold the piston over the caliper
bore, and insert the rubber flange of the dust
boot into the upper groove in the bore. Start
with the furthest side from you, and work your
way around towards the front until it is
completely seated. Push the piston into the
caliper bore until it is bottomed in the bore,
then seat the top of the dust boot in the
groove in the piston.
14 Lubricate the sliding surfaces of the guide
pins or bolts with silicone-based grease
(usually supplied in the kit), and push them
into the caliper. Refit the dust boots.
Refitting
15 Refit the caliper by reversing the removal
procedure (see Section 3).
Warning: Check and if necessary
renew the mounting bolts on 3-
Series models whenever they are
removed. If in doubt, use new bolts.
16 If the hose was disconnected from the
caliper, bleed the brake system (see Sec-
tion 16).
5 Brake disc - inspection,
removal and refitting 2
Note: This procedure applies to both the front
and rear brake discs. Brake discs should
always be renewed or refinished in pairs (both
front or both rear discs) even if only one is
damaged or defective.

and support it securely on axle stands.
Remove the wheel, and refit three bolts to
hold the disc in place. If the rear brake disc is
being worked on, release the handbrake.
2 Remove the brake caliper as outlined in
Section 4. It is not necessary to disconnect
the brake hose. After removing the caliper,
suspend it out of the way with a piece of wire.
Remove the caliper mounting bracket (see
illustration).
3 Inspect the disc surface for scoring, cracks
or other damage. Light scratches and shallow
grooves are normal after use, and are not
usually detrimental to brake operation, but
deep scoring requires disc removal and
renewal, or (if possible) refinishing by a
specialist. If a disc is cracked it must be
renewed. Be sure to check both sides of the
disc (see illustration). If severe vibration has
been noticed during application of the brakes,
the discs may be warped (excessive run-out).
If the vehicle is equipped with the Anti-lock
Braking System (ABS), do not confuse
vibration caused by warped discs with normal
operation of the ABS. It is quite normal for
some vibration to be felt through the pedal
when the system is working.
4 To check disc run-out, place a dial indicator
at a point about 13 mm from the outer edge of
the disc (see illustration). Set the indicator to
zero, and rotate the disc. The indicator
reading should not exceed the specified
allowable run-out limit. If it does (and if the
run-out is not due to wheel bearing wear), the
disc should be renewed or (if possible)
refinished by a specialist. Note: It is
recommended that the discs be resurfaced
regardless of the dial indicator reading, as this
will impart a smooth finish and ensure a
perfectly flat surface, eliminating any vibration
felt through the brake pedal or other
undesirable symptoms related to questionable
discs. At the very least, if you elect not to have
the discs resurfaced, remove the glazing from
the surface with emery cloth or sandpaper,
using a swirling motion (see illustration).
5 It is absolutely critical that the disc not be
machined to a thickness less than that
specified. The minimum wear (or discard)
thickness is stamped into the hub of the disc.
The disc thickness can be checked with a
micrometer (see illustration).
Removal
6 Remove the disc retaining screw (see
illustration) and remove the disc from the hub
(see illustration). If the disc is stuck to the
hub, spray a generous amount of penetrating
oil onto the area between the hub and the disc
(see illustration) and allow a few minutes for
it to loosen the rust between the two
components. If a rear disc still sticks, insert a
thin, flat-bladed screwdriver through the hub
flange, rotate the starwheel on the handbrake

7 Ensure that the disc is completely clean
before refitting. If penetrating oil was used to
remove the disc, make sure that no trace of
this is present. Place the disc on the hub, and
refit the disc retaining screw. Tighten the
screw securely.
8 Refit the caliper mounting bracket (if
removed), brake pads and caliper (see
Sections 3 and 4). Tighten all fasteners to the
torques listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
9 Refit the wheel, then lower the vehicle to
the ground. Depress the brake pedal a few
times to bring the brake pads into contact
with the disc.
10 Adjust the handbrake shoes, if necessary
(Section 11).
11 Check the operation of the brakes
carefully before returning the vehicle to
normal service.
6 Drum brake shoes - renewal 2
Warning: Brake shoes must be
renewed on both wheels at the
same time - never renew the
shoes on only one wheel. Also,
the dust created by the brake system may
contain asbestos, which is harmful to your
health. Never blow it out with compressed
air, and don’t inhale any of it. Always wear
an approved filtering mask when servicing
the brake system. Do not, under any
circumstances, use petroleum-based
solvents to clean brake parts. Use brake
system cleaner only.
Caution: Whenever the brake
shoes are renewed, new return
and hold-down springs and new
automatic adjuster thermo-clips
should also be fitted. Due to the
continuous heating/cooling cycle to which
the springs are subjected, they may lose
their tension over a period of time,
allowing the shoes to drag on the drum,
and wear at a much faster rate than
normal. When fitting new brake shoes, use
only original-equipment or high-quality
brand name parts.
Note 1: All four rear brake shoes must be
renewed at the same time, but to avoid mixing
up parts, work on only one brake assembly at
a time. Some rear brake components are
different for left and right-hand sides, so don’t
mix them up.
Note 2: If the wheel cylinder is found to be
leaking or otherwise defective, renew it after
removing the brake shoes. This is simply a
matter of disconnecting the hydraulic line and
unbolting the cylinder from the backplate.
Attempting to overhaul a leaking cylinder is
unlikely to be satisfactory, even if spare parts
are available.
1 Chock the front wheels, then loosen the
rear wheel bolts, raise the rear of the vehicle
and place it securely on axle stands. Remove
the rear wheels and release the handbrake.
2 Remove the drum retaining screw (see
illustration) and remove the drum. If the drum
is stuck to the hub, spray the area between
the hub and the drum with penetrating oil
(see illustration). If the drum still won’t come
off, the shoes have probably worn ridges into
the drum, and will have to be retracted. Insert
a narrow flat-bladed screwdriver through one
of the holes in the hub flange (see
illustration) and back off the adjuster wheel
until the drum can be removed.
3 Inspect the drum for cracks, score marks,
deep scratches and hard spots, which will
appear as small discoloured areas. If the hard
spots can’t be removed with emery cloth or if
any of the other conditions exist, the drum must
be taken to a specialist to have the drum
resurfaced. Note: Professionals recommend
resurfacing the drums whenever a brake job is
done. Resurfacing will eliminate the possibility
of out-of-round drums. If the drums are worn so
much that they can’t be resurfaced without
exceeding the maximum allowable diameter
(which is cast into the drum) (see illustration),
then new ones will be required. At the very least,
if you elect not to have the drums resurfaced,
remove the glazing from the surface with emery
cloth or sandpaper, using a swirling motion.

9
If the front disc is stuck, on
some discs it is possible to
thread two or three bolts into
the holes provided and
tighten them. Alternate between the
bolts, turning them a couple of turns at
a time, until the disc is free.


4 Unhook and remove the lower return spring
5 Unhook and remove the upper return spring
6 Remove the front and rear brake shoe hold-
8 Remove the adjuster assembly (see
illustration). Clean the adjuster and make
sure that the adjuster wheel moves freely on
the threads. It is recommended that the
thermo-clip (the spring clip next to the
adjuster wheel) be renewed whenever new
shoes are fitted. Turn the adjuster wheel so
that the assembly is at its shortest position
ready for refitting.
9 Disconnect the handbrake cable from the
handbrake lever, and remove the rear shoe
(see illustration).
10 Refitting is basically the reverse of
removal, but note the following points.
11 Apply a smear of high-temperature brake
grease to the backing plate (see illustration).
Be careful not to get grease onto the 
9•8 Braking system
6.11  Before you fit the new shoes, apply
some high-temperature brake grease to
the friction surfaces where the inner edge
of the shoe slides on the brake backing
plate - when you refit the automatic
adjuster mechanism, make sure each end
engages properly with its respective notch
in the brake shoe
6.9  To disconnect the handbrake cable
from the handbrake lever, pull on the plug
at the end of the cable, and detach the
cable from the bracket on the upper end of

12 Make sure the adjuster assembly is
properly engaged with its respective notch in

13 When refitting the automatic adjustment
mechanism, fit the lever on the shoe first (see
illustration), then hook the lower end of the
spring onto the lever and the upper end into
its hole in the front shoe (see illustration).
14 When you’re done, the brake assembly
should look like this (see illustration). Now
proceed to the other brake.
15 When you’re done with both brakes, refit
the brake drums. 
16 If the wheel cylinder was renewed (see
Note 2), bleed the hydraulic system as
described in Section 16.
17 Depress the brake pedal repeatedly to
actuate the self-adjusting mechanism. A
clicking sound will be heard from the brake
drums as the adjusters take up the slack.
18 Check the handbrake adjustment (Sec-
tion 11).
19 Refit the wheels and bolts. Lower the
vehicle to the ground, and tighten the wheel
bolts to the torque listed in the Chapter 1
Specifications. Check the operation of the
brakes carefully before driving the vehicle in
traffic.
7 Master cylinder - 
removal and refitting 3
Warning: Brake fluid is
poisonous. It is also an effective
paint stripper. Refer to the
warning at the start of Section 16.
Note: Although master cylinder parts and
overhaul kits are available for most models, we
recommend fitting a new or overhauled
master cylinder complete. It will take you more
time to overhaul the master cylinder than to
renew it, and you can’t even determine
whether the master cylinder is in good enough
condition to overhaul it until you have
dismantled it. You may very well find that it
can’t be overhauled because of its internal
condition.
Removal
1 The master cylinder is connected to the
brake vacuum servo, and both are attached to
the bulkhead, located on the left-hand side of
the engine compartment (see illustration).
2 Remove as much fluid as you can from the
reservoir with a syringe.
3 Place rags under the line fittings, and
prepare caps or plastic bags to cover the
ends of the lines once they are disconnected.
Caution: Brake fluid will damage
paint. Cover all body parts, and
be careful not to spill fluid during
this procedure.
4 Loosen the union nuts at the ends of the
brake lines where they enter the master
cylinder. To prevent rounding off the flats on
these nuts, a split ring (“brake”) spanner,
which wraps around the nut, should be used.
5 Pull the brake lines away from the master
cylinder slightly, and plug the ends to prevent
dirt contamination and further fluid loss.
6 Disconnect any electrical connectors at the
master cylinder, then remove the nuts
attaching the master cylinder to the brake
servo. Pull the master cylinder off the studs,
and lift it out of the engine compartment.
Again, be careful not to spill fluid as this is
done. Discard the old O-ring (see illustration)
between the master cylinder and the servo
unit.
Warning: The O-ring should
always be renewed. A faulty O-
ring can cause a vacuum leak,
which can reduce braking performance
and cause an erratic idle.
Bleeding procedure
7 Before fitting a new or overhauled master
cylinder, it should be bled on the bench.
Because it will be necessary to apply pressure
to the master cylinder piston and, at the same
time, control flow from the brake line outlets, it
is recommended that the master cylinder be
mounted in a vice. Use a vice with protected
jaws, and don’t clamp the vice too tightly, or
the master cylinder body might crack.
8 Insert threaded plugs into the brake line
outlet holes. Tighten them down so that there
will be no air leakage past them, but not so
tight that they cannot be easily loosened.
9 Fill the reservoir with brake fluid of the
recommended type (see “Lubricants, fluids
and capacities” in Chapter 1).
10 Remove one plug, and push the piston
assembly into the master cylinder bore to

expel the air from the master cylinder. A large
Phillips screwdriver can be used to push on
the piston assembly.
11 To prevent air from being drawn back into
the master cylinder, the plug must be refitted
and tightened down before releasing the
pressure on the piston assembly.
12 Repeat the procedure until brake fluid free
of air bubbles is expelled from the brake line
outlet hole. Repeat the procedure with the
other outlet hole and plug. Be sure to keep the
master cylinder reservoir filled with brake
fluid, to prevent the introduction of air into the
system.
13 High pressure is not involved in the bench
bleeding procedure, so the plugs described
above need not be refitted each time the
piston is released, if wished. Instead, before
releasing the piston, simply put your finger
tightly over the hole to keep air from being
drawn back into the master cylinder. Wait
several seconds for brake fluid to be drawn
from the reservoir into the piston bore, then
depress the piston again, removing your
finger as brake fluid is expelled. Be sure to put
your finger back over the hole each time
before releasing the piston, and when the
bleeding procedure is complete for that outlet,
refit the plug and tighten it up before going on
to the other port.
Refitting
14 Refit the master cylinder (together with a
new O-ring) over the studs on the brake servo,
and tighten the mounting nuts only finger-tight
at this time.
15 Thread the brake line fittings into the
master cylinder. Since the master cylinder is
still a bit loose, it can be moved slightly in
order for the fittings to thread in easily. Do not
strip the threads as the fittings are tightened.
16 Tighten the brake fittings securely, and
the mounting nuts to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications.
17 Fill the master cylinder reservoir with fluid,
then bleed the master cylinder (only if the
cylinder has not already been bled) and the
brake system as described in Section 16.
18 To bleed the cylinder on the vehicle, have
an assistant pump the brake pedal several
times and then hold the pedal to the floor.
Loosen the fitting nut to allow air and fluid to
escape, then tighten the nut. Repeat this
procedure on both fittings until the fluid is
clear of air bubbles. Test the operation of the
brake system carefully before returning the
vehicle to normal service.
8 Brake vacuum servo - 
check, removal and refitting 3
Operating check
1 Depress the brake pedal several times with
the engine off, until there is no change in the
pedal travel.
2 Depress and hold the pedal, then start the
engine. If the pedal goes down slightly,
operation is normal.
Airtightness check
3 Start the engine, and turn it off after one or
two minutes. Depress the brake pedal several
times slowly. If the pedal goes down further
the first time but gradually rises after the
second or third depression, the servo is
airtight.
4 Depress the brake pedal while the engine is
running, then stop the engine with the pedal
depressed. If there is no change in the pedal
travel after holding the pedal for 30 seconds,
the servo is airtight.
Removal and refitting
5 Dismantling the vacuum servo requires
special tools, and cannot be performed by the
home mechanic. If a problem develops, it is
recommended that a new unit be fitted.
6 Remove the master cylinder as described in
Section 7.
7 Disconnect the vacuum hose from the
brake servo.
8 Working in the passenger compartment,
remove the glovebox and lower left-hand trim
panels.
9 Remove the clip and clevis pin to
disconnect the pushrod from the cross-shaft
lever (right-hand-drive models) or brake pedal
(left-hand-drive models) (see illustration). On
left-hand-drive models, also disconnect the
brake pedal return spring.
10 Remove the four mounting nuts (see
illustration) and withdraw the servo unit from
the engine compartment.
11 Inspect the small foam filter (see
illustration) inside the rubber boot on the
pushrod. If the filter is clogged, it may affect
the servo’s performance. To clean the filter,
wash it in a mild soapy solution. If it’s still
dirty, renew it.
12 Refitting is the reverse of the removal
procedure. Tighten the brake servo mounting
nuts to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications. Before you slide the boot into
place over the servo pushrod air filter, make
sure the notches in the filter offset the notches
in the damper by 180 degrees.
13 On 3-Series models, adjust the basic
setting of the pushrod’s threaded clevis until
the dimension is correct (see illustration).
When the basic setting is correct, tighten the
locknut, then adjust the brake pedal travel and

dimension is measured at the pedal on the
right-hand side.
14 On 5-Series models, adjust the brake
pedal height and the stop-light switch (see
Section 13).
15 Refit the master cylinder (see Section 7)
and attach the vacuum hose.

9 Hydraulic brake servo -
description, removal and
refitting
3
Warning: Brake fluid is
poisonous. It is also an effective
paint stripper. Refer to the
warning at the start of Section 16.
Description
1 On 5-Series E28 (“old-shape”) models, a
hydraulic brake servo system is fitted. The
servo unit, located between the brake pedal
(left-hand-drive) or cross-shaft lever (right-
hand-drive) and the master cylinder, is
operated by hydraulic pressure generated by
the power steering pump. When the engine is
running, the power steering pump supplies
hydraulic pressure to a power flow regulator/
accumulator. The regulator/accumulator
stores and regulates the pressure to the
hydraulic brake servo. When you press the
brake pedal, the pressure in the servo helps
actuate the master cylinder, reducing pedal
effort.
2 The hydraulic brake servo cannot be
overhauled; if it fails, a new one must be fitted.
Testing the system requires special tools, so
even fault diagnosis is beyond the scope of
the home mechanic. If the system fails, take it
to a dealer service department or other
qualified garage for repairs.
Removal and refitting
3 With the engine off, discharge the hydraulic
accumulator by depressing the brake pedal
20 times or more.
4 Remove the master cylinder (see Section 7).
5 Clean the area around the return and
supply line fittings, then disconnect them.
Plug the lines, to prevent dirt from entering the
system, and to prevent further fluid loss.
Caution: Even a particle of dirt
can damage the servo, so be
extremely careful to prevent dirt
from entering the system while
the lines are disconnected.
6 Working from inside the passenger
compartment, remove the lower left trim
panels above the brake pedal (left-hand-drive
models) or glovebox and trim (right-hand-
drive models). On left-hand-drive models, also
disconnect the pedal return spring.
7 Prise off the retaining clip, and disconnect
the pushrod from the brake pedal (see
illustration 8.9) or cross-shaft lever.
8 Remove the four mounting nuts and
remove the brake servo (see illus-
tration 8.10).
9 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Tighten
the hydraulic lines to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. Note: Don’t try to
tighten these fittings without a torque wrench.
If they’re loose, they can leak, which can affect
system operation; if they’re tight, they can be
damaged, and they’ll also leak. You’ll need a
crowfoot-type split ring (“brake”) attachment
for your torque wrench to tighten the fittings
properly. 
10 When you’re done, bleed the brake
hydraulic system (Section 16) and adjust the
brake pedal travel and the stop-light switch
(see Section 13).
10 Handbrake cable(s) - renewal 2
1 Peel back the boot at the base of the
handbrake lever, and remove the handbrake
cable adjusting nut (see illustration) which
also secures the cable to the handbrake lever.
There are two cables - one for each rear wheel
- and a nut for each cable. On some models, it
may be necessary to remove the centre
console completely for access.
2 Raise the vehicle and support it securely on
axle stands.
3 Remove the rear brake drum (see Section 6)
or rear brake disc (see Section 5).
4 On rear drum models, unhook the
handbrake cable from the lever on the rear
brake shoe (see Section 6). On rear disc
models, remove the handbrake shoes and the
actuator (see Section 12) and unhook the
handbrake cable from the actuator (see
illustrations). 
5 On rear drum models, pull the cable and
cable conduit (tube) out of the back of the
brake backplate, then detach the cable
conduit from the cable clips on the back of
the trailing arm (it’s easier to pull out the old
cable, and fit the new cable, with the conduit
straight instead of curved). On rear disc
models, it’s unnecessary to detach the cable
conduit from the brake backplate, but it’s a
good idea to detach the conduit from the clips
and guides securing it to the trailing arm, to
take some of the bend out of the conduit.
6 Working from the wheel end of the cable
conduit, pull the cable out of the conduit (see
illustration).
7 Lubricate the new cable with multi-purpose
grease, then insert it into the cable conduit

and push it through until the forward end
comes out at the handbrake lever.
8 Insert the cable conduit through the
backplate, and attach the rear end of the
cable to the handbrake lever (rear drum
models) or the actuator (rear disc models).
Make sure you don’t kink the cable while
connecting it. 
9 Refit the cable conduit to the clips on the
back of the trailing arm.
10 On rear drum models, refit the brake
shoes and drum (see Section 6). On rear disc
models, refit the handbrake shoes and
actuator (see Section 12) and the rear brake
disc (see Section 5).
11 Lower the vehicle, and refit the adjusting
nut at the handbrake lever. Adjust the
handbrake cable (see Section 11) and refit the
handbrake lever boot.
11 Handbrake - adjustment 2
Rear drum brake models
Note: Adjustment of the handbrake cable(s)
on models with rear drum brakes should only
be necessary when you renew a cable or
detach if from the rear brake assembly for
some reason. Failure of the handbrake system
to hold the vehicle usually indicates worn
brake shoes or a faulty self-adjusting
mechanism.
1 Raise the rear of the vehicle, and place it
securely on axle stands.
2 Fully release the handbrake lever, then
apply the brakes firmly several times with the
footbrake pedal.
3 Pull the handbrake lever up five clicks.
4 Tighten or loosen the adjusting nuts by
equal amounts until the rear brake shoes just
begin to drag on the brake drum. You should
feel the same amount of resistance at both
wheels when you rotate them.
5 Release the handbrake lever, and verify that
the wheels rotate freely. If they don’t, re-
adjust them.
Rear disc brake models
Note: The handbrake system is not self-
adjusting on models with rear disc brakes. The
handbrake therefore requires periodic
adjustment to compensate for wear. It should
also be adjusted anytime either cable, brake
disc or handbrake assembly is renewed or
removed for some reason.
6 Slowly apply the handbrake, and count the
number of clicks at the lever. If the lever can
be pulled up further than the eighth click,
adjust the handbrake cable as follows.
7 Peel back the handbrake lever boot, and
loosen the cable adjusting nut (see
illustration 10.1). On some models, it may be
necessary to remove the centre console
completely for access.
8 Loosen a single bolt in each rear wheel.
Raise the vehicle and place it securely on axle
stands.
9 Remove the bolt you loosened in each rear
wheel. Turn the wheel until, using a torch, you
can see the adjuster starwheel through the
bolt hole.
10 Turn the adjuster - clockwise to expand
the shoes, anti-clockwise to retract them -
until the brake shoes just contact the brake
drum (see illustration 5.6d). Back off the
brake shoes so the wheel spins freely (three to
four teeth on the adjuster). Note: If the
adjuster starwheel is hard to turn, remove the
wheel and brake disc, lubricate the adjuster
wheel, and try again.
11 With the disc fitted, apply the handbrake
three times to stretch and seat the cables,
then slowly pull up on the handbrake lever to
the fifth click. Tighten the cable adjusting nuts
by equal amounts until the rear brake shoes
just touch the brake drum. Verify that both
wheels have the same amount of resistance.
12 Release the handbrake, and verify that
both rear wheels rotate freely.
13 Tighten the wheel bolts to the torque
listed in Chapter 1 Specifications.
12 Handbrake assembly -
check, removal and refitting 2
Warning: The handbrake linings
on rear disc brake models may
be manufactured of asbestos-
based material. Refer to the
warning at the start of Section 6. When
servicing these components, do not create
dust by grinding or sanding the linings.
1 The handbrake system should be checked
regularly. With the vehicle parked on a hill,
apply the handbrake, select neutral, and
check that the handbrake alone will hold the
vehicle when the footbrake is released (be
sure to stay in the vehicle during this check).
However, every 2 years (or whenever a fault is
suspected), the assembly itself should be
inspected.
2 With the vehicle raised and supported on
axle stands, remove the rear wheels.
3 On rear brake drum models, refer to
Chapter 1; checking the thickness of the
brake shoes is a routine maintenance
procedure.
4 On rear disc brake models, remove the rear
discs as outlined in Section 5. Support the
caliper assemblies with a coat hanger or
heavy wire; do not disconnect the brake line
from the caliper.
5 With the disc removed, the handbrake
components are visible, and can be inspected
for wear and damage. The linings should last
the life of the vehicle. However, they can wear
down if the handbrake system has been
improperly adjusted, or if the handbrake is
regularly used to stop the vehicle. There is no
minimum thickness specification for the
handbrake shoes, but as a rule of thumb, if
the shoe material is less than 1.5 mm thick,
you should renew them. Also check the
springs and adjuster mechanism and inspect
the drum for deep scratches and other
damage.
Removal and refitting
Note: The following procedure applies only to
models with rear disc brakes. The handbrake
system on models with rear drum brakes is an
integral part of the rear brake assembly (see
Section 6).
6 Loosen the rear wheel bolts, raise the rear
of the vehicle and place it securely on axle
stands. Remove the rear wheels. Remove the
brake discs (see Section 5). Work on only one
side at a time, so you can use the other side
as a reference during reassembly, and to
avoid mixing up parts.
7 Remove the shoe return and hold-down
springs (see illustrations).
8 Remove the shoes (see illustration).
9 Refitting is the reverse of removal. When
you’re done, the actuator should be properly
seated between the two shoes as shown (see
illustration).
10 After refitting the brake disc, adjust the
handbrake shoes. Temporarily refit two wheel
bolts, turn the adjuster (see illustration 5.6d)
and expand the shoes until the disc locks,

spring (diagonal cutting pliers are being
used here because they grip the spring
well, but care must be taken not to cut or
nick the spring)


then back off the adjuster until the shoes
don’t drag (see Section 11). Refit the wheel
bolts, and tighten them to the torque given in
13 Brake pedal - adjustment 1
Note: You should always adjust brake pedal
height after the master cylinder or brake servo
has been removed or renewed. You should
also adjust the stop-light switch (see Sec-
tion 14).
1 Measure the distance between the lower
edge of the brake pedal footpad (ie the edge
furthest from the bulkhead) and the bulkhead
(see illustration), and compare your
measurement with the dimension listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. If it’s not as listed,
loosen the locknut on the pushrod, and rotate
the pushrod while holding the clevis stationary
until the distance is correct. Note: On right-
hand-drive models, the adjustment is carried
out at the left-hand side of the cross-shaft,
after removing the glovebox, but the
dimension is still measured at the pedal.
14 Stop-light switch - 
check and adjustment 1
Note: The stop-light switch should be
checked and, if necessary, adjusted after the
master cylinder or brake servo has been
removed or renewed.
1 The stop-light switch is located on a
bracket at the top of the brake pedal. The
switch activates the brake lights whenever the
pedal is depressed.
2 With the brake pedal in the rest position,
measure the distance between the switch
contact point on the brake pedal and the
switch housing (see illustration) and
compare your measurement with dimension A
listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
3 If your measurement is outside the
indicated dimension, disconnect the wires
from the switch. Loosen the locknuts, screw
the switch in or out until the plunger
dimension is correct, and retighten the
locknuts. Reconnect the wires and check for
correct operation.
15 Brake hoses and lines -
inspection and renewal 4
Warning: Brake fluid is
poisonous. It is also an effective
paint stripper. Refer to the
warning at the start of Section 16.
Inspection
1 At the intervals specified in Chapter 1, the
brake hoses and lines should be inspected.
With the vehicle raised and placed securely
on axle stands, the flexible hoses should be
checked for cracks, chafing of the outer
cover, leaks, blisters and other damage.
These are important and vulnerable parts of
the brake system, and inspection should be
thorough. The metal pipes should be checked
for excessive pitting and corrosion. If a hose
or pipe exhibits any of the conditions
described, renew it. 
Flexible hose renewal
2 Clean all dirt away from the ends of the
hose. Have ready a suitable container to catch
spilled brake fluid when the hose is
disconnected.
3 To disconnect the hose at the chassis end,
use a spanner to hold the hex-shaped fitting
on the end of the flexible hose, and loosen the
nut on the metal brake line (see illustration).
If the nut is stuck, soak it with penetrating oil.
After the hose is disconnected from the metal
line, remove the spring clip from the bracket
and detach the hose from the bracket.
4 To detach the flexible hose from the caliper,

simply unscrew it. Plug the open fitting in the
caliper if the hose is removed for any length of
time, to prevent dirt ingress.
5 Refitting is the reverse of the removal
procedure. Make sure the brackets are in
good condition and the locknuts are securely
tightened. Renew the spring clips if they don’t
fit tightly.
6 Carefully check to make sure the
suspension and steering components do not
make contact with the hoses. Have an
assistant turn the steering wheel from lock-to-
lock during inspection.
7 Bleed the brake system as described in
Section 16.
Metal brake line renewal
8 When renewing brake lines, use genuine
parts only - preferably from a BMW dealer.
9 Genuine BMW brake lines are supplied
straight. You’ll need a pipe-bending tool to
bend them to the proper shape.
10 First, remove the line you intend to renew,
lay it on a clean workbench and measure it
carefully. Obtain a new line of the same
length, and bend it to match the pattern of the
old line.
Warning: Do not crimp or
damage the line. No bend should
have a smaller radius than 
14 mm. Make sure the protective
coating on the new line is undamaged at
the bends.
11 When fitting the new line, make sure it’s
well supported by the brackets, that the
routing matches the original, and that there’s
plenty of clearance between movable
components or those components which will
become hot.
12 After refitting, check the master cylinder
fluid level, and add fluid as necessary. Bleed
the brake system as outlined in Section 16,
and test the brakes carefully before driving the
vehicle. Be sure there are no leaks.
16 Brake hydraulic system -
bleeding 3
Warning: Wear eye protection
when bleeding the brake system.
If the fluid comes in contact with
your eyes, immediately rinse
them with water, and seek medical
attention. Most types of brake fluid are
highly flammable, and may ignite if spilled
onto hot engine components, for example.
In this respect, brake fluid should be
treated with as much care as if it were
petrol. When topping-up or renewing the
fluid, always use the recommended type,
and ensure that it comes from a freshly-
opened sealed container. Never re-use old
brake fluid bled from the system, and don’t
top-up with fluid which has been standing
open for a long time, as it is potentially
dangerous to do so. 
Note: Bleeding the hydraulic system is
necessary to remove any air which has
entered the system during removal and
refitting of a hose, line, caliper or master
cylinder.
1 It will probably be necessary to bleed the
system at all four brakes if air has entered the
system due to low fluid level, or if the brake
lines have been disconnected at the master
cylinder.
2 If a brake line was disconnected at only one
wheel, then only that caliper or wheel cylinder
need be bled.
3 If a brake line is disconnected at a fitting
located between the master cylinder and any
of the brakes, that part of the system served
by the disconnected line must be bled.
4 Bleed the right rear, the left rear, the right
front and the left front brake, in that order,
when the entire system is involved.
5 Remove any residual vacuum from the
brake servo by applying the brakes about 30
times with the engine off. This will also relieve
any pressure in the anti-lock brake system
(where applicable).
6 Remove the master cylinder reservoir
cover, and fill the reservoir with brake fluid.
Refit the cover. Note: Check the fluid level
often during the bleeding operation, and add
fluid as necessary to prevent the fluid level
from falling low enough to allow air into the
master cylinder.
7 Have an assistant on hand, an empty clear
plastic container, and a length of clear plastic
or vinyl tubing to fit over the bleed screws.
Alternatively, a “one-man” bleeding kit can be
used. A “one-man” kit usually contains a tube
or bottle with a one-way valve incorporated -
in this way, the pedal can be pumped as
normal, but air is not drawn back into the
system when the pedal is released. If a one-
man kit is used, follow the instructions
provided with it; similarly with pressure
bleeding kits. In any case, you will also need a
supply of new brake fluid of the
recommended type, and a spanner for the
bleed screw.
8 Beginning at the right rear wheel, loosen the
bleed screw slightly, then tighten it to a point
where it is tight but can still be loosened
quickly and easily.
9 Place one end of the tubing over the bleed
nipple, and submerge the other end in brake
fluid in the container (see illustration).
10 Have the assistant pump the brakes a few
times, then hold the pedal firmly depressed.
Note: If the vehicle is equipped with ABS,
have the assistant pump the pedal at least 12
times.
11 While the pedal is held depressed, open
the bleed screw just enough to allow a flow of
fluid to leave the caliper or wheel cylinder.
Your assistant should press the brake pedal
smoothly to the floor, and hold it there. Watch
for air bubbles coming out of the submerged
end of the tube. When the fluid flow slows
after a couple of seconds, close the screw
and have your assistant release the pedal.
12 Repeat paragraphs 10 and 11 until no
more air is seen leaving the tube, then tighten
the bleed screw and proceed to the left rear
wheel, the right front wheel and the left front
wheel, in that order, and perform the same
procedure. Be sure to check the fluid in the
master cylinder reservoir frequently.
Warning: Never re-use old brake
fluid. It absorbs moisture from
the atmosphere, which can allow
the fluid to boil and render the
brakes inoperative.
13 Refill the master cylinder with fluid at the
end of the operation.
14 Check the operation of the brakes. The
pedal should feel solid when depressed, with
no sponginess. If necessary, repeat the entire
process. Do not operate the vehicle if you are
in doubt about the effectiveness of the brake
system.

1 General information
To prevent pollution of the atmosphere
from incomplete combustion or evaporation
of the fuel, and to maintain good driveability
and fuel economy, a number of emission
control systems are used on these vehicles.
Not all of these systems are fitted to all
models, but they include the following:
Catalytic converter
Evaporative emission control (EVAP) system
Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system
Electronic engine management
The Sections in this Chapter include
general descriptions and checking
procedures within the scope of the home
mechanic, as well as component renewal
procedures (when possible) for each of the
systems listed above.
Before assuming that an emissions control
system is malfunctioning, check the fuel and
ignition systems carefully. The diagnosis of
some emission control devices requires
specialised tools, equipment and training. If
checking and servicing become too difficult,
or if a procedure is beyond your ability,
consult a dealer service department or other
specialist.
This doesn’t mean, however, that emission
control systems are particularly difficult to
maintain and repair. You can quickly and
easily perform many checks, and do most of
the regular maintenance at home with
common tune-up and hand tools. 
Pay close attention to any special
precautions outlined in this Chapter. It should
be noted that the illustrations of the various
systems may not exactly match the system
fitted on your vehicle because of 
changes made by the manufacturer during
production.
2 Motronic engine management
system self-diagnosis -
general information
The Motronic engine management system
control unit (computer) has a built-in self-
diagnosis system, which detects malfunctions
in the system sensors and stores them as
fault codes in its memory. It is not possible
without dedicated test equipment to extract
these fault codes from the control unit.
However, the procedures given in Chapters 4
and 5 may be used to check individual
components and sensors of the Motronic
system. If this fails to pinpoint a fault, then the
vehicle should be taken to a BMW dealer, who
will have the necessary diagnostic 
equipment to call up the fault codes from the
control unit. You will then have the 
option to repair the fault yourself, or
alternatively have the fault repaired by the
BMW dealer.
3 Electronic control unit (ECU)
- removal and refitting 2
Removal
1 The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is located
either inside the passenger compartment
under the right-hand side of the facia panel on
3-Series models, or in the engine
compartment on the right-hand side on 5-
Series models (see Chapter 4).
2 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
3 First remove the access cover on models
with the ECU on the right-hand side of the
engine compartment (see Chapter 4).
4 If the ECU is located inside the vehicle,
remove the access cover on the right-hand side.
5 Unplug the electrical connectors from the
ECU.
6 Remove the retaining bolts from the ECU
bracket.
7 Carefully remove the ECU. Note: Avoid static
electricity damage to the ECU by wearing rubber
gloves, and do not touch the connector pins.
Refitting
8 Refitting is a reversal of removal.
The most frequent cause of
emission system problems is
simply a leaking vacuum hose
or loose wire, so always
check the hose and wiring connections


4 Information sensors 2
Note: Refer to Chapters 4 and 5 for additional
information on the location and diagnosis of
the information sensors that are not covered in
this Section.
1 The coolant temperature sensor (see
illustration) is a thermistor (a resistor which
varies its resistance value in accordance with
temperature changes). The change in the
resistance value regulates the amount of
voltage that can pass through the sensor. At
low temperatures, the sensor’s resistance is
high. As the sensor temperature increases, its
resistance will decrease. Any failure in this
sensor circuit will in most cases be due to a
loose or shorted-out wire; if no wiring
problems are evident, check the sensor as
described below.
Check
2 To check the sensor, first check its
resistance (see illustration) when it is
completely cold (typically 2100 to 2900 ohms).
Next, start the engine and warm it up until it
reaches operating temperature. The resistance
should be lower (typically 270 to 400 ohms).
Note: If restricted access to the coolant
temperature sensor makes it difficult to attach
electrical probes to the terminals, remove the
sensor as described below, and perform the
tests in a container of heated water to simulate
the conditions.
Warning: Wait until the engine is
completely cool before beginning
this procedure.
Renewal
3 To remove the sensor, depress the spring
lock, unplug the electrical connector, then
carefully unscrew the sensor. Be prepared for
some coolant spillage; to reduce this, have
the new sensor ready for fitting as quickly as
possible.
Caution: Handle the coolant
sensor with care. Damage to this
sensor will affect the operation of
the entire fuel injection system. 
Note: It may be necessary to drain a small
amount of coolant from the radiator before
removing the sensor.
4 Before the sensor is fitted, ensure its
threads are clean, and apply a little sealant to
them.
5 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
Oxygen sensor
Note: Oxygen sensors are normally only fitted
to those vehicles equipped with a catalytic
converter. Most oxygen sensors are located in
the exhaust pipe, downstream from the
exhaust manifold. On 535 models, the oxygen
sensor is mounted in the catalytic converter.
The sensor’s electrical connector is located
near the bulkhead (left side) for easy access.
6 The oxygen sensor, which is located in the
exhaust system (see illustration), monitors
the oxygen content of the exhaust gas. The
oxygen content in the exhaust reacts with the
oxygen sensor, to produce a voltage output
which varies from 0.1 volts (high oxygen, lean
mixture) to 0.9 volts (low oxygen, rich
mixture). The ECU constantly monitors this
variable voltage output to determine the ratio
of oxygen to fuel in the mixture. The ECU
alters the air/fuel mixture ratio by controlling
the pulse width (open time) of the fuel
injectors. A mixture ratio of 14.7 parts air to 1
part fuel is the ideal mixture ratio for
minimising exhaust emissions, thus allowing
the catalytic converter to operate at maximum
efficiency. It is this ratio of 14.7 to 1 which the
ECU and the oxygen sensor attempt to
maintain at all times.
7 The oxygen sensor produces no voltage
when it is below its normal operating
temperature of about 320º C. During this initial
period before warm-up, the ECU operates in
“open-loop” mode (ie without the information
from the sensor).
8 If the engine reaches normal operating
temperature and/or has been running for two
or more minutes, and if the oxygen sensor is
producing a steady signal voltage below 
0.45 volts at 1500 rpm or greater, the ECU
fault code memory will be activated.
9 When there is a problem with the oxygen
sensor or its circuit, the ECU operates in the
“open-loop” mode - that is, it controls fuel
delivery in accordance with a programmed
default value instead of with feedback
information from the oxygen sensor.
10 The proper operation of the oxygen
sensor depends on four conditions:
a) Electrical - The low voltages generated by
the sensor depend upon good, clean
connections, which should be checked
whenever a malfunction of the sensor is
suspected or indicated.
b) Outside air supply - The sensor is
designed to allow air circulation to the
internal portion of the sensor. Whenever
the sensor is disturbed, make sure the air
passages are not restricted.
c) Proper operating temperature - The ECU
will not react to the sensor signal until the
sensor reaches approximately 320º C.
This factor must be taken into
consideration when evaluating the
performance of the sensor.
d) Unleaded fuel - The use of unleaded fuel
is essential for proper operation of the
sensor. Make sure the fuel you are using
is of this type.
11 In addition to observing the above
conditions, special care must be taken
whenever the sensor is serviced.
a) The oxygen sensor has a permanently-
attached pigtail and electrical connector,
which should not be removed from the
sensor. Damage or removal of the pigtail
or electrical connector can adversely
affect operation of the sensor.
b) Grease, dirt and other contaminants
should be kept away from the electrical
connector and the louvered end of the
sensor.
c) Do not use cleaning solvents of any kind
on the oxygen sensor.
d) Do not drop or roughly handle the sensor.
e) The silicone boot must be fitted in the
correct position, to prevent the boot from
being melted and to allow the sensor to
operate properly.

12 Warm up the engine, and let it run at idle.
Disconnect the oxygen sensor electrical
connector, and connect the positive probe of
a voltmeter to the oxygen sensor output
connector terminal (refer to the following
table) and the negative probe to earth (see
illustrations).
Note: Most oxygen sensor electrical
connectors are located at the rear of the
engine, near the bulkhead. Look for a large
rubber boot attached to a thick wire harness.
On early 535i models, the connector for the
oxygen sensor heater circuit is under the
vehicle. Look for a small protective cover.
These models should have the updated
oxygen sensor fitted, to make access similar
to other models. Consult your dealer service
department for additional information.
13 Increase and then decrease the engine
speed, and monitor the voltage.
14 When the speed is increased, the voltage
should increase to 0.5 to 1.0 volts. When the
speed is decreased, the voltage should fall to
about 0 to 0.4 volts.
15 Also where applicable, inspect the oxygen
sensor heater (models with multi-wire
sensors). With the ignition on, disconnect the
oxygen sensor electrical connector, and
connect a voltmeter across the terminals
designated in the chart (see below). There
should be battery voltage (approximately 
12 volts).
16 If the reading is not correct, check the
oxygen sensor heater relay (see Chapter 12).
If the information is not available, check the
owner’s handbook for the exact location of
the oxygen sensor heater relay. The relay
should receive battery voltage.
17 If the oxygen sensor fails any of these
tests, renew it.
Renewal
Note: Because it is fitted in the exhaust
manifold, converter or pipe, which contracts
when cool, the oxygen sensor may be very
difficult to loosen when the engine is cold.
Rather than risk damage to the sensor
(assuming you are planning to re-use it in
another manifold or pipe), start and run the
engine for a minute or two, then switch it off.
Be careful not to burn yourself during the
following procedure.
18 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
19 Raise and support the vehicle.
20 Disconnect the electrical connector from
the sensor.
21 Carefully unscrew the sensor.
Caution: Excessive force may
damage the threads.
22 A high-temperature anti-seize compound
must be used on the threads of the sensor, to
facilitate future removal. The threads of new
sensors will already be coated with this
compound, but if an old sensor is removed
and refitted, recoat the threads.
23 Refit the sensor and tighten it securely.
24 Reconnect the electrical connector of the
pigtail lead to the main engine wiring harness.
25 Lower the vehicle, and reconnect the
battery.

Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)
General description
26 The Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) is
located on the end of the throttle shaft on the
throttle body. By monitoring the output
voltage from the TPS, the ECU can determine
fuel delivery based on throttle valve angle
(driver demand). In this system, the TPS acts
as a switch rather than a potentiometer. One
set of throttle valve switch contacts is closed
(continuity) only at idle. A second set of
contacts closes as the engine approaches
full-throttle. Both sets of contacts are open
(no continuity) between these positions. A
broken or loose TPS can cause intermittent
bursts of fuel from the injector and an
unstable idle, because the ECU thinks the
throttle is moving.
27 All models (except for early 535i models
with automatic transmission) combine the idle
and full-throttle switch; a separate idle
position switch indicates the closed-throttle
position, while the TPS is used for the full-
throttle position. On 535i models with
automatic transmission, the TPS is connected
directly to the automatic transmission control
unit. With the throttle fully open, the
transmission control unit sends the full-
throttle signal to the Motronic control unit.
All models except early 535i with
automatic transmission
28 Remove the electrical connector from the
TPS, and connect an ohmmeter to terminals 2
and 18 (see illustrations). Open the throttle

4.12a  The oxygen sensor, once it is
warmed up (320º C), puts out a very small
voltage signal. To verify it is working,
check for voltage with a digital voltmeter
(the voltage signals usually range from 
0.1 to 1.0 volt)
4.28b  First check for continuity between
terminals 2 and 18 with the throttle closed
4.28a  The TPS on L-Jetronic systems is


slightly by hand. Release the throttle slowly
until it reaches 0.2 to 0.6 mm from the throttle
stop. There should be continuity.
29 Check the resistance between terminals 3
and 18 as the throttle is opened. There should
be continuity when the throttle switch is within
8 to 12 degrees of fully-open. If the readings
are incorrect, adjust the TPS.
30 If all the resistance readings are correct
and the TPS is properly adjusted, check for
power (5 volts) at the sensor, and if necessary
trace any wiring circuit problems between the
sensor and ECU (see Chapter 12).
Adjustment
31 If the adjustment is not as specified
(paragraphs 28 to 30), loosen the screws on
the TPS, and rotate the sensor into the correct
adjustment. Follow the procedure for
checking the TPS given above, and tighten
the screws when the setting is correct.
32 Recheck the TPS once more; if the
readings are correct, reconnect the TPS
harness connector.
Early 535i models with automatic
transmission
Check
33 First test the continuity of the TPS. Follow
paragraphs 28 to 30 and check for continuity.
34 Next, test the idle position switch (see
illustration). Unplug the electrical connector
in the idle position switch harness, and
connect an ohmmeter to terminals 1 and 2.
There should be continuity. Open the throttle
slightly, and measure the resistance. There
should now be no continuity.
35 Check for the correct voltage signals from
the TPS, with the throttle closed and the
ignition on. Probe the back of the TPS
connector with a voltmeter, and check for
voltage at terminal 3 (black wire) and earth.
There should be 5 volts present. Also, probe
terminal 3 (black wire) and terminal 1 (brown
wire). There should be 5 volts present here
also.
36 Check for voltage at terminal 2 (yellow
wire) and terminal 1 (brown wire), and slowly
open the throttle. The voltage should increase
steadily from 0.7 volts (throttle closed) to 
4.8 volts (throttle fully-open).
Adjustment
37 First measure the stabilised voltage. With
the ignition on and the throttle closed,
measure the voltage between terminal 3
(black wire) and terminal 1 (brown wire). It
should be about 5 volts.
38 Next, loosen the sensor mounting screws,
and connect the voltmeter to terminal 2
(yellow wire) and terminal 3 (black wire). With
the throttle fully open, rotate the switch until
there is 0.20 to 0.24 volts less than the
stabilised voltage. Note: You will need a
digital voltmeter to measure these small
changes in voltage.
39 Recheck the TPS once more; if the
readings are correct, reconnect the TPS
electrical connector. It is a good idea to lock
the TPS screws with paint or thread-locking
compound.
Airflow meter
General description
40 The airflow meter is located on the air
intake duct. The airflow meter measures the
amount of air entering the engine. The ECU
uses this information to control fuel delivery. A
large volume of air indicates acceleration,
while a small volume of air indicates
deceleration or idle. Refer to Chapter 4 for all
the diagnostic checks and renewal
procedures for the airflow meter.
Ignition timing sensors
41 Ignition timing is electronically-controlled
on Motronic systems, and is not adjustable.
During starting, a crankshaft position sensor
relays the crankshaft position to the ECU, and
an initial baseline ignition point is determined.
Once the engine is running, the ignition point
is continually changing based on the various
input signals to the ECU. Engine speed is
signalled by a speed sensor. Early Motronic
systems have the reference sensor and the
speed sensor mounted on the bellhousing
over the flywheel. Later Motronic systems
have a single sensor (pulse sensor) mounted
over the crankshaft pulley. This sensor
functions as a speed sensor as well as a
position sensor. Refer to Chapter 5 for more
information. Note: Some models are
equipped with a TDC sensor mounted on the
front of the engine. This sensor is strictly for
the BMW service test unit, and it is not part of
the Motronic ignition system.
5 Positive crankcase
ventilation (PCV) system
1 The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV)
system (see illustration) reduces
hydrocarbon emissions by scavenging
crankcase vapours. It does this by circulating
blow-by gases and then re-routing them to
the intake manifold by way of the air cleaner.
2 This PCV system is a sealed system. The
crankcase blow-by vapours are routed
directly to the air cleaner or air collector with
crankcase pressure behind them. The vapour
is not purged with fresh air on most models or

conventional systems. There are no
conventional PCV valves fitted on these
3 The main components of the PCV system
are the hoses that connect the valve cover to
the throttle body or air cleaner. If abnormal
operating conditions (such as piston ring
problems) arise, the system is designed to
allow excessive amounts of blow-by gases to
flow back through the crankcase vent tube
into the intake system, to be consumed by
normal combustion. Note: Since these
models don’t use a filtering element, it’s a
good idea to check the PCV system
passageways for clogging from sludge and
combustion residue (see illustration).
6 Evaporative emissions
control (EVAP) system 2
General description
Note: This system is normally only fitted to
those vehicles equipped with a catalytic
converter.
1 When the engine isn’t running, the fuel in the
fuel tank evaporates to some extent, creating
fuel vapour. The evaporative emissions control
system (see illustration) stores these fuel
vapours in a charcoal canister. When the
engine is cruising, the purge control valve is
opened slightly, and a small amount of fuel
vapour is drawn into the intake manifold and
burned. When the engine is starting cold or
idling, the purge valve prevents any vapours
from entering the intake manifold and causing
excessively-rich fuel mixture.
2 Two types of purge valve are used;
electrically-operated or vacuum-operated. To
find out which type is on your vehicle, follow
the hose from the charcoal canister until you
locate the purge valve. Some are located on
the intake manifold, and others near the
charcoal canister. Look for either an electrical
connector, or vacuum lines, to the purge
valve.
3 A faulty EVAP system will only affect engine
driveability when the engine is warm. The
EVAP system is not usually the cause of
difficult cold starting or any other cold-running
problems.
Check
Vacuum-operated purge valve
4 Remove the vacuum lines from the purge
valve, and blow into the larger valve port. It
should be closed, and not pass any air. Note:
Some models have a thermo-vacuum valve
that delays canister purging until the coolant
temperature reaches approximately 46º C.
Check this valve to make sure that vacuum is
controlled at the proper temperatures. The
valve is usually located in the intake manifold,
near the thermo-time switch and the coolant
temperature sensor.
5 Disconnect the small vacuum hose from the
purge valve, and apply vacuum with a hand-
held vacuum pump. The purge valve should
be open, and air should be able to pass
through.
6 If the test results are unsatisfactory, renew
the purge valve.
Electrically-operated purge valve
7 Disconnect any lines from the purge valve,
and (without disconnecting the electrical
connector) place it in a convenient spot for
testing.
8 Check that the valve makes a “click” sound
as the ignition is switched on (see
illustration).
9 If the valve does not “click”, disconnect the
valve connector, and check for power to the
valve using a test light or a voltmeter (see
illustration).
10 If battery voltage is present, but the valve
does not work, renew it. If there is no voltage
present, check the Motronic control unit and
the wiring.
Canister
11 Mark all the hoses for position, then
detach them from the canister.
12 Slide the canister out of its mounting clip.

5.3  It’s a good idea to check for excess
residue from the crankcase vapours
circulating in the hoses and ports - this
can eventually clog the system, and cause
a pressure increase in the engine block


On some models, it will be necessary to
release the retaining clip (see illustration).
13 Visually examine the canister for leakage
or damage.
14 Renew the canister if you find evidence of
damage or leakage.
7 Catalytic converter 1
General description
1 To reduce emissions of unburnt
hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO)
and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the later
vehicles covered by this manual are equipped
with a catalytic converter (see illustration).
The converter contains a ceramic honeycomb
coated with precious metals, which speed up
the reaction between the pollutants listed
previously and the oxygen in the exhaust gas.
The pollutants are oxidised to produce water
(H2O), nitrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2).
Check
2 Visually examine the converter(s) for cracks
or damage. Make sure all nuts and bolts are
tight.
3 Inspect the insulation cover (if applicable)
welded onto the converter - it should not be
loose.
Caution: If an insulation cover is
dented so that it touches the
converter housing inside,
excessive heat may be
transferred to the floor.
4 Start the engine and run it at idle speed.
5 Check for exhaust gas leakage from the
converter flanges. Check the body of each
converter for holes.
Component renewal
6 See Chapter 4 for removal and refitting
procedures.
Precautions
7 The catalytic converter is a reliable and
simple device, which needs no maintenance
in itself, but there are some facts of which an
owner should be aware, if the converter is to
function properly for its full service life.
(a) DO NOT use leaded (eg UK “4-star”)
petrol in a car equipped with a catalytic
converter - the lead will coat the precious
metals, reducing their converting
efficiency, and will eventually destroy the
converter.
(b) Always keep the ignition and fuel systems
well-maintained in accordance with the
manufacturer’s schedule, as given in
Chapter 1. In particular, ensure that the air
cleaner filter element, the fuel filter (where
fitted) and the spark plugs are renewed at
the correct interval. If the intake air/fuel
mixture is allowed to become too rich due
to neglect, unburned fuel will enter the
catalytic converter, overheating the
element and eventually destroying the
converter.
(c) If the engine develops a misfire, do not
drive the car at all (or at least as little as
possible) until the fault is cured - the
misfire will allow unburned fuel to enter
the converter, which will result in its
overheating, as noted above.
(d) DO NOT push- or tow-start the car - this
will soak the catalytic converter in
unburned fuel, causing it to overheat
when the engine does start - see (b) or (c)
above.
(e) DO NOT switch off the ignition at high
engine speeds - ie do not “blip” the
throttle immediately before switching off
the engine. If the ignition is switched off
at anything above idle speed, unburned
fuel will enter the (very hot) catalytic
converter, with the possible risk of its
igniting on the element and damaging the
converter.
(f) DO NOT use fuel or engine oil additives -
these may contain substances harmful to
the catalytic converter.
(g) DO NOT continue to use the car if the
engine burns oil to the extent of leaving a
visible trail of blue smoke - the unburned
carbon deposits will clog the converter
passages, and reduce its efficiency; in
severe cases, the element will overheat.
(h) Remember that the catalytic converter
operates at very high temperatures -
hence the heat shields on the car’s
underbody - and the casing will become
hot enough to ignite combustible
materials which brush against it. DO NOT,
therefore, park the car in dry
undergrowth, or over long grass or piles
of dead leaves.
(i) Remember that the catalytic converter is
FRAGILE - do not strike it with tools
during servicing work, and take great care
when working on the exhaust system.
Ensure that the converter is well clear of
any jacks or other lifting gear used to raise
the car, and do not drive the car over
rough ground, road humps, etc, in such a
way as to “ground” the exhaust system.
(j) In some cases, particularly when the car
is new and/or is used for stop/start
driving, a sulphurous smell (like that of
rotten eggs) may be noticed from the
exhaust. This is common to many
catalytic converter-equipped cars, and
seems to be due to the small amount of
sulphur found in some petrols reacting
with hydrogen in the exhaust, to produce
hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas; while this
gas is toxic, it is not produced in sufficient
amounts to be a problem. Once the car
has covered a few thousand miles, the
problem should disappear - in the
meanwhile, a change of driving style, or of
the brand of petrol used, may effect a
solution.
(k) The catalytic converter, used on a well-
maintained and well-driven car, should
last for 50 000 to 100 000 miles - from
this point on, the CO level should be
carefully checked regularly, to ensure that
the converter is still operating efficiently. If
the converter is no longer effective, it
must be renewed.

The engine electrical systems include all
ignition, charging and starting components.
Because of their engine-related functions,
these components are discussed separately
from body-related electrical devices such as
the lights, the instruments, etc. (which are
included in Chapter 12).
Always observe the following precautions
when working on the electrical systems:
a) Be extremely careful when servicing
engine electrical components. They are
easily damaged if improperly checked,
connected or handled.
b) Never leave the ignition switched on for
long periods of time with the engine off.
c) Don’t disconnect the battery cables while
the engine is running.
d) Observe the rules when jump-starting
your vehicle. Read the precautions at the
front of this manual.
e) Always disconnect the battery negative
cable first, and connect it last, to reduce
the risk of accidental short-circuits.
f) Don’t charge the battery with the cables
connected to the terminals.
It’s also a good idea to review the safety-
related information regarding the engine
electrical systems in the “Safety first” section
near the front of this manual before beginning
any operation included in this Chapter.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
2 Battery - 
emergency jump starting 1
Refer to the “Jump starting” procedure at
the front of this manual.
3 Battery - removal and refitting 1
Note: Depending on the model, the battery
may be located in the engine compartment, in
the rear luggage compartment, or under the
rear seat. Consult your owners handbook for
the location of the battery, if not already
known to you.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
2 Detach the cable from the positive terminal.
3 Remove the battery hold-down bracket
(see illustrations) and lift out the battery. Be
careful - it’s heavy. Do not tilt the battery to
any extent while it is being removed, and
store it upright.
4 While the battery is out, inspect the carrier
(tray) for corrosion (see Chapter 1).
5 If you are renewing the battery, make sure
that you get one that’s identical, with the
same dimensions, amperage rating, cold
cranking rating, etc.
6 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
4 Battery cables - 
check and renewal 1
Check
1 Periodically inspect the entire length of
each battery cable for damage, cracked or
burned insulation, and corrosion. 
Poor battery cable connections can cause
starting problems and decreased engine
performance.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
2 Check the cable-to-terminal connections at
the ends of the cables for cracks, loose wire
strands, and corrosion. The presence of
white, fluffy deposits under the insulation at
the cable terminal connection is a sign that
the cable is corroded, and should be cleaned
or renewed. Check the terminals for
distortion, missing mounting bolts, and
corrosion.
Renewal
3 When removing the cables, always
disconnect the negative cable first and
connect it up last. This reduces the risk of
accidental short-circuits. Even if only a new
positive cable is being fitted, be sure to
disconnect the negative cable from the
battery first (see Chapter 1 for further
information regarding battery cable removal).
4 Disconnect the old cables from the battery,
then trace each of them to their opposite ends
and detach them from the starter solenoid
and earth terminals. Note the routing of each
cable to ensure correct refitting.
5 If the old cables are to be renewed, take
them with you when buying new cables. It is
vitally important that you renew the cables
with identical parts. Cables have character-
istics that make them easy to identify: positive
cables are usually red, larger in cross-section,
and have a larger-diameter battery post
clamp; earth cables are usually black, smaller
in cross-section, and have a slightly smaller
diameter clamp for the negative post.
6 Clean the threads of the solenoid or earth
connection with a wire brush to remove rust
and corrosion.
7 Attach the cable to the solenoid or earth
connection, and tighten the mounting nut/bolt
securely.
8 Before connecting a new cable to the
battery, make sure that it reaches the battery
post without having to be stretched.
9 Connect the positive cable first, followed by
the negative cable.
5•2 Engine electrical systems
3.3b  The battery is mounted under the
rear seat on some models
3.3a  Always detach the cable from the
battery negative terminal first, then detach
the positive cable – to remove the hold-
down assembly, remove the nuts (arrowed)

terminal threads, to prevent
future corrosion.


5 Ignition system - general
The ignition system includes the ignition
switch, the battery, the distributor, the primary
(low-voltage/low-tension or LT) and
secondary (high-voltage/high-tension or HT)
wiring circuits, the spark plugs and the spark
plug leads. Models fitted with a carburettor or
L-Jetronic fuel injection are equipped with a
Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI) system.
Models fitted with the Motronic fuel injection
system have the ignition system incorporated
within the Motronic system (Digital Motor
Electronics or DME).
Transistorised Coil Ignition (TCI)
system
This system is has four major components;
the impulse generator, the ignition control
unit, the coil, and the spark plugs. The
impulse generator provides a timing signal for
the ignition system. Equivalent to cam-
actuated breaker points in a standard
distributor, the impulse generator creates an
A/C voltage signal every time the trigger
wheel tabs pass the impulse generator tabs.
When the ignition control unit (capacitive
discharge unit) receives the voltage signal, it
triggers a spark discharge from the coil by
interrupting the primary coil circuit. The
ignition dwell (coil charging time) is adjusted
by the ignition control unit for the most
intense spark. Note: The air gap (distance
between the impulse generator and trigger
wheel tabs) can be adjusted (see Section 11).
Ignition timing is mechanically adjusted
(see Section 7). A centrifugal advance unit
that consists of spring-loaded rotating
weights advances ignition timing as engine
speed increases. The vacuum advance
adjusts ignition timing to compensate for
changes in engine load.
Motronic ignition system
This system, also known as Digital Motor
Electronics (DME), incorporates all ignition
and fuel injection functions into one central
control unit or ECU (computer). The ignition
timing is based on inputs the ECU receives for
engine load, engine speed, coolant
temperature and intake air temperature. The
only function the distributor performs is the
distribution of the high voltage signal to the
individual spark plugs. The distributor is
attached directly to the cylinder head. There is
no mechanical spark advance system used on
these systems.
Ignition timing is electronically-controlled,
and is not adjustable on Motronic systems.
During starting, a crankshaft position sensor
(reference sensor) relays the crankshaft
position to the ECU, and an initial baseline
ignition point is determined. Once the engine
is running, the ignition timing is continually
changing, based on the various input signals
to the ECU. Engine speed is signalled by a
speed sensor. Early Motronic systems have
the position reference sensor and the speed
sensor mounted on the bellhousing over the
flywheel on the left-hand side. Later Motronic
systems have a single sensor (pulse sensor)
mounted over the crankshaft pulley. This
sensor functions as a speed sensor as well as
a position reference sensor. Refer to Sec-
tion 12 for checking and renewing the ignition
sensors. Note: Some models are equipped
with a TDC sensor mounted on the front of the
engine. This sensor is strictly for the BMW
service test unit, and it is not part of the
Motronic ignition system.
Precautions
Certain precautions must be observed
when working on a transistorised ignition
system.
a) Do not disconnect the battery cables
when the engine is running
b) Make sure the ignition control unit (TCI
ignition system) is always well earthed
(see Section 10).
c) Keep water away from the distributor and
HT leads.
d) If a tachometer is to be connected to the
engine, always connect the tachometer
positive (+) lead to the ignition coil
negative terminal (-) and never to the
distributor.
e) Do not allow the coil terminals to be
earthed, as the impulse generator or coil
could be damaged.
f) Do not leave the ignition switch on for
more than ten minutes with the engine
off, or if the engine will not start. 
6 Ignition system - check 2
Warning: Because of the high
voltage generated by the ignition
system, extreme care should be
taken whenever an operation is
performed involving ignition components.
This not only includes the impulse
generator (electronic ignition), coil,
distributor and spark plug HT leads, but
related components such as spark plug
connectors, tachometer and other test
equipment.
1 If the engine turns over but will not start,
disconnect the spark plug HT lead from any
spark plug, and attach it to a calibrated spark
tester (available at most car accessory 
shops). 
Note: There are two different types of spark
testers. Be sure to specify electronic
(breakerless) ignition. Connect the clip on the
tester to an earth point such as a metal
bracket (see illustration).
2 If you are unable to obtain a calibrated
spark tester, remove the spark plug HT lead
from one of the spark plugs. Using an
insulated tool, hold the lead about a quarter-
inch from the engine block - make sure the
gap is not more than a quarter-inch, or
damage may be caused to the electronic
components.
3 Crank the engine, and observe the tip of the
tester or spark plug HT lead to see if a spark
occurs. If bright-blue, well-defined sparks
occur, sufficient voltage is reaching the plugs
to fire the engine. However, the plugs
themselves may be fouled, so remove and
check them as described in Chapter 1.
4 If there’s no spark, check another HT lead
in the same manner. A few sparks followed by
no spark is the same condition as no spark at
all.
5 If no spark occurs, remove the distributor
cap, and check the cap and rotor as
described in Chapter 1. If moisture is present,
use a water-dispersant aerosol (or something
similar) to dry out the cap and rotor, then refit
the cap and repeat the spark test.
6 If there’s still no spark, disconnect the coil
HT lead from the distributor cap, and 
test this lead as described for the spark plug
leads.
7 If no spark occurs, check the primary wire
connections at the coil to make sure they’re
clean and tight. Make any necessary repairs,
then repeat the check.
8 If sparks do occur from the coil HT lead, the
distributor cap, rotor, plug HT lead(s) or spark
plug(s) may be defective. If there’s still no
spark, the coil-to-cap HT lead may be
defective. If a substitute lead doesn’t make
any difference, check the ignition coil (see
Section 9). Note: Refer to Sections 10 and 11
for more test procedures on the distributors
fitted with the TCI ignition system.
Engine electrical systems  5•3
6.1  To use a spark tester, simply
disconnect a spark plug HT lead, clip the
tester to a convenient earth (like a valve
cover bolt or nut) and operate the starter –
if there is enough power to fire the plug,
sparks will be visible between the
electrode tip and the tester body


7 Ignition timing (TCI system) -
check and adjustment 4
Warning: Keep hands, equipment
and wires well clear of the
viscous cooling fan during
adjustment of the ignition timing.
Note: This Section describes the procedure
for checking and adjusting the ignition timing
on engines fitted with the TCI system. On
engines fitted with the Motronic engine
management system, the ignition timing is
controlled by the electronic control unit, and
no adjustment is possible. The timing can be
checked using the following procedure, but no
ignition timing values were available at the
time of writing. If the timing is thought to be
incorrect, refer to a BMW dealer.
1 Some special tools are required for this
procedure (see illustration). The engine must
be at normal operating temperature, and the
air conditioning (where fitted) must be
switched off. Make sure the idle speed is
correct.
2 Apply the handbrake, and chock the wheels
to prevent movement of the vehicle. The
transmission must be in neutral (manual) or
Park (automatic).
3 The timing marks are located on the engine
flywheel (viewed through the timing check
hole in the bellhousing) and/or on the vibration
damper on the front of the engine.
4 Where applicable, disconnect the vacuum
hose from the distributor vacuum advance
unit.
5 Connect a tachometer and timing light
according to the equipment manufacturer’s
instructions (an inductive pick-up timing light
is preferred). Generally, the power leads for
the timing light are attached to the battery
terminals, and the pick-up lead is attached to
the No 1 spark plug HT lead. The No 1 spark
plug is the one at the front of the engine.
Caution: If an inductive pick-up
timing light isn’t available, don’t
puncture the spark plug HT lead
to attach the timing light pick-up
lead. Instead, use an adapter between the
spark plug and HT lead. If the insulation on
the HT lead is damaged, the secondary
voltage will jump to earth at the damaged
point, and the engine will misfire.
Note: On some models, a TDC transmitter is
fitted for checking the ignition system.
However, a special BMW tester must be
connected to the diagnostic socket to use it,
so unless the special tester is available, a
conventional timing light should be used. The
ignition timing mark may be on the vibration
damper, but if not, normally the TDC mark will
be. If the timing light is of the adjustable delay
type, then the ignition timing may be
determined by zeroing the adjustment, then
turning the adjustment until the TDC marks are
aligned, and then reading off the amount of
advance from the timing light. If a standard
timing light is being used, make a mark on the
vibration damper in accordance with the
specified advance, using the following formula
to calculate the distance from the TDC mark
to the timing mark:
Distance = 2Pr x advance
360
where P = 3.142
r = radius of vibration damper
advance = specified advance 
BTDC in degrees
6 With the ignition off, loosen the distributor
clamp nut just enough to allow the distributor
to pivot without any slipping.
7 Make sure the timing light wires are routed
away from the drivebelts and fan, then start
the engine.
8 Raise the engine rpm to the specified
speed, and then point the flashing timing light
at the timing marks - be very careful of moving
engine components.
9 The mark on the flywheel or vibration
damper will appear stationary. If it’s aligned
with the specified point on the bellhousing or
engine front cover, the ignition timing is
correct (see illustrations).
10 If the marks aren’t aligned, adjustment is
required. Turn the distributor very slowly until
the marks are aligned, taking care not to
touch the HT leads.
11 Tighten the nut on the distributor clamp,
and recheck the timing.
12 Switch off the engine, and remove the
timing light and tachometer. Reconnect the
vacuum hose where applicable.

Removal
18 Remove the cover from the distributor
(see illustration) and remove the distributor
cap (see Chapter 1).
19 Using a small Allen key, remove the three
screws from the rotor (see illustration).
20 Remove the rotor.
21 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
9 Ignition coil -
check and renewal 2
Caution: Do not earth the coil, as
the coil and/or impulse generator
could be damaged.
Note: On models equipped with the Motronic
system, a faulty ECU can cause the ignition
coil to become damaged. Be sure to test the
ignition coil if the engine will not start and an
ECU fault is suspected.
1 Mark the wires and terminals for position,
then remove the primary circuit wires and the
HT lead from the coil.
2 Remove the coil assembly from its
mounting, then clean the outer casing and
check it for cracks and other damage.
3 Inspect the coil primary terminals and the
coil tower terminal for corrosion. Clean them
with a wire brush if any corrosion is found.
4 Check the coil primary resistance by
attaching an ohmmeter to the primary
terminals (see illustrations). Compare the
measured resistance to the Specifications
listed in this Chapter.
5 Check the coil secondary resistance by
connecting one of the ohmmeter leads to one
of the primary terminals, and the other
ohmmeter lead to the coil high-tension
terminal (see illustrations). On TCI systems,

and the centre tower. On Motronic systems,
connect the ohmmeter to coil terminal 15 (+)
and the centre tower. Compare the measured
resistance with the values given in the Specifi-
cations in this Chapter.
6 If the measured resistances are not close to
those specified, the coil is defective and
should be renewed. Note that the measured
resistance will vary according to the
temperature of the coil, so don’t rush to
condemn the coil if the resistance is only a
little way out.
7 It is essential for proper ignition system
operation that all coil terminals and wire leads
be kept clean and dry.
8 Refit the coil in its mounting, and reconnect
the wiring. Refitting is the reverse of removal.
10 Impulse generator and
ignition control unit - check
and renewal (TCI system)
3
1 The impulse generator (located in the
distributor) and ignition control unit need to be
tested in the event there is no spark at the
spark plugs. Make sure the plug leads,
ignition coil and spark plugs are working
properly (see Sections 6 and 9). There are two
types of control units; Bosch or
Siemens/Telefunken. The two types (see
illustration) can be distinguished by their
electrical connectors. The Bosch type uses a
single, large rectangular connector at the
bottom of the unit, while the
Siemens/Telefunken control unit uses two
round electrical connectors at the front of the
unit.
Check
Voltage supply and earth to ignition
control unit
2 With the ignition off, remove the harness
connectors from the ignition control unit (see
illustrations). Connect a voltmeter between
connector terminals 2 and 4 on Bosch
systems, or between terminals 6 and 3 on
Siemens/Telefunken systems.
3 Turn the ignition on. There should be
battery voltage on the designated terminals. If
there is no voltage, check the wiring harness
for an open-circuit (see Chapter 12).
4 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity
between connector terminal 2 (Bosch) or 6
(Siemens/Telefunken) and the earth to the
vehicle body. Continuity should exist.
5 Using an ohmmeter, check for continuity
between connector terminal 4 (Bosch) or 3
(Siemens/Telefunken) and terminal 15 of the
ignition coil. Continuity should exist.
6 If the readings are incorrect, repair the
wiring harness.

8 Use a digital voltmeter for the following
a) On Bosch systems, connect the positive
probe to connector terminal 5, and the
negative probe to terminal 6 (see
b) On Siemens/Telefunken systems, connect
the positive probe to terminal (+) of the
smaller connector, and the negative
probe to terminal (-).
9 Have an assistant crank the engine over,
and check that there is 1 to 2 volts A/C
present. If there is no voltage, check the
wiring harness between the impulse generator
(in the distributor) and the control unit. If the
harness is OK, check the impulse generator
resistance.
Warning: Do not crank the
engine over for an excessive
length of time. If necessary,
disconnect the cold start injector
electrical connector (see Chapter 4) to
stop the flow of fuel into the engine.
10 To check the resistance in the impulse
generator, proceed as described for your
system below:
a) On Bosch units, measure the resistance
between connector terminals 5 and 6
(see illustration 10.8). The reading
should be 1000 to 1200 ohms.
b) On Siemens/Telefunken units, measure
the resistance between the terminals of
the smaller connector. The reading should
be 1000 to 1200 ohms.
11 If the resistance readings are incorrect,
renew the impulse generator. If the resistance
readings for the impulse generator are correct
and the control unit voltages (supply voltage
[paragraphs 1 to 6] and signal voltage
[paragraphs 7 to 9]) are incorrect, renew the
control unit.
Renewal

12 Make sure the ignition is switched off.
13 Disconnect the electrical connector(s)
from the control unit.
14 Remove the mounting screws from the
control unit, and lift it from the engine
compartment.
15 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
On Bosch control units, a special dielectric
grease is used between the heat sink and the
back of the control unit. In the event the two
are separated (renewal or testing) the old
grease must be removed, and the heat sink
cleaned off using 180-grit sandpaper. Apply
Curil K2 (Bosch part number 81 22 9 243). A
silicon dielectric compound can be used as a
substitute. This treatment is very important for
the long life of these expensive ignition parts.
Impulse generator
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
16 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
17 Remove the distributor from the engine
(see Section 8).
18 Using a pair of circlip pliers, remove the
circlip retaining the trigger wheel (see
19 Use two flat-bladed screwdrivers
positioned at opposite sides of the trigger
wheel, and carefully prise it up (see
illustration). Note: Push the screwdrivers in
as far as possible without bending the trigger
wheel. Prise only on the strongest, centre
portion of the trigger wheel. In the event the
trigger wheel is bent, it must be replaced with
a new one. Note: Be sure not to lose the roll
pin when lifting out the trigger wheel.
20 Remove the mounting screws from the
impulse generator electrical connector, the
vacuum diaphragm and the baseplate.
21 Remove the two screws from the vacuum
advance unit, and separate it from the
distributor by moving the assembly down
while unhooking it from the baseplate pin.
22 Use circlip pliers to remove the circlip that
retains the impulse generator and the
baseplate assembly.
23 Carefully remove the impulse generator
and the baseplate assembly as a single unit.
24 Remove the three screws, and separate
the baseplate assembly from the impulse
generator.
25 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
Be sure to position the insulating ring between
the generator coil and the baseplate. It must
be centred before tightening the mounting
screws. Also, it will be necessary to
check/adjust the air gap if the trigger wheel
has been removed, or tampered with to the
point that the clearance is incorrect (see
Section 11).
11 Air gap (TCI system) - 
check and adjustment 2
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you

and down - you should feel a slight drag on
the feeler gauge as it is moved if the gap is
correct. The gap must be as given in this
Chapter’s Specifications.
3 To adjust the gap, it is necessary to remove
the impulse generator and the baseplate
assembly from the distributor (see illus-
tration 10.1).
4 Follow paragraphs 17 to 24 in Section 10
and loosen the screws that retain the impulse
generator to the baseplate assembly.
5 Carefully insert the feeler gauge and tighten
the screws.
6 Refit the assembly back into the distributor
and recheck the adjustment.
12 Ignition sensors (Motronic
system) - check and renewal 2
Note: Some models are equipped with a TDC
sensor mounted on the front of the engine.
This sensor is strictly for the BMW service test
unit, and is not part of the Motronic ignition
system.
Speed and position sensors
Check
1 Locate the two electrical connectors for the
sensors (see illustrations). The grey
connector is for the position sensor, and the
white connector is for the speed sensor.
2 Using an ohmmeter, check the resistance
between terminal 1 (yellow wire) and terminal
2 (black wire) on the sensor side of each
connector. The resistance should be 860 to
1,060 ohms.
3 Also check the resistance between terminal
3 and either terminal 1 or terminal 2. The
resistance should be approximately 100 000
ohms.
4 If the reading(s) are incorrect, renew the
sensor(s).
Renewal
5 Remove the sensor mounting screw(s),
using an Allen key where necessary, and pull
the sensor(s) from the sockets. Disconnect
the wiring from one sensor at a time - be sure
the connectors are not interchanged when
fitting new sensors. The bellhousing is marked
with a B for the position sensor (grey
connector) and D for the speed sensor (black
connector) (see illustration). Note: It is a
good idea to check the condition of the raised
pin on the flywheel while the sensors are out
of the sockets. Turn the engine by hand as
necessary to bring the pin into view.
6 Tighten the sensor mounting screw(s)
securely, but be careful not to overtighten.
Pulse sensor (later models)

7 Locate the two electrical connectors for the
sensor (see illustrations). Disconnect the
electrical connector from the front. 
8 Using an ohmmeter, check resistance
between terminal 1 (yellow wire) and terminal
2 (black wire) on the sensor side of each
connector (see illustration). The resistance
should be 500 to 600 ohms.
9 If the reading is incorrect, renew the sensor.

13 Charging system - general
information and precautions
There are two different types of alternator
fitted on these models; Bosch and Motorola.
Also, there are three different amperage
ratings available; 65A, 80A or 90A. A stamped
serial number on the rear of the alternator will
identify the type and amperage rating.
Perform the charging system checks (see
Section 14) to diagnose any problems with the
alternator.
The voltage regulator and the alternator
brushes are mounted as a single assembly.
On Bosch alternators, this unit can be
removed from the alternator (see Section 16)
and the components serviced individually.
The alternator on all models is mounted on
the left front of the engine, and utilises a V-
belt and pulley drive system. Drivebelt tension
and battery servicing are the two primary
maintenance requirements for these systems.
See Chapter 1 for the procedures regarding
engine drivebelt checking and battery
servicing.
The ignition/no-charge warning light should
come on when the ignition key is turned to
Start, then go off immediately the engine
starts. If it remains on, there is a malfunction
in the charging system (see Section 14). Some
vehicles are also equipped with a voltmeter. If
the voltmeter indicates abnormally high or low
voltage, check the charging system (see
Section 14). Note: On models up to 1986, a
blown ignition/no-charge warning light will
prevent the alternator from charging. After
1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the
warning light in order to allow current to
bypass the light in the event of a broken circuit
(blown warning light).
Precautions
Be very careful when making electrical
circuit connections to the alternator, and note
the following:
a) When reconnecting wires to the alternator
from the battery, be sure to note the
polarity.
b) Before using arc-welding equipment to
repair any part of the vehicle, disconnect
the wires from the battery terminals and
from the alternator.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
c) Never start the engine with a battery
charger connected. Always disconnect
both battery cables before using a battery
charger.
d) Never disconnect cables from the battery
or from the alternator while the engine is
running.
e) The alternator is turned by an engine
drivebelt. Serious injury could result if
your hands, hair or clothes become
entangled in the belt with the engine
running.
f) Because the alternator is connected
directly to the battery, take care not to
short out the main terminal to earth.
g) Wrap a plastic bag over the alternator,
and secure it with rubber bands, before
steam-cleaning the engine.
14 Charging system - check 3
1 If a malfunction occurs in the charging
circuit, don’t automatically assume that the
alternator is causing the problem. First check
the following items:
a) Check the drivebelt tension and condition
(see Chapter 1). Renew the drivebelt if it’s
worn or deteriorated.
b) Make sure the alternator mounting and
adjustment bolts are tight.
c) Inspect the alternator wiring harness and
the connectors at the alternator and
voltage regulator. They must be in good
condition and tight.
d) Check the fuses.
e) Start the engine and check the alternator
for abnormal noises (a shrieking or
squealing sound indicates a worn bearing,
but could also be due to a slipping
drivebelt - see a) above).
f) Check the specific gravity of the battery
electrolyte. If it’s low, charge the battery
(doesn’t apply to maintenance-free
batteries).
g) Make sure the battery is fully-charged
(one bad cell in a battery can cause
overcharging by the alternator).
h) Disconnect the battery cables (negative
first, then positive). Inspect the battery
posts and the cable clamps for corrosion.
Clean them thoroughly if necessary (see
Chapter 1).
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
2 With the ignition off, connect a 12 volt test
light between the battery negative post and
the disconnected negative cable clamp. If the
test light does not come on, refit the cable
and proceed to paragraph 4. If the test light
comes on, there is a short (drain) in the
electrical system of the vehicle. The short
must be repaired before the charging system
can be checked. Note: Accessories which are
always on (such as the clock or the radio
station memory) must be disconnected before
performing this check.
3 Disconnect the alternator wiring harness. If
the test light now goes out, the alternator is
faulty. If the light stays on, remove each fuse
in turn until the light goes out (this will tell you
which component is shorting out).
4 Using a voltmeter, check the battery
voltage with the engine off. It should be
approximately 12 volts.
5 Start the engine and check the battery
voltage again. It should now be approximately
14 to 15 volts.
6 Turn on the headlights. The voltage should
drop, and then come back up, if the charging
system is working properly.
7 If the voltage reading is more than the
specified charging voltage, renew the voltage
regulator (refer to Section 16). If the voltage is
less, the alternator diode(s), stator or rotor
may be faulty, or the voltage regulator may be
malfunctioning.
8 If there is no short-circuit causing battery
drain but the battery is constantly
discharging, then either the battery itself is
defective, the alternator drivebelt is loose (see
Chapter 1), the alternator brushes are worn,
dirty or disconnected (see Section 17), the
voltage regulator is malfunctioning (see
Section 16) or the diodes, stator coil or rotor
coil are defective. Repairing or renewing the
diodes, stator coil or rotor coil is beyond the
scope of the home mechanic. Either renew

the alternator complete, or take it to an
automotive electrician, who may be able to
overhaul it. Note: On models up to 1986, a
blown ignition/no-charge warning light bulb
will prevent the alternator from charging. After
1987, a resistor is wired in parallel with the
warning light, in order to allow current to
bypass the light in the event of a broken circuit
(blown warning light).
15 Alternator - 
removal and refitting 1
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Detach the battery negative cable.
2 Detach the electrical connectors from the
alternator, noting their locations for refitting
(see illustration). Note: On some models, it
may be necessary to remove the air cleaner
assembly and airflow meter to gain access to
the alternator.
3 Loosen the alternator adjustment and pivot
bolts, and slip off the drivebelt (see Chap-
ter 1).
4 Remove the adjustment and pivot bolts,
and separate the alternator from the engine.
Refitting
5 If you are renewing the alternator, take the
old one with you when purchasing a new or
reconditioned unit. Make sure the new unit
looks identical to the old alternator. Look at
the terminals - they should be the same in
number, size and location as the terminals on
the old alternator. Finally, look at the identifi-
cation numbers - they will be stamped into the
housing, or printed on a tag attached to the
housing. Make sure the numbers are the same
on both alternators.
6 Many new alternators do not come with a
pulley fitted, so you may have to transfer the
pulley from the old unit to the new one.
7 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
8 After the alternator is fitted, adjust the
drivebelt tension (see Chapter 1).
9 Check the charging voltage to verify 
proper operation of the alternator (see Sec-
tion 14).
16 Voltage regulator - renewal 1
1 The voltage regulator controls the charging
system voltage by limiting the alternator
output. The regulator is a sealed unit, and isn’t
adjustable.
2 If the voltmeter indicates that the alternator
is not charging (or if the ignition/no-charge
warning light comes on) and the alternator,
battery, drivebelt tension and electrical
connections seem to be fine, have the
regulator checked by a dealer service
department or electrical specialist.
3 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Bosch alternator
4 The voltage regulator is mounted externally
on the alternator housing. To renew the
regulator, remove the mounting screws (see
illustration) and lift it off the alternator (see
illustration). Note: Some Bosch alternators
have an integral voltage regulator which is part
of the brush assembly.
5 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
Before refitting the regulator, check the
condition of the slip rings (see illustration).
Use a torch and check for any scoring or deep
wear grooves. Renew the alternator if
necessary.

1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Bosch alternator
2 Remove the voltage regulator from the back
of the alternator (see Section 16).
3 Measure the length of the brushes (see
illustration). They should not be less than 
6.0 mm. If any are worn past this point, renew
them all as a set. 
4 Also check for excessively worn slip rings
(see illustration 16.5).
5 The brushes are retained either by set
screws or by solder. If you are not skilled at
soldering, it may be best to have an auto
electrician fit the new brushes. Note: Be
careful not to apply heat to the solder joint for
more than 5 seconds. If necessary, use a heat
sink to capture the excess heat. This can be
accomplished by clamping a pair of needle-
nose pliers next to the solder joint.
6 On the screw type, hold the assembly in
place and refit the screws. Tighten them
evenly, a little at a time, so the holder isn’t
distorted.
7 Refit the regulator assembly to the
alternator.
8 Reconnect the battery negative cable.
Motorola alternator
9 Remove the alternator.
10 The brushes are mounted under the
regulator on the rear of the alternator (see
illustration 16.7).
11 Remove the mounting screws and
insulating washers, and separate the voltage
regulator and brush holder from the brush end
housing.
12 Measure the length of the brushes (see
illustration 17.3). If any brush is less then 
6.0 mm long, renew them all as a set.
13 Make sure the brushes move smoothly in
the holder.
14 Refit the brush holder/regulator. Tighten
the screws securely. Make sure the brushes
aren’t earthed.
15 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
18 Starting system - general
information and precautions
The sole function of the starting system is
to turn over the engine quickly enough to
allow it to start.
The starting system consists of the battery,
the starter motor, the starter solenoid, the
ignition switch, and the wires connecting
them. The solenoid is mounted directly on the
starter motor. The starter/solenoid motor
assembly is fitted on the lower part of the
engine, next to the transmission bellhousing.
When the ignition key is turned to the Start
position, the starter solenoid is actuated
through the starter control circuit. The starter
solenoid then connects the battery to the
starter, and moves the starter pinion into
mesh with the flywheel ring gear. The battery
supplies the electrical energy to the starter
motor, which does the actual work of cranking
the engine.
The starter motor on some manual
transmission vehicles can only be operated
when the clutch pedal is depressed. On a
vehicle equipped with automatic
transmission, the starter can only be operated

Note: Before diagnosing starter problems,
make sure the battery is fully charged.
1 If the starter motor does not turn at all when
the switch is operated, make sure that the
gear lever is in Neutral or Park (automatic
transmission) or, where applicable, that the
clutch pedal is depressed (manual
transmission).
2 Make sure that the battery is charged, and
that all cables, both at the battery and starter
solenoid terminals, are clean and secure.
3 If the starter motor spins but the engine is
not cranking, the overrun clutch in the starter
motor is slipping, and the starter motor must
be renewed.
4 If, when the switch is actuated, the starter
motor does not operate at all but the solenoid
clicks, then the problem lies either in the
battery, the main solenoid contacts, or the
starter motor itself (or the engine is seized).
5 If the solenoid plunger cannot be heard
when the switch is actuated, the battery is
faulty, the switch is defective, the fusible link
is burned-out (the circuit is open), or the
solenoid itself is defective.
6 To check the solenoid, connect a jumper
lead between the battery (+) and the ignition
switch wire terminal (the small terminal) on the
solenoid. If the starter motor now operates,
the solenoid is OK and the problem is in the
ignition switch, starter inhibitor switch
(automatic transmission models), clutch
switch (some manual transmission models), or
the wiring.
7 If the starter motor still does not operate,
remove the starter/solenoid assembly for
dismantling, testing and repair.
8 If the starter motor cranks the engine at an
abnormally-slow speed, first make sure that
the battery is charged, and that all terminal
connections are tight. If the engine is partially-
seized, or has the wrong viscosity oil in it, it
will crank slowly.
9 Run the engine until normal operating
temperature is reached, then disconnect the
coil HT lead from the distributor cap and earth
it on the engine.
10 Connect a voltmeter positive lead to the
battery positive post, and connect the
negative lead to the negative post.
11 Crank the engine, and take the voltmeter
readings as soon as a steady figure is
indicated. Do not allow the starter motor to
turn for more than 10 seconds at a time. A
reading of 9 volts or more, with the starter
motor turning at normal cranking speed, is
normal. If the reading is 9 volts or more but
the cranking speed is slow, the solenoid
contacts are burned, there is a bad
connection, or the starter motor itself is faulty.
If the reading is less than 9 volts and the
cranking speed is slow, the starter motor is
faulty or the battery is responsible (defective
or discharged).
20 Starter motor - 
removal and refitting 1
Note: If the starter motor is defective, it should
be renewed, or taken to an auto electrical
specialist for repair. Overhaul of the starter
motor is unlikely to be a practical proposition
for the home mechanic, even if spare parts are
available. However, the solenoid can be
renewed separately (see Section 21).

4•2 Fuel and exhaust systems
1 General information
With the exception of early models (316 and
518 models) all engines are equipped with
electronic fuel injection.
Early 316 and 518 models are equipped
with Solex carburettors. The carburettor fitted
is either a Solex 2B4 (early models) or 
2BE (later models). The mechanical fuel pump
is driven by an eccentric lobe on the
camshaft.
Fuel injection models are equipped with
either the L-Jetronic or the Motronic fuel
injection system. From 1988, fuel injection
models are equipped with an updated version
of the Motronic system - this system is easily
distinguished from the earlier system by the
absence of a cold start injector. The electric
fuel pump is located beneath the rear of the
vehicle, or inside the fuel tank. The fuel pump
relay on Motronic systems is activated from a
earth signal from the Motronic control unit
(ECU). The fuel pump operates for a few
seconds when the ignition is first switched on,
and it continues to operate only when the
engine is actually running.
Air intake system
The air intake system consists of the air
filter housing, the airflow meter and throttle
body (fuel injection models), and the intake
manifold. All components except the intake
manifold are covered in this Chapter; for


information on removing and refitting the
intake manifold, refer to Chapter 2A.
The throttle valve inside the throttle body or
carburettor is actuated by the accelerator
cable. When you depress the accelerator
pedal, the throttle plate opens and airflow
through the intake system increases.
On fuel injection systems, a flap inside the
airflow meter opens wider as the airflow
increases. A throttle position switch attached
to the pivot shaft of the flap detects the angle
of the flap (how much it’s open) and converts
this to a voltage signal, which it sends to the
computer.
Fuel system
On carburettor models, the fuel pump
supplies fuel under pressure to the
carburettor. A needle valve in the float
chamber maintains the fuel at a constant
level. A fuel return system channels excess
fuel back to the fuel tank.
On fuel injection models, an electric fuel
pump supplies fuel under constant pressure
to the fuel rail, which distributes fuel to the
injectors. The electric fuel pump is located
inside the fuel tank on later models, or beside
the fuel tank on early models. Early models
also have a transfer pump located in the fuel
tank. The transfer pump acts as an aid to the
larger main pump for delivering the necessary
pressure. A fuel pressure regulator controls
the pressure in the fuel system. The fuel
system also has a fuel pulsation damper
located near the fuel filter. The damper
reduces the pressure pulsations caused by
fuel pump operation, and the opening and
closing of the injectors. The amount of fuel
injected into the intake ports is precisely
controlled by an Electronic Control Unit (ECU
or computer). Some later 5-Series models
have a fuel cooler in the return line.
Electronic control system (fuel
injection system)
Besides altering the injector opening
duration as described above, the electronic
control unit performs a number of other tasks
related to fuel and emissions control. It
accomplishes these tasks by using data
relayed to it by a wide array of information
sensors located throughout the engine
compartment, comparing this information to
its stored map, and altering engine operation
by controlling a number of different actuators.
Since special equipment is required, most
fault diagnosis and repair of the electronic
control system is beyond the scope of the
home mechanic. Additional information and
testing procedures for the emissions system
components (oxygen sensor, coolant
temperature sensor, EVAP system, etc.) is
contained in Chapter 6.
2 Fuel injection system -
depressurising 1
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs near the work area. Also, don’t work
in a garage where a natural gas-type
appliance with a pilot light is present.
1 Remove the fuel pump fuse from the main
fuse panel (see illustrations). Note: Consult
your owner’s handbook for the exact location
of the fuel pump fuse, if the information is not
stamped onto the fusebox cover.
2 Start the engine, and wait for it to stall.
Switch off the ignition.
3 Remove the fuel filler cap to relieve the fuel
tank pressure.
4 The fuel system is now depressurised.
Note: Place a rag around fuel lines before
disconnecting, to prevent any residual fuel
from spilling onto the engine (see
illustration).
5 Disconnect the battery negative cable
before working on any part of the system.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.

check 3
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Also, don’t work
in a garage where a natural gas-type
appliance with a pilot light is present.
Carburettor engines
1 To test the fuel pump, it will be necessary to
connect a suitable pressure gauge between
the fuel pump outlet, and the carburettor
supply pipe. For this particular test, the fuel
return valve, which is normally connected in
the fuel line from the fuel pump to the
carburettor, must be bypassed.
2 With the engine running at idle speed, the
pump pressure should be between 0.1 and
0.3 bars.
3 Should a pressure gauge not be available, a
simpler (but less accurate) method of testing
the fuel pump is as follows.
4 Disconnect the outlet hose from the fuel
pump.
5 Disconnect the LT lead from the coil, to
prevent the engine firing, then turn the engine
over on the starter. Well-defined spurts of fuel
should be ejected from the outlet hose.
Fuel injection engines
Note 1: The electric fuel pump is located
inside the fuel tank on later models, or beside
the fuel tank on early models. Early models are
also equipped with a transfer pump located in
the fuel tank. The transfer pump feeds the
main pump, but can’t generate the high
pressure required by the system.
Note 2: The fuel pump relay on Motronic
systems is activated by an earth signal from
the Motronic control unit (ECU). The fuel
pump operates for a few seconds when the
ignition is first switched on, and then
continues to operate only when the engine is
2.4  Be sure to place a rag under and
around any fuel line when disconnecting


Note 3: The following checks assume the fuel
filter is in good condition. If you doubt the
condition of your fuel filter, renew it (see
Note 4: In order to get accurate test results, it
is recommended that the fuel pressure be
checked from both the main fuel pump and
transfer pump where applicable.
Fuel pump/transfer pump operational

6 Bridge the connector terminals that
correspond to the fuel pump relay pins 30 and
87b (L-Jetronic systems) or 30 and 87
(Motronic systems) with a suitable jumper wire
(see illustrations).
7 Have an assistant switch the ignition on
while you listen at the fuel tank. You should
hear a whirring sound for a couple of seconds.
Note: This test applies to the transfer pump
also. If there is no whirring sound, there is a
problem in the fuel pump circuit. Check the
fuel pump main fuse and relay first (see
Chapter 12). If the main relay is OK, test the
fuel pump relay.
Fuel system pressure check
8 Depressurise the fuel system (see Section 2).
9 Detach the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
10 Detach the fuel feed line from the fuel rail
on L-Jetronic (see illustration) and early
Motronic systems, or from the fuel filter to the
main fuel line on later Motronic systems.
11 Using a tee-piece (three-way fitting), a
short section of high-pressure fuel hose and
clamps, attach a fuel pressure gauge without
disturbing normal fuel flow (see illustration).
Warning: Do not use a plastic tee
fitting for this test. It won’t be
able to withstand the fuel system
pressure.
12 Reconnect the battery.
13 Bridge the terminals of the fuel pump
relay using a jumper wire.
14 Turn the ignition switch on.
15 Note the fuel pressure, and compare it
with the pressure listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
16 If the system fuel pressure is less than
specified:
a) Check the system for fuel leaks. Repair
any leaks found, and recheck the fuel
pressure.
b) If there are no leaks, fit a new fuel filter
and recheck the fuel pressure.
c) If the pressure is still low, check the fuel
pump pressure (see below) and the fuel
pressure regulator (see Section 18).
17 If the pressure is higher than specified,
check the fuel return line for an obstruction. If
the line is not obstructed, renew the fuel
pressure regulator.
18 Turn the ignition off, wait five minutes and
look at the gauge. Compare the reading with
the system hold pressure listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. If the hold pressure
is less than specified:
a) Check the system for fuel leaks. Repair
any leaks found, and recheck the fuel
pressure.
b) Check the fuel pump pressure (see
below).
c) Check the fuel pressure regulator (see
Section 18).
d) Check the injectors (see Section 20).
Fuel pump pressure check
Warning: For this test, a fuel
pressure gauge with a bleed
valve will be needed, in order to
relieve the high fuel pressure
safely. After the test is completed, the
normal procedure for depressurising will
not work, because the gauge is connected
directly to the fuel pump.

tions.
26 If the indicated pressure is less than
specified, inspect the fuel line for leaks
between the pump and gauge. If no leaks are
found, renew the fuel pump.
27 Turn the ignition off and wait five minutes.
Note the reading on the gauge, and compare
it to the fuel pump hold pressure listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. If the hold pressure
is less than specified, check the fuel lines
between the pump and gauge for leaks. If no
leaks are found, renew the fuel pump.

32 Reconnect the battery.
33 Using a jumper wire, bridge the terminals
of the fuel pump relay.
34 Turn the ignition switch on to operate the
fuel pump.
35 Note the pressure reading on the gauge,
and compare to the value listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications.
36 If the indicated pressure is less than
specified, renew the transfer pump.
Fuel pump relay check
37 Switch on the ignition.
38 Using a voltmeter, probe the following
terminals from the back of the relay electrical
connector. Check for battery voltage at
terminal 30 (M20 and M30 engines) or
terminal 15 (M10 and M40 engines). Note: If
there is no voltage on models with luggage
compartment-mounted batteries, check for a
faulty fusible link. The 50-amp link is about 
6 inches from the battery, in a black wire.
39 Turn the ignition off, and disconnect the
relay from the electrical connector. Using a
voltmeter, probe the connector terminals that
correspond to fuel pump relay pins 85 (-) and
86(+) on M20 and M30 engines, or terminal 50
and earth on M10 and M40 engines. Have an
assistant turn the engine over on the starter,
and observe the voltage reading. Battery
voltage should be indicated.
40 If there is no voltage, check the fuse(s)
and the wiring circuit for the fuel pump relay. If
the voltage readings are correct, and the fuel
pump only runs with the jumper wire in place,
then renew the relay.
41 If the fuel pump still does not run, check
for the proper voltage at the fuel pump
terminals (see Section 4). If necessary, renew
the fuel pump.

Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Also, don’t work
in a garage where a natural gas-type

Fuel pump (carburettor engines)
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Disconnect both hoses from the pump, and
unscrew and remove the two securing nuts
(see illustration).
2 Carefully withdraw the pump from the
cylinder head. If it’s stuck, a slight downward
tap on the thick insulating distance piece with
a piece of wood, should free it.
3 Remove the two thin gaskets.
4 The fuel pump is a sealed unit, and it is not
possible to renew any of the internal
components. Should an internal fault occur, it
must be renewed complete.
5 Refitting is a reversal of the removal
procedure, but renew the thin gaskets each
side of the insulating distance piece, and
tighten the fuel pump down evenly to the
torque stated in the Specifications. On no
account alter the thickness of the distance
piece, or the correct operation of the fuel
pump will be upset.
Fuel pump (fuel injection
engines)
Note 1: The electric fuel pump is located
inside the fuel tank on later models with the
Motronic system, or adjacent to the fuel tank
on the L-Jetronic system. The early models
are also equipped with a transfer pump
located in the fuel tank. The transfer pump
feeds the larger main pump, which delivers
the high pressure required for proper fuel
system operation.
Note 2: The fuel level sender unit is located in
the fuel tank with the transfer pump on early
models, or with the main fuel pump on later
models.

8 Raise and support the vehicle.
9 Remove the two rubber boots that protect
the fuel pump connectors, and disconnect the
wires from the pump (see illustration).
10 Using hose clamps, pinch shut the fuel
hoses on each side of the fuel pump. If you
don’t have any hose clamps, wrap the hoses
with rags, and clamp them shut with self-
locking pliers, tightened just enough to
prevent fuel from flowing out.
11 Disconnect the hoses from the pump.
12 Remove the fuel pump mounting screws

13 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
In-tank fuel pump or transfer pump
14 On some models, access to the fuel pump
is gained by removing the rear seat cushion.
On other models, access is gained by
removing the carpet from the luggage
compartment.
15 Remove the screws from the fuel pump
access cover (see illustration).
16 Remove the cover.
17 Locate the fuel pump and sender unit
electrical connectors (see illustrations) and
unplug them. Also, disconnect the fuel inlet
and return lines.
18 On some models, the assembly must be
rotated anti-clockwise to disengage the
locking lugs from the fuel tank (see
illustration). On other models, the assembly
is secured to the tank with nuts (see
illustration). Carefully lift the assembly from
the fuel tank (see illustrations). It may be
necessary to twist the assembly slightly, to
get the float to clear the opening.
19 On early models, remove the transfer
pump mounting screws and clamps, and
separate the transfer pump from the
assembly.
20 Refitting is the reverse of removal. If the
gasket between the fuel pump and fuel tank is
dried, cracked or damaged, renew it.

5 Fuel lines and fittings - 
repair and renewal 3
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, rinse it off immediately
with soap and water. When you perform
any kind of work on the fuel system, wear
safety glasses, and have a fire
extinguisher on hand.
1 Always disconnect the battery negative
cable, and (on fuel injection models)
depressurise the fuel system as described in
Section 2, before servicing fuel lines or
fittings.
2 The fuel feed, return and vapour lines
extend from the fuel tank to the engine
compartment. The lines are secured to the
underbody with clip and screw assemblies.
These lines must be occasionally inspected
for leaks, kinks and dents (see illustration).
3 If evidence of dirt is found in the system or
fuel filter during dismantling, the lines should
be disconnected and blown out. On fuel
injection models, check the fuel strainer on
the in-tank fuel pump for damage and
deterioration.
4 Because fuel lines used on fuel injection
vehicles are under high pressure, they require
special consideration. If renewal of a rigid fuel
line or emission line is called for, use welded
steel tubing meeting BMW specification or its
equivalent. Don’t use plastic, copper or
aluminium tubing to renew steel tubing. These
materials cannot withstand normal vehicle
vibration.
5 When renewing fuel hoses, be sure to use
only hoses of original-equipment standard.
6 Fuel tank - 
removal and refitting 3
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Also, don’t work
in a garage where a natural gas-type
appliance with a pilot light is present.
When you perform any kind of work on the
fuel system, wear safety glasses, and have
a fire extinguisher on hand. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, clean it off immediately
with soap and water.
Note: To avoid draining large amounts of fuel,
make sure the fuel tank is nearly empty (if
possible) before beginning this procedure.
1 Remove the fuel tank filler cap to relieve
fuel tank pressure.
2 On fuel injection models, depressurise the
fuel system (see Section 2).
3 Detach the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
4 Remove the tank drain plug (see
illustration) and drain the fuel into an
approved fuel container. If no drain plug is
fitted, it should be possible to syphon the fuel
out (not by mouth), otherwise the fuel will have
to be drained during the removal operation.
5 Unplug the fuel pump/sender unit electrical
connector (as applicable) and detach the fuel
feed, return and vapour hoses (see Section 4).
Where applicable, remove the rear seat
cushion for access.
6 Remove the fuel tank shield (see
illustration).
7 Detach the fuel filler neck and breather
hoses.
8 Raise and support the vehicle. On some
models, it will also be necessary to remove
the exhaust system and propeller shaft.

Position a block of wood between the jack
head and the fuel tank to protect the tank.
10 Remove the mounting bolts at the corners
of the fuel tank, and unbolt the retaining
down until they’re hanging out of the way.
11 Lower the tank just enough so you can
see the top, and make sure you have
detached everything. Finish lowering the tank,
and remove it from the vehicle.
12 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
7 Fuel tank cleaning and repair
- general information
1 All repairs to the fuel tank or filler neck
should be carried out by a professional who
has experience in this critical and potentially
dangerous work. Even after cleaning and
flushing of the fuel system, explosive fumes
can remain and ignite during repair of the
tank.
2 If the fuel tank is removed from the vehicle,
it should not be placed in an area where
sparks or open flames could ignite the fumes
coming out of the tank. Be especially careful
inside garages where a natural gas-type
appliance is located, because the pilot light
could cause an explosion.
8 Air cleaner assembly -
removal and refitting 1
1 Detach the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-

9 Accelerator cable - check,
adjustment and renewal 1
Check
1 Separate the air intake duct from the
throttle body (fuel injection models) or remove
the air cleaner (carburettor models).
2 Have an assistant depress the accelerator
pedal to the floor while you watch the throttle
valve. It should move to the fully-open
position.
3 Release the accelerator pedal, and make
sure the throttle valve returns smoothly to the
fully-closed position. The throttle valve should
not contact the body at any time during its
movement; if it does, the unit must be renewed.
Adjustment
4 Warm the engine to normal operating
temperature, then switch it off. Depress the
accelerator pedal to the floor twice, then
check the cable free play at the
carburettor/throttle body. Compare it to the
value listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
5 If the free play isn’t as specified, adjust it by
turning the adjustment nut (see illustration).
6 Have an assistant help you verify the
throttle valve is fully open when the
accelerator pedal is depressed to the floor.

10 Carburettor - 
general information
1 Early models are fitted with a Solex 2B4
carburettor, and later models are fitted with a
Solex 2BE carburettor. Both carburettors are
of downdraught, two-stage type. The first
stage is operated mechanically by the
accelerator pedal, and the second stage by
vacuum control.
2 Each stage has its own float chamber, float
assembly and needle valve, designed to
reduce the effects of braking and centrifugal
forces.
3 On the 2B4 version, the primary stage
choke valve is operated by an automatic
choke (a bi-metal spring which is electrically
heated) during the warm-up period. Warm-up
enrichment is also provided by a coolant-
operated thermal valve and air temperature-
controlled flow valve.
4 On the 2BE version, an electronic control
unit is used to automatically adjust the
carburettor settings during warm-up and
normal temperature operation. The control
unit is located beneath the right-hand side of
the facia.

13 Fuel injection - 
general information
The fuel injection system is composed of
three basic sub-systems: fuel system, air
intake system and electronic control system.
Fuel system
An electric fuel pump, located inside the
fuel tank or beside the fuel tank, supplies fuel
under constant pressure to the fuel rail, which
distributes fuel evenly to all injectors. From
the fuel rail, fuel is injected into the intake
ports, just above the intake valves, by the fuel
injectors. The amount of fuel supplied by the
injectors is precisely controlled by an
Electronic Control Unit (ECU). An additional
injector, known as the cold start injector (L-
Jetronic and early Motronic systems only),
supplies extra fuel into the intake manifold for
starting. A pressure regulator controls system
pressure in relation to intake manifold
vacuum. A fuel filter between the fuel pump
and the fuel rail filters the fuel, to protect the
components of the system.
Air intake system
The air intake system consists of an air filter
housing, an airflow meter, a throttle body, the
intake manifold, and the associated ducting.
The airflow meter is an information-gathering
device for the ECU. These models are
equipped with the vane-type airflow meter. A
potentiometer measures intake airflow, and a
temperature sensor measures intake air
temperature. This information helps the ECU
determine the amount of fuel to be injected by
the injectors (injection duration). The throttle
plate inside the throttle body is controlled by
the driver. As the throttle plate opens, the
amount of air that can pass through the
system increases, so the potentiometer opens
further and the ECU signals the injectors to
increase the amount of fuel delivered to the
intake ports.
Electronic control system
The computer control system controls the
fuel system and other systems by means of
an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU
receives signals from a number of information
sensors which monitor such variables as
intake air volume, intake air temperature,
coolant temperature, engine rpm,
acceleration/deceleration, and exhaust
oxygen content. These signals help the ECU
determine the injection duration necessary for
the optimum air/fuel ratio. These sensors and
their corresponding ECU-controlled output
actuators are located throughout the engine
compartment. For further information
regarding the ECU and its relationship to the
engine electrical systems and ignition system,
refer to Chapters 5 and 6.
Either an L-Jetronic system or a Motronic
system is fitted. Later models have an
updated version of the original Motronic
system.
14 Fuel injection systems
L-Jetronic fuel injection system
The Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection system
is used on most 3-Series models up to 1987,
and on most E28 (“old-shape”) 5-Series
models. It is an electronically-controlled fuel
injection system that utilises one solenoid-
operated fuel injector per cylinder. The system
is governed by an Electronic Control Unit
(ECU) which processes information sent by
various sensors, and in turn precisely 
meters the fuel to the cylinders by 
adjusting the amount of time that the injectors
are open.
An electric fuel pump delivers fuel under
high pressure to the injectors, through the fuel
feed line and an in-line filter. A pressure
regulator keeps fuel available at an optimum
pressure, allowing pressure to rise or fall
depending on engine speed and load. Any
excess fuel is returned to the fuel tank by a
separate line.
A sensor in the air intake duct constantly
measures the mass of the incoming air, and
the ECU adjusts the fuel mixture to provide an
optimum air/fuel ratio.
Other components incorporated in the
system are the throttle valve (which controls
airflow to the engine), the coolant temperature
sensor, the throttle position switch, idle
stabiliser valve (which bypasses air around
the throttle plate to control idle speed) and
associated relays and fuses.
Motronic fuel injection system
The Motronic system combines the fuel
control of the L-Jetronic fuel injection system
with the control of ignition timing, idle speed
and emissions into one control unit.
The fuel injection and idle speed control
functions are similar to those used on the L-
Jetronic system described above. For more
information on the Motronic system, see
Chapter 6.
An oxygen sensor is mounted in the
exhaust system on later models with a
catalytic converter. This sensor continually
reads the oxygen content of the exhaust gas.
The information is used by the ECU to adjust
the duration of injection, making it possible to
adjust the fuel mixture for optimum converter
efficiency and minimum emissions.
15 Fuel injection system - 
check 2
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, rinse it off immediately
with soap and water. When you perform
any kind of work on the fuel system, wear
safety glasses, and have a fire
extinguisher on hand.
1 Check the earth wire connections. Check
all wiring harness connectors that are related
to the system. Loose connectors and poor
earths can cause many problems that
resemble more serious malfunctions.
2 Make sure the battery is fully charged, as
the control unit and sensors depend on an
accurate supply voltage in order to properly
meter the fuel.
3 Check the air filter element - a dirty or
partially-blocked filter will severely impede
performance and economy (see Chapter 1).
4 If a blown fuse is found, renew it and see if
it blows again. If it does, search for an earthed
wire in the harness related to the system.
5 Check the air intake duct from the airflow
meter to the intake manifold for leaks. Intake
air leaks can cause a variety of problems. Also
check the condition of the vacuum hoses
connected to the intake manifold.
6 Remove the air intake duct from the throttle
body, and check for dirt, carbon and other
residue build-up. If it’s dirty, clean it with
carburettor cleaner and a toothbrush.
7 With the engine running, place a
screwdriver or a stethoscope against each
injector, one at a time, and listen for a clicking
sound, indicating operation (see illustration).
15.7 Use a stethoscope or screwdriver to
determine if the injectors are working
properly - they should make a steady
clicking sound that rises and falls with
engine speed changes


8 Check the fuel system pressure (see
9 If these checks do not locate the problem,
take the vehicle to a BMW dealer, who will be
able to read the fault codes stored in the ECU,
using special equipment.
16 Airflow meter - check,
removal and refitting 2
Check (L-Jetronic systems)
1 Remove the duct from the intake end of the
airflow meter. Carefully open and close the
sensor flap (see illustration), and check for
binding. The flap can bend during a backfire,
and cause incorrect resistance readings. The
flap will bind and stick in a partially-open
position, causing the engine to run rich, and
stall when it returns to idle. 
2 Disconnect the electrical connector from
the airflow meter.
3 Using an ohmmeter, check the resistance
between terminals 7 and 8 (see illustration).
The resistance should increase steadily
(without any “flat spots”) as the sensor flap is
slowly moved from the fully-closed position to
the fully-open position.
4 Also, check the intake air temperature
sensor (inside the airflow meter). Using an
ohmmeter, probe terminals 8 and 9 (see
illustration 16.3) and check for the proper
resistance. The resistance should be 2200 to
2700 ohms at 20º C.
5 If the resistance readings are correct, check
the wiring harness (see Chapter 12). Plug in
the connector to the airflow meter. Ensure
that the ignition is switched off. Disconnect
the electrical connector from the ECU (located
under the right-hand side of the facia) and
probe terminals 7 and 8 (see illustration) with
an ohmmeter. Carefully move the door of the
airflow meter, and observe the change in
resistance as it moves from closed to fully-
open. The test results should be the same as
paragraph 3. If there are any differences in the
test results, there may be a shorted-out or
broken wire in the harness.
Check (Motronic systems)
6 Ensure that the ignition is switched off.
Remove the ECU access cover (see Chap-
ter 6) and disconnect the harness connector
(see illustration).
7 Using an ohmmeter, probe the designated
terminals of the ECU electrical connector (see
illustrations) and check for the proper
change in resistance while moving the sensor
flap. On early Motronic systems, probe
terminals 7 and 9. On later Motronic systems,
probe terminals 7 and 12. The resistance
should increase steadily (without any “flat
spots”) as the sensor flap is slowly moved
from the fully-closed position to the fully-open
position. Note: Early Motronic systems are
distinguishable by the 35-pin ECU electrical
connector; later Motronic systems use a 55-
pin connector.
8 If the resistance readings are incorrect,
check the wiring harness. 
Removal and refitting (all
systems)
9 Disconnect the electrical connector from
the airflow meter.
10 Remove the air cleaner assembly (see
Section 8).
11 Remove the nuts (see illustrations), and
lift the airflow meter from the engine
compartment or from the air cleaner
assembly.
12 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
Fuel and exhaust systems  4•15
16.5  The ECU is located under the right-
hand side of the facia. Unplug the
electrical connector, and check the
resistance between terminals 7 and 8 as in
paragraph 3. The test results should be the
same.
16.3  Connect an ohmmeter to terminals 7
and 8 of the airflow meter, and check for a
smooth change in resistance as the vane
door of the airflow meter is slowly opened
and closed
16.1  Check for binding of the flap in the
airflow meter as it nears closing position
or wide-open position. Any hesitation or
binding will cause erratic idle conditions,
rich fuel mixture or poor acceleration and
throttle response (airflow meter removed
for clarity)
16.7b  Unplug the connector, connect the
ohmmeter probes to terminals 7 and 9
(early Motronic systems) and check for a
smooth change in resistance as the door
on the airflow meter is slowly opened and
closed
16.7a  Connect the ohmmeter probes to
terminals 7 and 12 (later Motronic systems)
of the ECU connector and check for a
smooth change in resistance as the door
on the airflow meter is slowly opened and
closed
16.6  Remove the under-facia panel to gain
access to the ECU on Motronic systems

17 Throttle body - check,
1 Detach the air intake duct from the throttle
body (see Section 8) and move the duct out of
2 Have an assistant depress the throttle
pedal while you watch the throttle valve.
Check that the throttle valve moves smoothly
when the throttle is moved from closed (idle
position) to fully-open (wide-open throttle).
3 If the throttle valve is not working properly,
renew the throttle body unit.
Warning: Wait until the engine is
completely cool before beginning
this procedure.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal and refitting
4 Detach the battery negative cable.
5 Detach the air intake duct from the throttle
body, and place to one side.
6 Detach the accelerator cable from the
throttle body (see Section 9).
7 Detach the cruise control cable, if applicable.
8 Clearly label all electrical connectors
(throttle position sensor, cold start injector,
idle air stabiliser, etc), then unplug them.
9 Clearly label all vacuum hoses, then detach
them.
10 Unscrew the radiator or expansion tank
cap to relieve any residual pressure in the
cooling system, then refit it. Clamp shut the
coolant hoses, then loosen the hose clamps
and detach the hoses. Be prepared for some
coolant leakage.
11 Remove the throttle body mounting nuts
(upper) and bolts (lower), and detach the
throttle body from the air intake plenum (see
illustration).
12 Cover the air intake plenum opening with
a clean cloth, to prevent dust or dirt from
entering while the throttle body is removed.
13 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure
to tighten the throttle body mounting nuts to
the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifica-
tions, and adjust the throttle cable (see
Section 9) on completion.
18 Fuel pressure regulator -
check and renewal 3
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, rinse it off immediately
with soap and water. When you perform
any kind of work on the fuel system, wear
safety glasses, and have a fire
extinguisher on hand.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery. Refer to
the information on page 0-7 at the front of
this manual before detaching the cable. 
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
1 Depressurise the fuel system (see Sec-
tion 2).
2 Detach the battery negative cable.
3 Disconnect the fuel line and connect a fuel
pressure gauge (see Section 3). Reconnect
the battery.
4 Pressurise the fuel system (refit the fuel
pump fuse and switch on the ignition), and
check for leakage around the gauge
connections.
5 Connect a vacuum pump to the fuel
pressure regulator (see illustration).
6 Run the fuel pump (see Section 3). Read the
fuel pressure gauge with vacuum applied to
the pressure regulator, and also with no
vacuum applied. The fuel pressure should
decrease as vacuum increases.
7 Stop the fuel pump and reconnect the
vacuum hose to the regulator. Start the engine
and check the fuel system pressure at idle,
comparing your reading with the value listed
in this Chapter’s Specifications. Disconnect
the vacuum hose and watch the gauge - the
pressure should jump up to maximum as soon
as the hose is disconnected.
8 If the fuel pressure is low, pinch the fuel
return line shut and watch the gauge. If the
pressure doesn’t rise, the fuel pump is
defective, or there is a restriction in the fuel
feed line. If the pressure now rises sharply,
renew the pressure regulator.
9 If the indicated fuel pressure is too high,
stop the engine, disconnect the fuel return line
and blow through it to check for a blockage. If
there is no blockage, renew the fuel pressure
regulator.
10 If the pressure doesn’t fluctuate as
described in paragraph 7, connect a vacuum

pressure regulator.
19 Cold start injector and
thermotime switch - check
and renewal
2
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, rinse it off immediately
with soap and water. When you perform
any kind of work on the fuel system, wear
safety glasses, and have a fire
extinguisher on hand.
Check
Cold start injector
1 The engine coolant should be below 30ºC
for this check. Preferably, the engine should
have been switched off for several hours.
Disconnect the electrical connector from the
cold start injector (see illustration) and move
it aside, away from the work area - there will
be fuel vapour present. Remove the two
screws holding the injector to the air intake
plenum, and take the injector out. The fuel line
must be left connected. Wipe the injector
nozzle. Disable the ignition system by
detaching the coil wire from the centre
terminal of the distributor cap, and earthing it
on the engine block with a jumper wire. Run
the fuel pump for 1 minute by bridging the
appropriate relay terminals (see Section 3).
There must be no fuel dripping from the
nozzle. If there is, the injector is faulty and
must be renewed. Switch off the ignition and
remake the original fuel pump relay
connections.
2 Now direct the nozzle of the injector into a
can or jar. Reconnect the electrical connector
to the injector. Have an assistant switch on
the ignition and operate the starter. The
injector should squirt a conical-shaped spray
into the jar (see illustration). If the spray
pattern is good, the injector is working
properly. If the spray pattern is irregular, the
injector is fouled or damaged, and should be
cleaned or renewed.
3 If the cold start injector does not spray any
fuel, check for a voltage signal at the electrical
connector for the cold start injector when the
starter motor is operated (see illustration). If
there is no voltage, check the thermotime
switch.
Thermotime switch
4 The thermotime switch detects the
temperature of the engine, and controls the
action of the cold start injector. It is usually
located up front, near the coolant temperature
sensor. The engine coolant should be below
30ºC for this check. Preferably, the engine
should have been switched off for several
hours. Disable the ignition system by detaching
the coil wire from the centre terminal of the
distributor cap, and earthing it on the engine
block with a jumper wire. Pull back the rubber
boot from the thermotime switch (see
illustration) and probe the black/yellow wire
connector terminal with a voltmeter.
5 Have an assistant switch on the ignition and
operate the starter. The voltmeter should
register a voltage signal the moment the
starter engages. This signal should last
approximately 6 to 10 seconds, depending on
the temperature of the engine.

6 If the voltage is correct, unplug the
electrical connector and, using an ohmmeter,
check for continuity between the terminals of
Continuity should exist.
7 Reconnect the coil lead, start the engine
and warm it up above 41ºC. When the engine
is warm, there should be no continuity
between the terminals. If there is, the switch is
faulty and must be renewed. Note: On 5-
Series models, there are several types of
thermotime switch. Each one is stamped with
an opening temperature and maximum
duration.
Renewal
Cold start injector
8 Depressurise the fuel system (see Sec-
tion 2).
9 Disconnect the electrical connector from
the cold start injector.
10 Where applicable, using a ring spanner or
deep socket, remove the fuel line fitting
connected to the cold start injector. On other
models, simply loosen the hose clamp and
detach the hose from the injector.
11 Remove the cold start injector securing
bolts, and remove the injector.
12 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Clean
the mating surfaces, and use a new gasket.
Thermotime switch
Warning: Wait until the engine is
completely cool before beginning
this procedure. Also, remove the
cap from the expansion tank or
radiator to relieve any residual pressure in
the cooling system.
13 Prepare the new thermotime switch for
fitting by applying a light coat of thread
sealant to the threads.
14 Disconnect the electrical connector from
the old thermotime switch.
15 Using a deep socket, or a ring spanner,
unscrew the switch. Once the switch is
removed coolant will start to leak out, so
insert the new switch as quickly as possible.
Tighten the switch securely, and plug in the
electrical connector.
20 Fuel injectors - 
check and renewal 2
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area. Don’t work in a
garage where a natural gas-type appliance
(such as a water heater or clothes dryer)
with a pilot light is present. If you spill any
fuel on your skin, rinse it off immediately
with soap and water. When you perform
any kind of work on the fuel system, wear
safety glasses, and have a fire
extinguisher on hand.
Check
In-vehicle check
1 Using a mechanic’s stethoscope (available
at most car accessory shops), check for a
clicking sound at each of the injectors while
the engine is idling (see illustration 15.7).
2 The injectors should make a steady clicking
sound if they are operating properly.
3 Increase the engine speed above 3500 rpm.
The frequency of the clicking sound should
rise with engine speed.
4 If an injector isn’t functioning (not clicking),
purchase a special injector test light (a car
accessory shop or fuel injection specialist
may be able to help) and connect it to the
injector electrical connector. Start the engine
and make sure the light flashes. If it does, the
injector is receiving the proper voltage, so the
injector itself must be faulty.
5 Unplug each injector connector, and check
the resistance of the injector (see
illustration). Check your readings with the
values listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
Renew any that do not give the correct
resistance reading.
Volume test
6 Because a special injection checker is
required to test injector volume, this
procedure is beyond the scope of the home
mechanic. Have the injector volume test
performed by a BMW dealer or other
specialist.
Renewal
7 Unplug the main electrical connector for the
fuel injector wiring harness. Remove the
intake manifold (see Chapter 2A).
8 Detach the fuel hoses from the fuel rail, and
remove the fuel rail mounting bolts (see
illustration).
9 Lift the fuel rail/injector assembly from the
intake manifold.
10 Unplug the electrical connectors from the
fuel injectors. Detach the injectors from the
fuel rail.
11 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Be sure
to renew all O-rings. Coat the O-rings with a
light film of engine oil to prevent damage
during refitting. Pressurise the fuel system
(refit the fuel pump fuse and switch on the
ignition) and check for leaks before starting
the engine.
21 Idle air stabiliser valve -
check, adjustment and
renewal
4
1 The idle air stabiliser system works to
maintain engine idle speed within a 200 rpm
range, regardless of varying engine loads at
idle. An electrically-operated valve allows a
small amount of air to bypass the throttle
plate, to raise the idle speed whenever the idle
speed drops below approximately 750 rpm. If
the idle speed rises above approximately 
950 rpm, the idle air stabiliser valve closes
and stops extra air from bypassing the throttle
plate, reducing the idle speed.

If you don’t have a
mechanic’s stethoscope, a
screwdriver can be used to
check for a clicking sound at
the injectors. Place the tip of the
screwdriver against the injector, and
press your ear against the handle.


2 L-Jetronic systems are equipped with a
separate idle speed control unit (computer)
located under the facia. The idle air stabiliser
valve has an adjusting screw. Early models
are equipped with plastic valves, but they still
can be adjusted by removing the hose and
inserting a very thin screwdriver inside.
3 Early Motronic systems are also equipped
with a separate idle speed control unit
(computer) located under the facia. The idle
air stabiliser valve has an adjusting screw.
4 On later Motronic systems, the idle air
stabiliser valve is ECU-controlled, and no
provision is made for adjustment.
Preliminary check
5 Before performing any checks on the idle
air stabiliser valve, make sure these criteria
are met:
a) The engine must be at operating
temperature (60ºC)
b) Turn off all electrical accessories (air
conditioning, heater controls, headlights,
auxiliary cooling fan, etc)
c) The throttle position sensor must be
operating correctly (see Chapter 6)
d) There must not be any exhaust leaks
e) There must not be any vacuum leaks
f) Where fitted, the oxygen sensor must be
operating properly (see Chapter 6)
6 Connect a tachometer in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Caution: The ignition must be
switched off before making any
electrical connections.
7 The idle air stabiliser valve operates
continuously when the ignition is on. Start the
engine and make sure the valve is vibrating
and humming slightly.
L-Jetronic system
Check
8 With the engine running, disconnect the
electrical connector from the valve. The idle
speed should increase to about 2,000 rpm.
9 If the idle speed does not increase, turn the
engine off. Using an ohmmeter, check the
resistance across the terminals of the valve
(see illustration). It should be 9 to 10 ohms
with the ambient air temperature at about 
20º C.
10 Using a pair of jumper wires, apply battery
voltage to the valve, and confirm that the
valve closes tightly. When the voltage is
removed, the valve should re-open.
11 If the idle air stabiliser valve fails any of
the tests, renew it.
12 If the idle air stabiliser valve passes the
tests, check the control current.
13 Unplug the electrical connector from the
valve. Using a jumper wire, connect one
terminal of the electrical connector to one of
the terminals on the valve, Connect an
ammeter (0 to 1000 mA range) between the
other terminal on the electrical connector and
the remaining terminal on the valve. Start the
engine and allow it to idle. With the engine
running, the current reading should be
between 400 and 500 mA. Adjust the valve if
the current reading is not as specified (see
paragraph 15). Note: The idle air stabiliser
current will fluctuate between 400 and 
1100 mA if the engine is too cold, if the
coolant temperature sensor is faulty, if the idle
speed needs to be adjusted, if there is an
engine vacuum leak or if electrical accessories
are on.
14 If there is no current reading, have the idle
speed control unit diagnosed by a BMW
dealer or other specialist. Note: The idle air
stabiliser control unit (located under the facia)
can develop an electrical connector problem
that intermittently turns the valve on and off.
Check the connector very carefully before
fitting any new parts. Sometimes, a new
control unit will only fix the problem
temporarily.
Adjustment
15 With the ignition switched off, connect a
tachometer in accordance with the equipment
manufacturer’s instructions.
16 Make sure the ignition timing is correct
(see Chapter 5).
17 Connect an ammeter to the valve (see
paragraph 13).
18 With the engine running, the current
reading should be 450 to 470 mA at 850 to
900 rpm (manual transmission), or 460 to 
480 mA at 850 to 900 rpm (automatic
transmission).
19 If the control current is not correct, turn
the adjusting screw until it is within the correct
range (see illustration). Note: On metal-type
valves, the adjusting screw is mounted
externally. On plastic-type valves, the
adjustment screw is inside, and can be
reached by removing the hose at the end of
the valve.
Motronic systems
Check
Note: There are two types of idle air stabiliser
valve on these systems; early models usually
have a two-wire valve, while later models are
equipped with a three-wire valve.
20 With the engine running, disconnect the
electrical connector from the valve. The idle
speed should increase to about 2000 rpm.
21 If the idle speed does not increase:
a) Two-wire valve - Using a pair of jumper
wires, apply battery voltage to the valve,
and confirm that the valve closes tightly.
When the voltage is removed, the valve
should re-open. Also, check the
resistance of the valve (see illus-
tration 21.9). The resistance should be
about 9 or 10 ohms.
b) Three-wire valve - Turn the engine off and
unplug the electrical connector from the
valve. Using an ohmmeter, check the
resistance on the two outer terminals of
the valve. (see illustration). It should be
about 40 ohms. Check the resistance on
the centre and outside terminals of the
valve. They should both be about 
20 ohms.
22 If the idle air stabiliser valve fails any of
the tests, renew it.
23 If the idle air stabiliser valve tests are all
correct, check the control current (two-wire
valve) or the voltage (three-wire valve) as
follows.
24 On two-wire valves, connect an ammeter
(0 to 1000 mA range) as described in
paragraph 13. Start the engine, and allow it to
idle. With the engine running, the current

reading should be between 400 and 500 mA.
Adjust the valve if the current reading is not as
specified. Note: The idle air stabiliser current
will fluctuate between 400 and 1100 mA if the
engine is too cold, if the coolant temperature
sensor is faulty, if there is an engine vacuum
leak, or if electrical accessories are on.
25 If there is no current reading, have the idle
speed control unit (under the facia) checked
by a BMW dealer or other specialist.
26 On three-wire valves, check for voltage at
the electrical connector. With the ignition on,
there should be battery voltage present at the
centre terminal (see illustration). There
should be about 10 volts between the centre
terminal and each of the outer terminals.
27 If there is no voltage reading, have the idle
speed control unit (early models) or the ECU
(later models) checked by a dealer service
department or other specialist.
Adjustment (early models only)
28 With the ignition switched off, connect a
tachometer in accordance with the equipment
manufacturer’s instructions.
29 Make sure the ignition timing is correct
(see Chapter 5).
30 Connect an ammeter to the valve as
described in paragraph 13.
31 With the engine running, the current draw
should be 450 to 470 mA at 700 to 750 rpm.
32 If the control current is not correct, turn
the adjusting screw until it is within the
specified range. Note: Turn the idle air bypass
screw clockwise to increase the current, or
anti-clockwise to decrease the current.
Renewal
33 Remove the electrical connector and the
bracket from the idle air stabiliser valve.
Remove the valve, disconnecting the hoses.
34 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
22 Exhaust system servicing -
general information
Warning: Inspect or repair
exhaust system components only
when the system is completely
cool. When working under the
vehicle, make sure it is securely
supported.
Silencer and pipes
1 The exhaust system consists of the exhaust
manifold, catalytic converter, silencers, and all
connecting pipes, brackets, mountings (see
illustration) and clamps. The exhaust system
is attached to the body with brackets and
rubber mountings. If any of the parts are
improperly fitted, excessive noise and
vibration may be transmitted to the body.
2 Inspect the exhaust system regularly. Look
for any damaged or bent parts, open seams,
holes, loose connections, excessive
corrosion, or other defects which could allow
exhaust fumes to enter the vehicle. Generally,
deteriorated exhaust system components
cannot be satisfactorily repaired; they should
be renewed.
3 If the exhaust system components are
extremely corroded or rusted together, it may
be necessary to cut off the old components
with a hacksaw. Be sure to wear safety
goggles to protect your eyes from metal
chips, and wear work gloves to protect your
hands.
4 Here are some simple guidelines to follow
when repairing the exhaust system:
a) Work from the back to the front of the
vehicle when removing exhaust system
components.
b) Apply penetrating oil to the exhaust
system nuts and bolts to make them
easier to remove.
c) Use new gaskets, mountings and clamps
when fitting exhaust system components.
d) Apply anti-seize compound to the threads
of all exhaust system nuts and bolts
during reassembly.
e) Be sure to allow sufficient clearance
between newly-fitted parts and all points
on the underbody, to avoid overheating
the floorpan, and possibly damaging the
interior carpet and insulation. Pay
particularly close attention to the catalytic
converters and heat shields. Also, make
sure that the exhaust will not come into
contact with suspension parts, etc.
Catalytic converter
5 Although the catalytic converter is an
emissions-related component, it is discussed
here because, physically, it’s an integral part
of the exhaust system. Always check the
converter whenever you raise the vehicle to
inspect or service the exhaust system.
6 Raise and support the vehicle.
7 Inspect the catalytic converter for cracks or
damage.
8 Check the converter connections for
tightness.
9 Check the insulation covers welded onto the
catalytic converter for damage or a loose fit.
Caution: If an insulation cover is
dented so that it touches the
converter housing inside,
excessive heat may be
transferred to the floor.
10 Start the engine and run it at idle speed.
Check all converter connections for exhaust
gas leakage.

1 General information
Engine cooling system
All vehicles covered by this manual employ
a pressurised engine cooling system, with
thermostatically-controlled coolant circulation.
An impeller-type water pump mounted on
the front of the block pumps coolant through
the engine. The coolant flows around each
cylinder, and towards the rear of the engine.
Cast-in coolant passages direct coolant
around the intake and exhaust ports, near the
spark plug areas, and in close proximity to the
exhaust valve guides.
A wax-pellet-type thermostat is located in-
line in the bottom hose on M10 engines, in a
housing near the front of the engine on M20
and M30 engines, or behind an elbow under
the timing belt upper cover (on the front of the
cylinder head) on M40 engines. During warm-
up, the closed thermostat prevents coolant
from circulating through the radiator. As the
engine nears normal operating temperature,
the thermostat opens and allows hot coolant
to travel through the radiator, where it’s
cooled before returning to the engine.
The pressure in the system raises the
boiling point of the coolant, and increases the
cooling efficiency of the radiator. The cooling
system is sealed by a pressure-type cap. If
the system pressure exceeds the cap
pressure relief value, the excess pressure in
the system forces the spring-loaded valve
inside the cap off its seat, and allows the
coolant to escape through the overflow tube.
The pressure cap on four-cylinder models is
on the top of the radiator; on six-cylinder models,
it’s on top of a translucent plastic expansion
tank. The cap pressure rating is moulded into the
top of the cap. The pressure rating is either 
1.0 bar (14 psi) or 1.2 bars (17 psi).


Warning: Do not remove the
pressure cap from the radiator or
expansion tank until the engine
has cooled completely and
there’s no pressure remaining in the
cooling system. Removing the cap from a
hot engine risks personal injury by
scalding.
Heating system
The heating system consists of a blower fan
and heater matrix located in the heater box,
with hoses connecting the heater matrix to the
engine cooling system, and the heater/air
conditioning control head on the dashboard.
Hot engine coolant is circulated through the
heater matrix passages all the time the engine
is running. Switching the heater on opens a
flap door to direct air through the heater
matrix, and the warmed air enters the
passenger compartment. A fan switch on the
control head activates the blower motor,
which forces more air through the heater
matrix, giving additional heater output for
demisting, etc.
Air conditioning system
The air conditioning system consists of a
condenser mounted in front of the radiator, an
evaporator mounted adjacent to the heater
matrix, a compressor mounted on the engine,
a filter-drier (receiver-drier) which contains a
high-pressure relief valve, and the plumbing
connecting all of the above components.
A blower fan forces the warmer air of the
passenger compartment through the
evaporator matrix (a radiator-in-reverse),
transferring the heat from the air to the
refrigerant. The liquid refrigerant boils off into
low-pressure vapour, taking the heat with it
when it leaves the evaporator.
Note: Refer to the precautions at the start
of Section 12 concerning the potential
dangers associated with the air conditioning
system.
2 Antifreeze - 
general information
Warning: Do not allow antifreeze
to come in contact with your skin
or painted surfaces of the
vehicle. Rinse off spills
immediately with plenty of water. If
consumed, antifreeze can be fatal;
children and pets are attracted by its
sweet taste, so wipe up garage floor and
drip pan coolant spills immediately. Keep
antifreeze containers covered, and repair
leaks in your cooling system as soon as
they are noticed.
The cooling system should be filled with a
60/40% water/ethylene-glycol-based anti-
freeze solution, which will prevent freezing
down to approximately -27°C (-17°F). The
antifreeze also raises the boiling point of the
coolant, and (if of good quality) provides
protection against corrosion.
The cooling system should be drained,
flushed and refilled at the specified intervals
(see Chapter 1). Old or contaminated
antifreeze solutions are likely to cause
damage, and encourage the formation of rust
and scale in the system. Use distilled water
with the antifreeze, if available, or clean
rainwater. Tap water will do, but not if the
water in your area is at all “hard”.
Before adding antifreeze, check all hose
connections, because antifreeze tends to
search out and leak through very minute
openings. Engines don’t normally consume
coolant, so if the level goes down, find the
cause and correct it.
The antifreeze mixture should be
maintained at its correct proportions; adding
too much antifreeze reduces the efficiency of
the cooling system. If necessary, consult the
mixture ratio chart on the antifreeze container
before adding coolant. Hydrometers are
available at most car accessory shops to test
the coolant. Use antifreeze which meets the
vehicle manufacturer’s specifications.
3 Thermostat - 
check and renewal 1
Warning: Do not remove the
radiator cap, drain the coolant, or
renew the thermostat until the
engine has cooled completely.
Check
1 Before assuming the thermostat is to blame
for a cooling system problem, check the
coolant level, drivebelt tension (see Chapter 1)
and temperature gauge (or warning light)
operation.
2 If the engine seems to be taking a long time
to warm up (based on heater output or
temperature gauge operation), the thermostat
is probably stuck open. Renew the
thermostat.
3 If the engine runs hot, use your hand to
check the temperature of the upper radiator
hose. If the hose isn’t hot, but the engine is,
the thermostat is probably stuck closed,
preventing the coolant inside the engine from
circulating to the radiator. Renew the
thermostat. 
Caution: Don’t drive the vehicle
without a thermostat. The engine
will be very slow to warm-up in
cold conditions, resulting in poor
fuel economy and driveability. A new
thermostat is normally an inexpensive
component anyway.
4 If the upper radiator hose is hot, it means
that the coolant is flowing and the thermostat
is at least partly open. Consult the “Fault
finding” Section at the rear of this manual for
cooling system diagnosis.
Renewal
All models
5 Disconnect the negative cable from the
battery. 
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
6 Drain the cooling system (see Chapter 1). If
the coolant is relatively new or in good
condition, save it and re-use it.
M10 engines
7 The thermostat is located in the bottom
hose. First remove the cooling fan.
8 Note the fitted position of the thermostat,
then unscrew the hose clamps and withdraw
the thermostat from the hose connections
(see illustration).
9 Refit the thermostat-to-hose connections,
and tighten the hose clamps.
10 Refit the cooling fan.
M20 and M30 engines
11 Loosen the hose clamp (see illustration),
then detach the hose(s) from the thermostat
cover.
3•2 Cooling, heating and air conditioning systems
3.11  On M20 and M30 engine models,
loosen the hose clamp (A) and disconnect
the hose from the thermostat housing
cover - note that the coolant temperature
sender unit (barely visible behind the fuel
pressure regulator) is located at the top of
the thermostat housing (B)
3.8  On the M10 (four-cylinder) engine, the
thermostat (arrowed) is connected in-line
in the radiator hose


12 If the outer surface of the fitting that
mates with the hose is deteriorated (corroded,
pitted, etc.), it may be damaged further by
hose removal. If it is, a new thermostat
housing cover will be required.
13 Remove the bolts and detach the housing
cover. If the cover is stuck, tap it with a soft-
faced hammer to jar it loose. Be prepared for
some coolant to spill as the gasket seal is
broken.
14 Note how it’s fitted, then remove the
thermostat.
15 Stuff a rag into the engine opening, then
remove all traces of old gasket material (if the
gasket is paper type). Otherwise, remove the
rubber O-ring (see illustration) and sealant
from the housing and cover with a gasket
scraper. Remove the rag from the opening
and clean the gasket mating surfaces.
16 Fit the new thermostat and gasket in the
housing. Make sure the correct end faces out
- the spring end is normally directed towards
the engine.
17 Refit the cover and bolts. Tighten the
bolts to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
M40 engines
18 Remove the cooling fan and timing belt
upper cover.
19 Unscrew the hose clamp and detach the
bottom hose from the elbow on the front of
the cylinder head.
20 Unbolt the elbow from the cylinder head.
Note the fitted position of the thermostat, then
remove it (see illustrations). Remove the
rubber O-ring; a new one will be needed for
reassembly.
21 Locate the thermostat in the cylinder head
in the same position as noted during removal
(arrow pointing upwards).
22 Press a new O-ring in the groove, and
locate the elbow on the cylinder head. Tighten
the bolts.
23 Connect the bottom hose to the elbow,
and tighten the hose clamp.
24 Refit the upper timing belt cover and
cooling fan.
All models
25 Refill the cooling system (see Chapter 1).
26 Connect the battery negative cable.
27 Start the engine and allow it to reach
normal operating temperature, then check for
leaks and proper thermostat operation (as
described earlier in this Section).
4 Radiator - 
removal and refitting 1
Warning: Wait until the engine is
completely cool before beginning
this procedure.
Note: If the radiator is being removed because
it is leaking, note that minor leaks can often be
repaired without removing the radiator, using
a radiator sealant.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable. 
2 Drain the cooling system (see Chapter 1). If
the coolant is relatively new, or in good
condition, save it and re-use it.
3 Loosen the hose clamps, then detach the
hoses from the radiator (see illustrations). If
they’re stuck, grasp each hose near the end
with a pair of water pump pliers, twist gently
to break the seal, then pull off - be careful not
to distort or break the radiator outlets! If the
hoses are old or deteriorated, cut them off
and refit new ones.
4 On M20 and M30 engines, disconnect the
reservoir hose from the radiator filler neck.
5 Remove the screws or plastic fasteners that
attach the shroud to the radiator, and slide the
shroud towards the engine (see illustration).
On some engines it is possible to completely
remove the shroud.

the radiator (see illustration). The thermo-
statically-controlled switches for high- and
low-speed operation of the auxiliary fan are
located in the radiator tanks, in various
locations depending on engine and model.
8 Remove the radiator mounting bolt(s). The
mountings are either on the top or sides of the
radiator (see illustration).
9 Carefully lift out the radiator from the
bottom mountings, taking care not to damage
the cooling fins. Don’t spill coolant on the
vehicle, or scratch the paint.
10 With the radiator removed, it can be
inspected for leaks and damage. If it needs
repair, have a specialist perform the work, as
special techniques are required.
11 Flies and dirt can be removed from the
radiator with compressed air and a soft brush.
Don’t bend the cooling fins as this is done.
12 Check the radiator mountings for
deterioration, and renew if necessary (see
illustration).
Refitting
13 Refitting is the reverse of the removal
procedure.
14 After refitting, fill the cooling system with
the proper mixture of antifreeze and water.
Refer to Chapter 1 if necessary.
15 Start the engine and check for leaks.
Allow the engine to reach normal operating
temperature, indicated by the upper radiator
hose becoming hot. Recheck the coolant
level, and add more if required.
16 If you’re working on an automatic
transmission model, check and add
transmission fluid as needed.
5 Engine cooling fan(s) and
clutch - check, removal and
refitting
1
Warning: To avoid possible injury
or damage, DO NOT operate the
engine with a damaged fan. Do
not attempt to repair fan blades -
fit a new fan. Also, the electric auxiliary fan
in front of the radiator or air conditioning
condenser can come on without the
engine running or ignition being on. It is
controlled by the coolant temperature of
the thermo-switches located in the
radiator.
Check
Electric auxiliary fan
Note : This fan on most models is controlled
by two thermo-switches placed in the radiator:
one for low-speed/low-temperature operation,
and one for high-speed/high-temperature
operation. Each switch comes on at a different
coolant temperature (refer to the Specifica-
tions at the beginning of this Chapter). 
1 The thermostatically-controlled switches for
high- and low-speed operation of the auxiliary
fan are fitted in various locations in the
radiator (see illustration 4.7), depending on
engine or model. Two single switches, or one
dual switch, may be fitted.
2 Insert a small screwdriver into the
connector to lift the lock tab, and unplug the
fan wire harness.
3 To test the fan motor, unplug the electrical
connector at the motor, and use jumper wires
to connect the fan directly to the battery. If the
fan doesn’t work when connected directly to
the battery, the motor is proved faulty, and
must be renewed. If the fan works, there’s a
good chance the switch is malfunctioning. To
more accurately diagnose the problem, follow
the steps that apply to your model. Note: Spin
the auxiliary fan motor by hand, to check that
the motor or fan isn’t binding. Make sure,
however, that the engine is sufficiently cool
that there is no danger of the fan cutting-in on
its own when this is done.
4 To test the low-speed and high-speed
circuits, disconnect the electrical connector
from one of the fan switches, and bridge the
terminals of the switch’s electrical connector
with a short piece of wire. The fan should run
at low or high speed, depending on which
switch has been disconnected. On some
models the ignition must be on before the fan
will run.
5 Repeat the test at the other switch so that
both high and low speeds are tested.
6 If the low-speed and high-speed circuits
are OK, but there has been a problem with the
fan not operating correctly in service, renew
the switch (or switches). To remove a switch,
drain the coolant below the level of the switch
(see Chapter 1), then unscrew the switch and
screw in the new one. Refill the system with
coolant.
7 If the switches are satisfactory, but the
motor still does not operate, the problem lies
in the fuse, the relay, the wiring which
connects the components (or the fan motor
itself). Carefully check the fuse, relay, all
wiring and connections. See Chapter 12 for
more information on how to carry out these
checks.
Mechanical fan with viscous clutch
8 Disconnect the battery negative cable, and
rock the fan back and forth by hand to check
for excessive bearing play. 
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
9 With the engine cold, turn the fan blades by
hand. The fan should turn with slight
resistance.
10 Visually inspect for substantial fluid
leakage from the fan clutch assembly. If
problems are noted, renew the fan clutch
assembly.
11 With the engine completely warmed up,
turn off the ignition switch and disconnect the
battery negative cable. Turn the fan by hand.
Heavier resistance should be evident. If the
fan turns easily, a new fan clutch may be
needed.
Removal and refitting
Electric auxiliary fan
12 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
13 To remove the auxiliary fan follow the
procedure that applies to your vehicle.
3•4 Cooling, heating and air conditioning systems
4.12  When the radiator is out, the radiator
mountings can be inspected - check for
signs of deterioration, and renew them, if
needed
4.8  The radiator is bolted to the front
panel at either the sides or the top of the
4.7  Sensors that control the high- and
low-speed operation of the auxiliary

14 Remove the radiator grille assembly (see
15 Unbolt and remove the fan bracket and
shroud assembly from the radiator (see
16 Remove the radiator (see Section 4).
17 Unbolt the air conditioning condenser
mounting bolts, where applicable. Do not
remove the condenser or disconnect any
refrigerant lines from the condenser.
18 Carefully pull the condenser back towards
the engine, slightly, to gain access to lift the
auxiliary fan.
19 Disconnect the fan motor electrical
connection and remove the auxiliary fan.
20 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
5-Series models
21 Remove the screws and trim panel in front
of the radiator.
22 Unbolt the fan assembly from the
condenser mounting points.
23 Disconnect the fan electrical connector.
24 Remove the fan and housing from the car,
being careful not to damage the air
conditioning condenser (when applicable)
while removing the fan.
25 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
Mechanical fan with viscous clutch
26 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Remove the fan shroud mounting screws or
plastic fasteners, and detach the shroud (see
Section 4).
27 Use a 32 mm open-ended spanner to
remove the fan/clutch assembly. Place the
spanner on the large nut ahead of the pulley
(see illustrations), and tap the end of the
spanner to loosen the nut. 
Caution: The nut has left-handed
threads, so it loosens by being
turned clockwise, as viewed from
the front of the vehicle.
28 Lift the fan/clutch assembly (and shroud,
if necessary) out of the engine compartment.
29 If necessary, remove the four bolts
attaching the pulley to the water pump hub.
The pulley can then be removed after
removing the drivebelt(s) (see illustration).
30 Carefully inspect the fan blades for
damage and defects. Renew it if necessary.
31 At this point, the fan may be unbolted
from the clutch, if necessary. If the fan clutch
is stored, position it with the radiator side
facing down.
32 Refitting is the reverse of removal.
6 Water pump - check 1
1 A failure in the water pump can cause
serious engine damage due to overheating.
2 There are two ways to check the operation
of the water pump while it’s fitted on the
engine. If either of the following checks
suggest that the pump is defective, a new one
should be fitted.
3 Water pumps are equipped with “weep” or
“vent” holes. If a failure occurs in the pump
seal, coolant will leak from the hole. In most
cases, you’ll need a torch to find the hole on
the water pump from underneath to check for
leaks.
4 If the water pump shaft bearings fail, there
may be a howling sound at the front of the
engine while it’s running. Shaft wear can be
felt if the water pump pulley is rocked up and
down (with the drivebelt removed). Don’t
mistake drivebelt slippage, which causes a
squealing sound, for water pump bearing
failure. Alternator bearing failure can also
cause a howling sound, but after removing the
drivebelt(s) it should be easy enough to tell
which component is responsible.
7 Water pump - 
removal and refitting 2
Warning: Wait until the engine is
completely cool before beginning
this procedure.
Caution: If the radio in your

20 Compare the new pump to the old one, to
make sure they’re identical.
21 Remove all traces of old gasket material
from the engine with a gasket scraper.
22 Clean the water pump mating surfaces.
23 On the M40 engine, locate a new O-ring
on the pump (see illustration).
24 Locate the gasket on the pump, and offer
the pump up to the engine (see illustration).
Slip a couple of bolts through the pump
mounting holes to hold the gasket in place.
25 Carefully attach the pump and gasket to
the engine, threading the bolts into the holes
finger-tight. Note: On the M20 engine, refit the
lower bolt finger-tight, then rotate the water
pump into position with the drivebelt tensioner
spring and pin in position.
26 Refit the remaining bolts (if they also hold
an accessory bracket in place, be sure to
reposition the bracket at this time). Tighten
them to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications, in quarter-turn increments.
Don’t overtighten them, or the pump may be
distorted.
27 Refit all parts removed for access to the
pump.
28 Refill the cooling system and check the
drivebelt tension (see Chapter 1). Run the
engine and check for leaks.
8 Coolant temperature sender
unit - check and renewal 2
Warning: Wait until the engine is
completely cool before beginning
this procedure.
1 The coolant temperature indicator system
is composed of a temperature gauge
mounted in the instrument panel, and a
coolant temperature sender unit that’s
normally mounted on the thermostat housing
(see illustration 3.11). Some vehicles have
more than one sender unit, but only one is
used for the temperature gauge. On the M40
engine, the sender unit is mounted on the left-
hand side of the cylinder head, towards the
rear.
2 If the gauge reading is suspect, first check
the coolant level in the system. Make sure the
wiring between the gauge and the sending
unit is secure, and that all fuses are intact. (If
the fuel gauge reading is suspect as well, the
problem is almost certainly in the instrument
panel or its wiring.)
3 Before testing the circuit, refer to the
relevant wiring diagrams (see Chapter 12).
Where the sender unit simply earths out the
circuit, test by earthing the wire connected to
the sending unit while the ignition is on (but
without the engine running, for safety). If the
gauge now deflects to the end of the scale,
renew the sender unit. If the gauge does not
respond satisfactorily, the gauge, or the wiring
to the gauge, is faulty. Where the sender unit
has two terminals, test the circuit by checking
the resistance of the unit. No figures were
available at the time of writing, but typically
readings of several hundred or several
thousand ohms (depending on temperature)
would be expected. A reading of zero (short-
circuit) or infinity (open-circuit) would indicate
a faulty sender unit.
Caution: Do not earth the wire
for more than a second or two, or
damage to the gauge could
occur.

4 If a new sender unit is to be fitted, make
sure the engine is completely cool. There will
be some coolant loss when the unit is
unscrewed, so be prepared to catch it, or
have the new unit ready to fit immediately the
old one is removed. Disconnect the wiring,
then unscrew the old unit from the engine,
and fit the new one. Use sealant on the
threads. Reconnect the wiring, and check the
coolant level on completion.
9 Heater and air conditioning
blower motor - removal,
testing and refitting 
1
Removal
Note: The 3-Series models covered by this
manual have always used a single blower
motor for ventilation, heating and air
conditioning. “Old-shape” (E28) 5-Series
models use two separate blower motors: one
for ventilation and heating, and another for air
conditioning. “New-shape” (E34) 5-Series
models have a single blower motor, like the 3-
Series. The removal and refitting of the single
blower motor, and the old-shape 5-Series
vent/heat motor, is described below. The
removal and refitting of the old-shape 5-Series
air conditioning blower motor is described in
Section 14 of this Chapter.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you have
the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable. 
2 The blower motor is located behind the
bulkhead, under an access panel. Remove the
panel securing screws (see illustrations).
3 Disconnect or cut the plastic ties holding
the wiring harness to the panel, and move the
wiring out of the way.
4 Remove the panel. 
5 Unclip the blower housing retaining clip,
and the clip securing the blower motor (see
illustrations).
6 Disconnect the wiring and remove the
blower motor (see illustration).
Testing
7 You can test the blower motor by applying
battery voltage to the blower motor’s
terminals with fused jumper wires (be sure the
fan blades won’t hit anything when they
rotate). If the blower motor spins the fan
blades rapidly (this test simulates high-speed
operation), the blower motor is OK. If the
blower motor does not operate, or operates
slowly or noisily, renew it.
Note: If the fan blade assemblies need to be
removed, mark their relationship to the shaft.
The assemblies are balanced during
production, and excessive noise or shortened
bearing life could result if they are not refitted
in exactly the same position in relation to the
shaft.
Refitting
8 Refitting is the reverse of removal. Note:
The blower motor may have to be rotated to
allow the retaining clip to line up correctly.

12 Air conditioning system -
precautions and maintenance 1
Precautions
Warning: The air conditioning
system is under high pressure.
DO NOT loosen any hose or line
fittings, or remove any
components, until after the system has
been discharged. Air conditioning
refrigerant should be properly discharged
by a qualified refrigeration engineer. The
refrigerant used in the system must not be
allowed into contact with your skin or
eyes, or there is a risk of frostbite. Should
the refrigerant come into contact with a
naked flame, a poisonous gas will be
produced. Smoking in the presence of
refrigerant is therefore highly dangerous,
particularly if refrigerant vapour is inhaled
through a lighted cigarette. The refrigerant
is heavier than air, and it may cause
suffocation if discharged in an enclosed
space such as a domestic garage. 
Finally, uncontrolled release of the
refrigerant causes environmental damage,
by contributing to the “greenhouse
effect”.
Maintenance
1 The following maintenance checks should
be performed on a regular basis to ensure the
air conditioner continues to operate at peak
efficiency:
a) Check the drivebelt. If it’s worn or
deteriorated, renew it (see Chapter 1).
b) Check the system hoses. Look for cracks,
bubbles, hard spots and deterioration.
Inspect the hoses and all fittings for oil
bubbles and seepage. If there’s any
evidence of wear, damage or leaks, have
new hose(s) fitted.
c) Inspect the condenser fins for leaves, flies
and other debris. Use a “fin comb” or
compressed air to clean the condenser.
d) Make sure the system has the correct
refrigerant charge, as described below.
2 It’s a good idea to operate the system for
about 10 minutes at least once a month,
particularly during the winter. Long-term non-
use can cause hardening, and subsequent
failure, of the seals.
3 Because of the complexity of the air
conditioning system and the special
equipment necessary to service it, in-depth
fault diagnosis and repair procedures are not
included in this manual. However, simple
checks and component renewal procedures
are provided in this Chapter.
4 The most common cause of poor cooling is
simply a low system refrigerant charge. If a
noticeable loss of cool air output occurs, the
following quick check may help you determine
if the refrigerant level is low.
5 Warm the engine up to normal operating
temperature.
6 Set the air conditioning temperature
selector at the coldest setting, and put the
blower at the highest setting. Open the doors
(to make sure the air conditioning system
doesn’t switch off as soon as it cools the
passenger compartment).
7 With the compressor engaged - the
compressor clutch will make an audible click,
and the centre of the clutch will rotate - feel
the tube located adjacent to the right front
frame rail, near the radiator.
8 If a significant temperature drop is noticed,
the refrigerant level is probably OK.
9 If the inlet line has frost accumulation, or
feels cooler than the receiver-drier surface,
the refrigerant charge is low. Recharging the
system should be carried out by a qualified
refrigeration engineer.
13 Air conditioning compressor

Warning: Due to the potential
dangers associated with the
system, you are strongly advised
to have any work on the air
conditioning system carried out by a BMW
dealer or air conditioning specialist. At the
very least, DO NOT dismantle any part of
the system (hoses, compressor, line
fittings, etc.) until after the system has
been discharged by a qualified engineer.
Refer to the precautions given at the start
of Section 12.
Note: If a new compressor is fitted, the
receiver-drier (see Section 16) should also be

2B•4 General engine overhaul procedures
Included in this Part of Chapter 2 are the
general overhaul procedures for the cylinder
head and engine internal components.
The information ranges from advice
concerning preparation for an overhaul and
the purchase of new parts to detailed,
paragraph-by-paragraph procedures covering
removal and refitting of internal components
and the inspection of parts.
The following Sections have been written
based on the assumption that the engine has
been removed from the vehicle. For
information concerning in-vehicle engine
repair, as well as removal and refitting of the
external components necessary for the
overhaul, see Chapter 2A, and Section 7 of
this Part.
The Specifications included in this Part are
only those necessary for the inspection and
overhaul procedures which follow. Refer to
Part A for additional Specifications.
2 Engine overhaul - 
general information
It’s not always easy to determine when, or
if, an engine should be completely
overhauled, as a number of factors must be
considered.
High mileage is not necessarily an
indication that an overhaul is needed, while
low mileage doesn’t preclude the need for an
overhaul. Frequency of servicing is probably
the most important consideration. An engine
that’s had regular and frequent oil and filter
changes, as well as other required
maintenance, will most likely give many
thousands of miles of reliable service.
Conversely, a neglected engine may require
an overhaul very early in its life.
Excessive oil consumption is an indication
that piston rings, valve seals and/or valve
guides are in need of attention. Make sure
that oil leaks aren’t responsible before
deciding that the rings and/or guides are
worn. Perform a cylinder compression check
to determine the extent of the work required
(see Section 3).
Check the oil pressure: Unscrew the oil
pressure sender unit, and connect an oil
pressure gauge in its place. Measure the oil
pressure with the engine at its normal
operating temperature. Compare your
readings to the oil pressures listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. If the readings are
significantly below these (and if the oil and oil
filter are in good condition), the crankshaft
bearings and/or the oil pump are probably
worn out. On M10 and M30 engines, the oil
pressure sender unit is located high on the left
rear of the cylinder head. On M20 engines, the
sender unit is threaded into the side of the
engine block, below the oil filter. On M40
engines, the sender unit is threaded into the
rear of the oil filter housing.
Loss of power, rough running, knocking or
metallic engine noises, excessive valve train
noise and high fuel consumption may also
point to the need for an overhaul, especially if
they’re all present at the same time. If a
complete tune-up doesn’t remedy the
situation, major mechanical work is the only
solution.
An engine overhaul involves restoring the
internal parts to the specifications of a new
engine. During an overhaul, new piston rings
are fitted and the cylinder walls are
reconditioned (rebored and/or honed). If a
rebore is done by an engineering works, new
oversize pistons will also be fitted. The main
bearings and connecting big-end bearings are
generally renewed and, if necessary, the
crankshaft may be reground to restore the
journals. Generally, the valves are serviced as
well, since they’re usually in less-than-perfect
condition at this point. While the engine is
being overhauled, other components, such as
the distributor, starter and alternator, can be
rebuilt as well. The end result should be a like-
new engine that will give many thousands of
trouble-free miles. Note: Critical cooling
system components such as the hoses,
drivebelts, thermostat and water pump MUST
be renewed when an engine is overhauled.
The radiator should be checked carefully, to
ensure that it isn’t clogged or leaking (see
Chapters 1 or 3). Also, we don’t recommend
overhauling the oil pump - always fit a new
one when an engine is rebuilt.
Before beginning the engine overhaul, read
through the entire procedure to familiarise
yourself with the scope and requirements of
the job. Overhauling an engine isn’t difficult if
you follow all of the instructions carefully,
have the necessary tools and equipment and
pay close attention to all specifications;
however, it is time consuming. Plan on the
vehicle being tied up for a minimum of two
weeks, especially if parts must be taken to an
automotive machine shop for repair or recon-
ditioning. Check on availability of parts and
make sure that any necessary special tools
and equipment are obtained in advance. Most
work can be done with typical hand tools,
although a number of precision measuring
tools are required for inspecting parts to
determine if they must be replaced. Often an
automotive machine shop will handle the
inspection of parts and offer advice
concerning reconditioning and renewal. Note:
Always wait until the engine has been
completely disassembled and all components,
especially the engine block, have been
inspected before deciding what service and
repair operations must be performed by an
automotive machine shop. Since the block’s
condition will be the major factor to consider
when determining whether to overhaul the
original engine or buy a rebuilt one, never
purchase parts or have machine work done on
other components until the block has been
thoroughly inspected. As a general rule, time
is the primary cost of an overhaul, so it doesn’t
pay to refit worn or substandard parts.
As a final note, to ensure maximum life and
minimum trouble from a rebuilt engine,
everything must be assembled with care, in a
spotlessly-clean environment.
3 Compression check 2
1 A compression check will tell you what
mechanical condition the upper end (pistons,
rings, valves, head gaskets) of your engine is
in. Specifically, it can tell you if the
compression is down due to leakage caused
by worn piston rings, defective valves and
seats, or a blown head gasket. Note: The
engine must be at normal operating
temperature, and the battery must be fully-
charged, for this check. 
2 Begin by cleaning the area around the
spark plugs before you remove them
(compressed air should be used, if available,


otherwise a small brush or even a bicycle tyre
pump will work). The idea is to prevent dirt
from getting into the cylinders as the
compression check is being done.
3 Remove all the spark plugs from the engine
4 Block the throttle wide open, or have an
assistant hold the throttle pedal down.
5 On carburettor models, disconnect the LT
lead from the coil. On fuel injection models,
disable the fuel pump and ignition circuit by
removing the main relay (see illustration).
This is to avoid the possibility of a fire from
fuel being sprayed in the engine
compartment. The location of the main relay is
generally near the fuse panel area under the
bonnet, but refer to Chapter 12 for the
specific location on your model.
6 Fit the compression gauge in the No 1
spark plug hole (No 1 cylinder is nearest the
radiator).
7 Turn the engine on the starter motor over at
least seven compression strokes, and watch
the gauge. The compression should build up
quickly in a healthy engine. Low compression
on the first stroke, followed by gradually-
increasing pressure on successive strokes,
indicates worn piston rings. A low
compression reading on the first stroke, which
doesn’t build up during successive strokes,
indicates leaking valves or a blown head
gasket (a cracked head could also be the
cause). Deposits on the undersides of the
valve heads can also cause low compression.
Record the highest gauge reading obtained.
8 Repeat the procedure for the remaining
cylinders, and compare the results to the
compression listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations.
9 If compression was low, add some engine
oil (about three squirts from a plunger-type oil
can) to each cylinder, through the spark plug
hole, and repeat the test.
10 If the compression increases after the oil
is added, the piston rings are definitely worn.
If the compression doesn’t increase
significantly, the leakage is occurring at the
valves or head gasket. Leakage past the
valves may be caused by burned valve seats
and/or faces or warped, cracked or bent
valves.
11 If two adjacent cylinders have equally low
compression, there’s a strong possibility that
the head gasket between them is blown. The
appearance of coolant in the combustion
chambers or the crankcase would verify this
condition.
12 If one cylinder is 20 percent lower than the
others, and the engine has a slightly rough
idle, a worn exhaust lobe on the camshaft
could be the cause.
13 If the compression is unusually high, the
combustion chambers are probably coated
with carbon deposits. If that’s the case, the
cylinder head should be removed and
decarbonised.
14 If compression is way down, or varies
greatly between cylinders, it would be a good
idea to have a leak-down test performed by a
garage. This test will pinpoint exactly 
where the leakage is occurring and how
severe it is.
4 Engine removal - 
methods and precautions
If you’ve decided that an engine must be
removed for overhaul or major repair work,
several preliminary steps should be taken.
Locating a suitable place to work is
extremely important. Adequate work space,
along with storage space for the vehicle, will
be needed. If a workshop or garage isn’t
available, at the very least a flat, level, clean
work surface made of concrete or asphalt is
required.
Cleaning the engine compartment and
engine before beginning the removal
procedure will help keep tools clean and
organised.
An engine hoist or A-frame will also be
necessary. Make sure the equipment is rated
in excess of the combined weight of the
engine and accessories. Safety is of primary
importance, considering the potential hazards
involved in lifting the engine out of the vehicle.
If the engine is being removed by a novice,
a helper should be available. Advice and aid
from someone more experienced would also
be helpful. There are many instances when
one person cannot simultaneously perform all
of the operations required when lifting the
engine out of the vehicle.
Plan the operation ahead of time. Arrange
for or obtain all the tools and equipment you’ll
need prior to beginning the job. Some of the
equipment necessary to perform engine
removal and refitting safely and with relative
ease are (in addition to an engine hoist) a
heavy-duty trolley jack, complete sets of
spanners and sockets as described in the
front of this manual, wooden blocks, and
plenty of rags and cleaning solvent for
mopping up spilled oil, coolant and fuel. If the
hoist must be hired, make sure that you
arrange for it in advance, and perform all of
the operations possible without it beforehand.
This will save you money and time.
Plan for the vehicle to be out of use for
quite a while. A machine shop will be required
to perform some of the work which the do-it-
yourselfer can’t accomplish without special
equipment. These establishments often have
a busy schedule, so it would be a good idea
to consult them before removing the engine,
in order to accurately estimate the amount of
time required to rebuild or repair components
that may need work.
Always be extremely careful when removing
and refitting the engine. Serious injury can
result from careless actions. Plan ahead, take
your time and a job of this nature, although
major, can be accomplished successfully.
Warning: The air conditioning
system is under high pressure.
Do not loosen any fittings or
remove any components until
after the system has been discharged by a
qualified engineer. Always wear eye
protection when disconnecting air
conditioning system fittings.
Caution: If removing the M40
engine, it is important not to turn
the engine upside-down for
longer than 10 minutes since it is
possible for the oil to drain out of the
hydraulic tappets. This would render the
tappets unserviceable, and damage could
possibly occur to the engine when it is
next started up.
5 Engine - removal and refitting 3
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code before
disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Relieve the fuel system pressure (see
Chapter 4), then disconnect the negative
cable from the battery. 
2 Cover the wings and front panel, and
remove the bonnet (see Chapter 11). Special
pads are available to protect the wings, but an
old bedspread or blanket will also work.
3 Remove the air cleaner housing and intake
ducts (see Chapter 4).
4 Drain the cooling system (see Chapter 1).
5 Label the vacuum lines, emissions system
hoses, wiring connectors, earth straps and
fuel lines, to ensure correct refitting, then
General engine overhaul procedures  2B•5
3.5  As a safety precaution, before
performing a compression check, remove
the cover and the main relay (arrowed)
from the left side of the engine
compartment to disable the fuel and
ignition systems (525i model shown, other
models similar)


detach them. Pieces of masking tape with
numbers or letters written on them work well
6 Label and detach all coolant hoses from the
engine (see Chapter 3).
7 Remove the cooling fan, shroud and
radiator (see Chapter 3). Note: On the M40
engine, it is only necessary to remove the
cooling fan and shroud; however, prevent
damage to the radiator by covering it with a
piece of wood or cardboard.
8 Remove the drivebelts (see Chapter 1).
9 Disconnect the fuel lines from the fuel rail
(see Chapter 4). 
Warning: Fuel is extremely
flammable, so take extra
precautions when you work on
any part of the fuel system. Don’t
smoke, or allow open flames or bare light
bulbs, near the work area, and don’t work
in a garage where a natural gas-type
appliance (such as a water heater or
clothes dryer) with a pilot light is present.
If you spill any fuel on your skin, rinse it off
immediately with soap and water. When
you perform any kind of work on the fuel
system, wear safety glasses, and have a
fire extinguisher on hand.
10 Disconnect the accelerator cable (see
Chapter 4) and kickdown linkage/speed
control cable (see Chapter 7B), if applicable,
from the engine.
11 Where fitted, unbolt the power steering
pump (see Chapter 10). Leave the lines/hoses
attached, and make sure the pump is kept in
an upright position in the engine compartment
(use wire or rope to restrain it out of the way).
12 On air-conditioned models, unbolt the
compressor (see Chapter 3) and set it aside,
or tie it up out of the way. Do not disconnect
the hoses.
13 Drain the engine oil (see Chapter 1) and
remove the filter. Remove the engine splash
guard from under the engine.
14 Remove the starter motor (see Chapter 5).
15 Remove the alternator (see Chapter 5).
This is not essential on all models, but it is a
good idea in any case to avoid accidental
damage.
16 Unbolt the exhaust system from the
engine (see Chapter 4).
17 If you’re working on a vehicle with an
automatic transmission, remove the torque
converter-to-driveplate fasteners (see
Chapter 7B). On the M40 engine, unbolt the
automatic transmission fluid coolant pipes
from the sump.
18 Support the transmission with a jack.
Position a block of wood between them, to
prevent damage to the transmission. Special
transmission jacks with safety chains are
available - use one if possible.
19 Attach an engine sling or a length of chain
to the lifting brackets on the engine. If the
brackets have been removed, the chain can
be bolted directly to the intake manifold studs,
but place a flat washer between the chain and
the nut, and tighten the nut all the way up to
the chain, to avoid the possibility of the studs
bending.
20 Roll the hoist into position and connect
the sling to it. Take up the slack in the sling or
chain, but don’t lift the engine. 
Warning: DO NOT place any part
of your body under the engine
when it’s supported only by a
hoist or other lifting device.
21 On M10, M20 and M30 engines, remove
the transmission rear crossmember, and
slightly lower the rear of the transmission.
22 Remove the transmission-to-engine block
bolts using a Torx socket. Note: The bolts
holding the bellhousing to the engine block
will require a swivel at the socket, and a very
long extension going back towards the
transmission.
23 Remove the engine mounting-to-frame
bracket nuts. On the M40 engine, unbolt the
dampers from the mountings.
24 Recheck to be sure nothing is still
connecting the engine to the transmission or
vehicle. Disconnect anything still remaining.
25 Raise the engine slightly. Carefully work it
forwards to separate it from the transmission.
If you’re working on a vehicle with an
automatic transmission, you may find the
torque converter comes forward with the
engine. If it stays with the transmission, leave
it, but you may find it easier to let it come
forward until it can be grasped easier and be
pulled from the crankshaft. Note: When
refitting the torque converter to the
transmission before the engine is refitted, be
sure to renew the transmission front pump
seal, which will probably be damaged when
the converter comes out with the engine.
Either method is acceptable, but be prepared
for some fluid to leak from the torque
converter if it comes out of the transmission. If
you’re working on a vehicle with a manual
transmission, draw the engine forwards until
the input shaft is completely disengaged from
the clutch. Slowly raise the engine out of the
engine compartment. Check carefully to make
sure everything is disconnected.
26 Remove the flywheel/driveplate (and
where applicable, the engine rear plate), and
mount the engine on an engine stand (see
illustration). Do not turn the M40 engine
upside-down (see Caution in Section 4).
Refitting
27 Check the engine and transmission
mountings. If they’re worn or damaged, renew
them.
28 Refit the flywheel or driveplate (see
Chapter 2A). If you’re working on a manual
transmission vehicle, refit the clutch and
pressure plate (see Chapter 7A). Now is a
good time to fit a new clutch.
29 If the torque converter came out with the
engine during removal, carefully refit the
converter into the transmission before the
engine is lowered into the vehicle.
30 Carefully lower the engine into the engine
compartment - make sure the engine
mountings line up.
31 If you’re working on an automatic
transmission vehicle, guide the torque
converter onto the crankshaft following the
procedure outlined in Chapter 7B.
32 If you’re working on a manual
transmission vehicle, apply a dab of high-
melting-point grease to the input shaft, and
guide it into the clutch and crankshaft pilot
bearing until the bellhousing is flush with the
engine block.. Do not allow the weight of the
engine to hang on the input shaft.
33 Refit the transmission-to-engine bolts,
and tighten them securely. 
Caution: DO NOT use the bolts to
force the transmission and
engine together.
34 Refit the remaining components in the
reverse order of removal.
35 Add coolant, oil, power steering and
transmission fluid as needed.

6 Engine overhaul - alternatives
The do-it-yourselfer is faced with a number
of options when performing an engine
overhaul. The decision to renew the engine
block, piston/connecting rod assemblies and
crankshaft depends on a number of factors,
with the number one consideration being the
condition of the block. Other considerations
are cost, access to machine shop facilities,
parts availability, time required to complete
the project, and the extent of prior mechanical
experience on the part of the do-it-yourselfer.
Some of the alternatives include:
Individual parts - If the inspection
procedures reveal that the engine block and
most engine components are in re-usable
condition, purchasing individual parts may be
the most economical alternative. The block,
crankshaft and piston/connecting rod
assemblies should all be inspected carefully.
Even if the block shows little wear, the
cylinder bores should be surface-honed.
Crankshaft kit - A crankshaft kit (where
available) consists of a reground crankshaft
with matched undersize new main and
connecting big-end bearings. Sometimes,
reconditioned connecting rods and new
pistons and rings are included with the kit
(such a kit is sometimes called an “engine
kit”). If the block is in good condition, but the
crankshaft journals are scored or worn, a
crankshaft kit and other individual parts may
be the most economical alternative.
Short block - A short block consists of an
engine block with a crankshaft and
piston/connecting rod assemblies already
fitted. New bearings are fitted, and all
clearances will be correct. The existing
camshaft, valve train components, cylinder
head and external parts can be bolted to the
short block with little or no machine shop
work necessary.
Full block - A “full” or “complete” block
consists of a short block plus an oil pump,
sump, cylinder head, valve cover, camshaft
and valve train components, timing sprockets
and chain (or belt) and timing cover. All
components are fitted with new bearings,
seals and gaskets used throughout. The
refitting of manifolds and external parts is all
that’s necessary.
Give careful thought to which alternative is
best for you, and discuss the situation with
local machine shops, parts dealers and
experienced rebuilders before ordering or
purchasing new parts.
7 Engine overhaul - 
dismantling sequence
1 It’s much easier to dismantle and work on
the engine if it’s mounted on a portable
engine stand. A stand can often be hired quite
cheaply from a tool hire shop. Before the
engine is mounted on a stand, the
flywheel/driveplate should be removed from
the engine.
2 If a stand isn’t available, it’s possible to
dismantle the engine with it blocked up on the
floor. Be extra-careful not to tip or drop the
engine when working without a stand.
3 If you’re going to obtain a rebuilt engine, all
the external components listed below must
come off first, to be transferred to the new
engine if applicable. This is also the case if
you’re doing a complete engine overhaul
yourself. Note: When removing the external
components from the engine, pay close
attention to details that may be helpful or
important during refitting. Note the fitted
position of gaskets, seals, spacers, pins,
brackets, washers, bolts and other small items.
Alternator and brackets
Emissions control components
Distributor, HT leads and spark plugs
Thermostat and housing cover
Water pump
Fuel injection/carburettor and fuel system
components
Intake and exhaust manifolds
Oil filter and oil pressure sending unit
Engine mounting brackets (see illustration)
Clutch and flywheel/driveplate
Engine rear plate (where applicable)
4 If you’re obtaining a short block, which
consists of the engine block, crankshaft,
pistons and connecting rods all assembled,
then the cylinder head, sump and oil pump
will have to be removed as well. See Section 6
for additional information regarding the
different possibilities to be considered.
5 If you’re planning a complete overhaul, the
engine must be dismantled and the internal
components removed in the following general
order:
Valve cover
Intake and exhaust manifolds
Timing belt or chain covers
Timing chain/belt
Water pump
Cylinder head
Sump
Oil pump
Piston/connecting rod assemblies
Crankshaft and main bearings
Camshaft
Rocker shafts and rocker arms (M10, M20
and M30 engines)

6 Before beginning the dismantling and
overhaul procedures, make sure the following
items are available. Also, refer to Section 21
for a list of tools and materials needed for
engine reassembly.
Common hand tools
Small cardboard boxes or plastic bags for
storing parts
Compartment-type metal box for storing
the hydraulic tappets (M40 engine)

1 Remove the cylinder head (see Chapter 2A).
2 Remove the oil supply tube from its
mounting on top of the cylinder head (see
illustrations). Note: It’s important to renew
the seals under the tube mounting bolts.
7.3  Engine left-hand mounting bracket -
8.2a  Remove the oil tube from the top of

note the location of all gaskets and
washers for reassembly


M10, M20 and M30 engines
3 Adjust all valves to their maximum clearance
by rotating the eccentric on the valve end of
the rocker arm towards the centre of the head
(see Chapter 1, if necessary).
4 Before removing the thrustplate, measure
the camshaft endfloat by mounting a dial
indicator to the front end of the cylinder head,
with the probe resting on the camshaft (see
illustration). Prise the camshaft back-and-
forth in the cylinder head. The reading is the
camshaft endfloat. Compare the reading to
this Chapter’s Specifications.
5 Unbolt and remove the camshaft
thrustplate. Note: There are two different
locations for the thrustplate. On M10 and M30
engines, it is attached on the front of the
cylinder head, behind the timing gear flange.
On M20 and M40 engines, the thrustplate is
located inside the head, by the rocker shafts,
at the forward end of the cylinder head.
6 Remove the rear cover plate from the back
of the cylinder head (see illustration).
7 Remove the retaining clips from each of the
rocker arms. Note: There is more than one
style of clip. The wire-type clips (see
illustration) are fitted one each side of the
rocker arm; the spring-steel-type goes over
the rocker arm, and clips onto either side of it.
8 Before removing the rocker arm shafts,
measure the rocker arm radial clearance,
using a dial indicator, and compare your
measurement to the Specifications at the
beginning of this Chapter. Without sliding the
rocker arm along the shaft, try to rotate the
rocker arm against the shaft in each direction
(see illustration). The total movement
measured at the camshaft end of the rocker
arm is the radial clearance. If the clearance is
excessive, either the rocker arm bush, rocker
arm shaft, or both, will need to be renewed.
9 Remove the rubber retaining plugs, or the
threaded plugs, at the front of the cylinder
head, as applicable. There is a plug in front of
each rocker shaft. 
Caution: If your engine has
welded-in retaining plugs at the
front of the rocker shafts, take
the cylinder head to a machine
shop for plug removal, to avoid possible
damage to the cylinder head or the rocker
arm shafts.
10 Rotate the camshaft until the most rocker
arms possible are loose (not compressing
their associated valve springs).
11 For the remaining rocker arms that are still
compressing their valve springs, BMW
recommends using a special forked tool to
compress the rocker arms against the valve
springs (and therefore take the valve spring
tension off the camshaft lobe). If the tool is not
available, insert a standard screwdriver into the
gap above the adjuster eccentric at the valve-
end tip of each rocker arm. Using the
screwdrivers, prise the rocker arms against the
valve springs, and hold them in place as the
camshaft is removed (see the next paragraph).
At least one assistant will be necessary for this
operation, since three or four valve springs
usually need compressing. If no assistance is
available, you could try retaining the
screwdrivers that are compressing the valve
springs to the bench with lengths of sturdy wire. 
Warning: Be sure the wire is
securely attached to the bench
and screwdrivers, or the
screwdrivers could fly off the cylinder
head, possibly causing injury.
12 When all the rocker arms are no longer
contacting the camshaft lobes, slowly and
carefully pull the camshaft out the front of the
cylinder head. It may be necessary to rotate
the camshaft as it is removed. 
Caution: Be very careful not to
scratch the camshaft bearing
journals in the cylinder head as
the camshaft is withdrawn.
13 After removing the camshaft, carefully
remove the rocker arm shafts. On models
without threaded holes at the front of the
shafts, drive them out from the rear of the
cylinder head with a hammer and hardwood
dowel that is slightly smaller in diameter than
the rocker arm shaft (see illustration). For

14 As each rocker arm shaft is slid out of the
cylinder head, the rocker arms will be
released, one by one.
15 Drop each rocker arm into a labelled bag,
so they can be returned to their original
locations on reassembly. While you’re
removing the rocker arm shafts, note their
orientation. The guide plate notches and the
small oil holes face in; the large oil holes face
down, toward the valve guides. Also, label the
rocker shafts so they can be returned to their
original locations in the cylinder head.
M40 engines
Caution: Keep the cylinder head
upright until all of the hydraulic
tappets have been removed. If
this precaution is not taken, the
oil may drain out of the tappets and render
them unserviceable.
16 Check that the camshaft bearing caps are
numbered or identified for location.
17 Progressively unscrew and remove the
camshaft bearing cap retaining bolts, then
remove the caps (see illustrations).
18 Lift the camshaft from the top of the
cylinder head, and remove the oil seal from
the timing end.
19 Have ready a compartmentalised box
filled with engine oil to receive the hydraulic
tappets so that they are kept identified for
their correct location (see illustration). Also
have a further box ready to receive the cam
followers.
20 Remove the cam followers and thrust
discs, then lift out the hydraulic tappets from
their bores in the cylinder head (see
illustrations).
All engines
21 Before the valves are removed, arrange to
label and store them, along with their related
components, so they can be kept separate
and reinstalled in the same valve guides from
which they’re removed (see illustration).
22 Compress the springs on the first valve
with a spring compressor, and remove the
collets (see illustration). Carefully release the
valve spring compressor, and remove the
retainer, the spring and the spring seat (if
used). 
23 Pull the valve out of the head, then
remove the oil seal from the guide.

24 Repeat the procedure for the remaining
valves. Remember to keep all the parts for
each valve together, so they can be refitted in
the same locations.
25 Once the valves and related components
have been removed and stored in an
organised manner, the head should be
thoroughly cleaned and inspected. If a
complete engine overhaul is being done,
finish the engine dismantling procedures
before beginning the cylinder head cleaning
and inspection process.
9 Cylinder head and
components - 
cleaning and inspection
4
1 Thorough cleaning of the cylinder head(s)
and related valve train components, followed
by a detailed inspection, will enable you to
decide how much valve service work must be
done during the engine overhaul. Note: If the
engine was severely overheated, the cylinder
head is probably warped (see paragraph 10).
Cleaning
2 Scrape all traces of old gasket material and
sealing compound off the cylinder head,
intake manifold and exhaust manifold sealing
surfaces. Be very careful not to gouge the
cylinder head. Special gasket removal
solvents are available at motor factors.
3 Remove all built-up scale from the coolant
passages.
4 Run a stiff brush through the various holes
to remove deposits that may have formed in
them.
5 Run an appropriate-size tap into each of the
threaded holes, to remove corrosion and
thread sealant that may be present. If
compressed air is available, use it to clear the
holes of debris produced by this operation. 
Warning: Wear eye protection
when using compressed air!
6 Clean the cylinder head with solvent, and
dry it thoroughly. Compressed air will speed
the drying process, and ensure that all holes
and recessed areas are clean. Note:
Decarbonising chemicals are available, and
may prove very useful when cleaning cylinder
heads and valve train components. They are
very caustic, however, and should be used
with caution. Be sure to follow the instructions
on the container.
7 Clean all the rocker shafts/arms/followers,
springs, valve springs, spring seats, keepers
and retainers with solvent, and dry them
thoroughly. Clean the components from one
valve at a time, to avoid mixing up the parts. 
Caution: DO NOT clean the
hydraulic tappets of the M40
engine; leave them completely
immersed in oil.
8 Scrape off any heavy deposits that may
have formed on the valves, then use a
motorised wire brush to remove deposits from
the valve heads and stems. Again, make sure
the valves don’t get mixed up.
Inspection
Note: Be sure to perform all of the following
inspection procedures before concluding that
machine shop work is required. Make a list of
the items that need attention.
Cylinder head
9 Inspect the head very carefully for cracks,
evidence of coolant leakage, and other
damage. If cracks are found, check with an
machine shop concerning repair. If repair isn’t
possible, a new cylinder head should be
obtained.
10 Using a straightedge and feeler gauge,
check the head gasket mating surface for
warpage (see illustration). If the warpage
exceeds the limit listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications, it may be possible to have it
resurfaced at a machine shop, providing the
head is not reduced to less than the specified
minimum thickness.
11 Examine the valve seats in each of the
combustion chambers. If they’re badly pitted,
cracked or burned, the head will require
servicing that’s beyond the scope of the home
mechanic.
12 Check the valve stem-to-guide clearance
by measuring the lateral movement of the
valve stem with a dial indicator (see
illustration). The valve must be in the guide
and approximately 2.0 mm off the seat. The
total valve stem movement indicated by the
gauge needle must be divided by two, to
obtain the actual clearance. After this is done,
if there’s still some doubt regarding the
condition of the valve guides, they should be
checked by a machine shop (the cost should
be minimal).
Valves
13 Carefully inspect each valve face for
uneven wear, deformation, cracks, pits and
burned areas (see illustration). Check the
valve stem for scuffing and the neck for
cracks. Rotate the valve, and check for any
obvious indication that it’s bent. Look for pits
and excessive wear on the end of the stem.
The presence of any of these conditions
indicates the need for valve service as
described in the next Section.
14 Measure the margin width on each valve
(see illustration). Any valve with a margin
narrower than specified will have to be
replaced with a new one.
Valve components
15 Check each valve spring for wear on the
ends. The tension of all springs should be
checked with a special fixture before deciding
2B•10 General engine overhaul procedures
9.14  The margin width on each valve must
be as specified (if no margin exists, the
valve cannot be reused)
9.13  Check for valve wear at the points
shown here
9.12  A dial indicator can be used to
determine the valve stem-to-guide
clearance (move the valve as indicated by
the arrows)
9.10  Check the cylinder head gasket
surface for warpage by trying to slip a
feeler gauge under the straightedge (see
this Chapter’s Specifications for the
maximum warpage allowed, and use a
feeler gauge of that thickness)

(take the springs to a machine shop for this
16 Stand each spring on a flat surface, and
check it for squareness (see illustration). If
any of the springs are distorted or sagged, or
possibly have a broken coil, fit new parts.
17 Check the spring retainers and keepers
for obvious wear and cracks. Any
questionable parts should be renewed, as
extensive damage will occur if they fail during
engine operation.
Rocker arms (M10, M20 and 
M30 engines)
Note: The rocker arms for the exhaust valves
are the most subject to wear, and should be
checked with particular care.
18 Inspect all the rocker arms for excessive
wear on the tips that contact the valve stem
and camshaft (see illustration). 
19 Check the rocker arm radial clearance
(see Section 8). If it’s excessive, either the
rocker arm bush or the shaft (or both) is
excessively worn. To determine which is more
worn, slide the rocker arm onto an unworn
portion of the rocker arm shaft, and check the
radial clearance again. If it’s now within speci-
fications, the shaft is probably the most-worn
component. If it’s not within specifications,
the rocker arm bushes should be renewed.
Rocker arm shafts (M10, M20 and
M30 engines)
20 Check the shafts for scoring, excessive
wear and other damage. The areas where the
rocker arms contact the shafts should be
smooth. If there is a visible ridge at the edge
of where the rocker arm rides, the shaft is
probably worn excessively.
Cam followers and hydraulic tappets
(M40 engines)
21 Check the cam followers where they
contact the valve stems and pivot posts for
wear, scoring and pitting. If there is excessive
wear on both the followers and camshaft,
then a new camshaft, complete with cam
followers, must be obtained.
22 Similarly check the hydraulic tappets where
they contact the bores in the cylinder head for
wear, scoring and pitting. Occasionally, a
hydraulic tappet may be noisy and require
renewal, and this will have been noticed when
the engine was running. It is not easy to check a
tappet for internal damage or wear once it has
been removed; if there is any doubt, a complete
set of new tappets should be fitted.
Camshaft
23 Inspect the camshaft journals (the round
bearing areas) and lobes for scoring, pitting,
flaking and excessive wear. Using a
micrometer, measure the height of each
exhaust and intake lobe. Compare the heights
of all the exhaust lobes and intake lobes. If the
readings among the exhaust valve lobes or
intake valve lobes vary more than about 
0.08 mm, or if the camshaft is exhibiting any
signs of wear, renew the camshaft.
24 Inspect the camshaft bearing surfaces in
the cylinder head for scoring and other
damage. If the bearing surfaces are scored or
damaged, you’ll normally have to renew the
cylinder head, since the bearings are simply a
machined surface in the cylinder head. Note:
A machine shop (particularly one that
specialises in BMWs) or dealer service
department may be able to provide an
alternative to fitting a new cylinder head, if the
only problem with the head is mildly-scored
camshaft bearing surfaces.
25 Using a micrometer, measure the journals
on the camshaft, and record the
measurements (see illustration). Using a
telescoping gauge or inside micrometer,
measure the camshaft bearing diameters in the
cylinder head (on the M40 engine, refit the
bearing caps first). Subtract the camshaft
journal measurement from its corresponding
bearing inside diameter to obtain the oil
clearance. Compare the oil clearance to what’s
listed in this Chapter’s Specifications. If it’s not
within tolerance, a new camshaft and/or
cylinder head will be required. Note: Before
fitting a new cylinder head, check with a
machine shop (particularly one that specialises
in BMWs). They may be able to repair the head.
10 Valves - servicing 4
1 Examine the valves as described in Sec-
tion 9, paragraphs 13 and 14. Renew any
valve that shows signs of wear or damage.
2 If the valve appears satisfactory at this
stage, measure the valve stem diameter at
several points using a micrometer (see
illustration 9.13). Any significant difference in
the readings obtained indicates wear of the
valve stem. Should any of these conditions be
apparent, the valve(s) must be renewed.
3 If the valves are in satisfactory condition they
should be ground (lapped) into their respective
seats to ensure a gas-tight seal. If the seat is
only lightly pitted, or if it has been re-cut, fine
grinding compound should be used to produce
the required finish. Coarse valve-grinding
compound should not normally be used,
unless a seat is badly burned or deeply pitted.
If this is the case, the cylinder head and valves
should be inspected by an expert, to decide
whether seat re-cutting or even the renewal of
the valve or seat insert is required.
4 Valve grinding is carried out as follows.
Place the cylinder head upside-down on a
bench, with a block of wood at each end to
give clearance for the valve stems.
5 Smear a trace of the appropriate grade of
valve-grinding compound on the seat face,
and press a suction grinding tool onto the
valve head. With a semi-rotary action, grind
the valve head to its seat, lifting the valve
occasionally to redistribute the grinding
compound (see illustration).

9.16  Check each valve spring for

6 If coarse grinding compound is being used,
work only until a dull, matt even surface is
produced on both the valve seat and the
valve, then wipe off the used compound and
repeat the process with fine compound. When
a smooth, unbroken ring of light grey matt
finish is produced on both the valve and seat,
the grinding operation is complete. Do not
grind in the valves any further than absolutely
necessary.
7 When all the valves have been ground-in,
carefully wash off all traces of grinding
compound using paraffin or a suitable solvent
before reassembly of the cylinder head.
11 Cylinder head - reassembly 5
1 Make sure the cylinder head is spotlessly-
clean before beginning reassembly.
2 If the head was sent out for valve servicing,
the valves and related components will
already be in place. Begin the reassembly
procedure with paragraph 8.
3 Starting at one end of the head, apply
molybdenum disulphide (“moly”) grease or
clean engine oil to each valve stem, and refit
the first valve.
4 Lubricate the lip of the valve guide seal,
carefully slide it over the tip of the valve, then
slide it all the way down the stem to the guide.
Using a hammer and a deep socket or seal-
fitting tool, gently tap the seal into place until
it’s completely seated on the guide (see
illustrations). Don’t twist or distort a seal
during fitting, or it won’t seal properly against
the valve stem. Note: On some engines, the
seals for intake and exhaust valves are
different - don’t mix them up.
5 Drop the spring seat or shim(s) over the
valve guide, and set the valve spring and
retainer in place.
6 Compress the spring with a valve spring
compressor and carefully refit the collets in
the upper groove, then slowly release the
compressor and make sure the collets seat
properly (see illustration).
7 Repeat paragraphs 3 to 6 for each of the
valves. Be sure to return the components to
their original locations - don’t mix them up!
M10, M20 and M30 engines
8 Refit the rocker arms and shafts by
reversing the dismantling sequence. Be sure
to refit the rocker shafts in the correct
orientation. The guide plate notches and the
small oil holes face inwards; the large oil holes
face down, toward the valve guides. 
9 Lubricate the camshaft journals and lobes
(see illustration), then carefully insert it into
the cylinder head, rotating it as you go so the
camshaft lobes will clear the rocker arms. It
will also be necessary to compress the rocker
arms against the valve springs, as described
in Section 8, so they’ll clear the camshaft
lobes. Be very careful not to scratch or gouge
the camshaft bearing surfaces in the cylinder
head.
M40 engines
10 Lubricate the bores for the hydraulic
tappets in the cylinder head, then insert the
tappets in their original positions.
11 Locate the thrust discs and cam followers
on the valves and pivot posts in their original
positions.
12 Lubricate the bearing surfaces of the
camshaft in the cylinder head.
13 Locate the camshaft in the cylinder head
so that the valves of No 1 cylinder are both
open, and the valves of No 4 cylinder are
“rocking” (exhaust closing and inlet opening).
No 1 cylinder is at the timing belt end. 
14 Lubricate the bearing surfaces in the
bearing caps, then locate them in their correct
positions and insert the retaining bolts.
Progressively tighten the bolts to the specified
torque.
15 Fit a new oil seal to the camshaft front
bearing cap (see Chapter 2A, Section 11).
All engines
16 Refit the oil supply tube to the top of the
cylinder head together with new seals, then
tighten the bolts to the specified torque.
17 The cylinder head may now be refitted
(see Chapter 2A).
12 Pistons/connecting rods -

Note: Before removing the piston/connecting
rod assemblies, remove the cylinder head and
the sump. On M10, M20 and M30 engines
only, remove the oil pump. Refer to the
appropriate Sections in Chapter 2A.

manufacturer’s instructions provided with the
tool. Failure to remove the ridges before
attempting to remove the piston/connecting
rod assemblies may result in piston ring
breakage.
2 After the cylinder ridges have been
removed, turn the engine upside-down so the
crankshaft is facing up.
3 Before the connecting rods are removed,
check the side play with feeler gauges. Slide
them between the first connecting rod and
crankshaft web until no play is apparent (see
illustration). The side play is equal to the
thickness of the feeler gauge(s). If the side
play exceeds the service limit, new
connecting rods will be required. If new rods
(or a new crankshaft) are fitted, ensure that
some side play is retained (if not, the rods will
have to be machined to restore it - consult a
machine shop for advice if necessary). Repeat
the procedure for the remaining connecting
rods.
4 Check the connecting rods and caps for
identification marks. If they aren’t plainly
marked, use a small centre-punch to make
the appropriate number of indentations (see
illustration) on each rod and cap (1, 2, 3, etc.,
depending on the cylinder they’re associated
with).
5 Loosen each of the connecting rod cap
nuts/bolts a half-turn at a time until they can
be removed by hand. Remove the No 1
connecting rod cap and bearing shell. Don’t
drop the bearing shell out of the cap.
6 Where applicable, slip a short length of
plastic or rubber hose over each connecting
rod cap stud to protect the crankshaft journal
and cylinder wall as the piston is removed
(see illustration).
7 Remove the bearing shell, and push the
connecting rod/piston assembly out through
the top of the engine. Use a wooden hammer
handle to push on the upper bearing surface
in the connecting rod. If resistance is felt,
double-check to make sure that all of the
ridge was removed from the cylinder.
8 Repeat the procedure for the remaining
cylinders.
9 After removal, reassemble the connecting
rod caps and bearing shells in their respective
connecting rods, and refit the cap nuts/bolts
finger-tight. Leaving the old bearing shells in
place until reassembly will help prevent the
connecting big-end bearing surfaces from
being accidentally nicked or gouged.
10 Don’t separate the pistons from the
connecting rods (see Section 18).
13 Crankshaft - removal 5
Note: The crankshaft can be removed only
after the engine has been removed from the
vehicle. It’s assumed that the flywheel or
driveplate, vibration damper, timing chain or
belt, sump, oil pump and piston/connecting
rod assemblies have already been removed.
The rear main oil seal housing must be
unbolted and separated from the block before
proceeding with crankshaft removal.
1 Before the crankshaft is removed, check
the endfloat. Mount a dial indicator with the
stem in line with the crankshaft and touching
the nose of the crankshaft, or one of its webs
(see illustration).
2 Push the crankshaft all the way to the rear,
and zero the dial indicator. Next, prise the
crankshaft to the front as far as possible, and
check the reading on the dial indicator. The
distance that it moves is the endfloat. If it’s
greater than the maximum endfloat listed in
this Chapter’s Specifications, check the
crankshaft thrust surfaces for wear. If no wear
is evident, new main bearings should correct
the endfloat.
3 If a dial indicator isn’t available, feeler
gauges can be used. Identify the main bearing
with the thrust flanges either side of it - this is
referred to as the “thrust” main bearing (see
Section 24, paragraph 6). Gently prise or push
the crankshaft all the way to the front of the
engine. Slip feeler gauges between the
crankshaft and the front face of the thrust
main bearing to determine the clearance.
4 Check the main bearing caps to see if
they’re marked to indicate their locations.
They should be numbered consecutively from
the front of the engine to the rear. If they
aren’t, mark them with number-stamping dies
or a centre-punch (see illustration). Main
bearing caps generally have a cast-in arrow,
which points to the front of the engine.
Loosen the main bearing cap bolts a quarter-
turn at a time each, working from the outer
ends towards the centre, until they can be
removed by hand. Note if any stud bolts are
used, and make sure they’re returned to their
original locations when the crankshaft is
refitted.
General engine overhaul procedures  2B•13
12.4  Mark the big-end bearing caps in
order from the front of the engine to the
rear (one mark for the front cap, two for
the second one and so on)
12.3  Check the connecting rod side play
with a feeler gauge as shown
12.1  A ridge reamer is required to remove
the ridge from the top of each cylinder - do
this before removing the pistons!
13.1  Checking crankshaft endfloat with a
12.6  To prevent damage to the crankshaft
journals and cylinder walls, slip sections of
rubber or plastic hose over the rod bolts


5 Gently tap the caps with a soft-faced
hammer, then separate them from the engine
block. If necessary, use the bolts as levers to
remove the caps. Try not to drop the bearing
shells if they come out with the caps.
6 Carefully lift the crankshaft out of the
engine. It may be a good idea to have an
assistant available, since the crankshaft is
quite heavy (see illustration). With the
bearing shells in place in the engine block and
main bearing caps, return the caps to their
respective locations on the engine block, and
tighten the bolts finger-tight.
14 Intermediate shaft - 
removal and inspection 5
Note: The intermediate shaft is used on the
M20 engine only. The shaft rotates in the
engine block parallel to the crankshaft. It is
driven by the timing belt, and its only purpose
is to drive the oil pump.
1 Remove the timing belt (see Chapter 2A).
2 With the belt removed, unbolt the gear from
the intermediate shaft and unbolt the front
cover.
3 Remove the oil pump driveshaft (see
Chapter 2A).
4 The shaft is held in the cylinder block by a
retaining plate with two bolts. Remove the
bolts, and pull the shaft forwards and out of
the block.
5 Look for any signs of abnormal wear on the
bearing surfaces or the gear at the back end
of the shaft, which drives the oil pump shaft. If
the bearing surfaces in the engine block show
wear, they’ll have to be attended to by a
machine shop.
15 Engine block - cleaning 2
Caution: The core plugs may be
difficult or impossible to retrieve
if they’re driven into the block
coolant passages.
1 Remove the core plugs from the engine
block. To do this, knock one side of each plug
into the block with a hammer and punch,
grasp the other side by its edge with large
pliers, and pull it out.
2 Using a gasket scraper, remove all traces of
gasket material from the engine block. Be very
careful not to nick or gouge the gasket sealing
surfaces.
3 Remove the main bearing caps, and
separate the bearing shells from the caps and
the engine block. Tag the bearings, indicating
which cylinder they were removed from and
whether they were in the cap or the block,
then set them aside.
4 Remove all of the threaded oil gallery plugs
from the block. The plugs are usually very
tight - they may have to be drilled out and the
holes retapped. Use new plugs when the
engine is reassembled.
5 If the engine is extremely dirty, it should be
taken to a machine shop to be steam-
cleaned.
6 After the block is returned, clean all oil
holes and oil galleries one more time. Brushes
specifically designed for this purpose are
available at most motor factors. Flush the
passages with warm water until the water runs
clear, dry the block thoroughly, and wipe all
machined surfaces with a light, rust-
preventive oil. If you have access to
compressed air, use it to speed the drying
process and to blow out all the oil holes and
galleries. 
Warning: Wear eye protection
when using compressed air!
7 If the block isn’t extremely dirty or sludged
up, you can do an adequate cleaning job with
hot soapy water and a stiff brush. Take plenty
of time, and do a thorough job. Regardless of
the cleaning method used, be sure to clean all
oil holes and galleries very thoroughly, dry the
block completely, and coat all machined
surfaces with light oil.
8 The threaded holes in the block must be
clean to ensure accurate torque readings
during reassembly. Run the proper-size tap
into each of the holes to remove rust,
corrosion, thread sealant or sludge, and to
restore damaged threads (see illustration). If
possible, use compressed air to clear the
holes of debris produced by this operation. Be
sure also that the holes are dry - any oil or
other fluid present could cause the block to
be cracked by hydraulic pressure when the
bolts are tightened. Now is a good time to
clean the threads on all bolts. Note that BMW
recommend that the cylinder head bolts and
main bearing bolts are renewed as a matter of
course.
9 Refit the main bearing caps, and tighten the
bolts finger-tight.
10 After coating the sealing surfaces of the
new core plugs with a suitable sealant, refit
them in the engine block (see illustration).
Make sure they’re driven in straight and
seated properly, or leakage could result.
Special tools are available for this purpose,
but a large socket, with an outside diameter
that will just slip into the core plug, a 1/2-inch
drive extension, and a hammer, will work just
as well.
11 Apply non-hardening sealant to the new
oil gallery plugs, and thread them into the
holes in the block. Make sure they’re
tightened securely.
12 If the engine isn’t going to be
reassembled right away, cover it with a large
plastic bag to keep it clean.
2B•14 General engine overhaul procedures
15.10  A large socket on an extension can
be used to drive the new core plugs into
the block
15.8  All bolt holes in the block -
particularly the main bearing cap and head
bolt holes - should be cleaned and
restored with a tap (be sure to remove
debris from the holes after this is done)
13.6  Remove the crankshaft by lifting
straight up. Be very careful when removing
the crankshaft - it is very heavy
13.4  Use a centre-punch or number-
stamping dies to mark the main bearing
caps to ensure refitting in their original
locations on the block (make the punch
marks near one of the bolt heads)


16 Engine block - inspection 3
1 Before the block is inspected, it should be
cleaned (see Section 15).
2 Visually check the block for cracks, rust
and corrosion. Look for stripped threads in
the threaded holes. It’s also a good idea to
have the block checked for hidden cracks by
a machine shop that has the special
equipment to do this type of work. If defects
are found, have the block repaired, if possible;
otherwise, a new block will be required.
3 Check the cylinder bores for scuffing and
scoring.
4 Measure the diameter of each cylinder at
the top (just under the wear ridge area), centre
and bottom of the cylinder bore, parallel to the
crankshaft axis (see illustrations). 
5 Next, measure each cylinder’s diameter at
the same three locations across the
crankshaft axis. Compare the results to this
Chapter’s Specifications.
6 If the required precision measuring tools
aren’t available, the piston-to-cylinder
clearances can be obtained, though not quite
as accurately, using feeler gauges.
7 To check the clearance, select a feeler
gauge, and slip it into the cylinder along with
the matching piston. The piston must be
positioned exactly as it normally would be.
The feeler gauge must be between the piston
and cylinder on one of the thrust faces (90° to
the gudgeon pin bore).
8 The piston should slip through the cylinder
(with the feeler gauge in place) with moderate
pressure.
9 If it falls through or slides through easily, the
clearance is excessive, and a new piston will
be required. If the piston binds at the lower
end of the cylinder and is loose toward the
top, the cylinder is tapered. If tight spots are
encountered as the piston/feeler gauge is
rotated in the cylinder, the cylinder is out-of-
round.
10 Repeat the procedure for the remaining
pistons and cylinders.
11 If the cylinder walls are badly scuffed or
scored, or if they’re out-of-round or tapered
beyond the limits given in this Chapter’s
Specifications, have the engine block rebored
and honed at a machine shop. If a rebore is
done, oversize pistons and rings will be
required.
12 If the cylinders are in reasonably good
condition and not worn to the outside of the
limits, and if the piston-to-cylinder clearances
can be maintained properly, then they don’t
have to be rebored. Honing (see Section 17)
and a new set of piston rings is all that’s
necessary.
17 Cylinder honing 3
1 Prior to engine reassembly, the cylinder
bores must be honed so the new piston rings
will seat correctly and provide the best
possible combustion chamber seal. Note: If
you don’t have the tools, or don’t want to
tackle the honing operation, most machine
shops will do it for a reasonable fee.
2 Before honing the cylinders, refit the main
bearing caps, and tighten the bolts to the
torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
3 Two types of cylinder hones are commonly
available - the flex hone or “bottle brush”
type, and the more traditional surfacing hone
with spring-loaded stones. Both will do the
job, but for the less-experienced mechanic,
the “bottle brush” hone will probably be easier
to use. You’ll also need some paraffin or
honing oil, rags and an electric drill. Proceed
as follows.
4 Mount the hone in the drill, compress the
stones, and slip it into the first cylinder (see
illustration). Be sure to wear safety goggles
or a face shield!
5 Lubricate the cylinder with plenty of honing
oil, turn on the drill, and move the hone up and
down in the cylinder at a pace that will
produce a fine crosshatch pattern on the
cylinder walls. Ideally, the crosshatch lines
should intersect at approximately a 60° angle
(see illustration). Be sure to use plenty of
lubricant, and don’t take off any more material
than is absolutely necessary to produce the
desired finish. Note: Piston ring manufacturers
may specify a smaller crosshatch angle than
the traditional 60° - read and follow any
instructions included with the new rings.
6 Don’t withdraw the hone from the cylinder
while it’s running. Instead, shut off the drill
and continue moving the hone up and down in
the cylinder until it comes to a complete stop,
then compress the stones and withdraw the
hone. If you’re using a “bottle brush” type
hone, stop the drill, then turn the chuck in the
normal direction of rotation while withdrawing
the hone from the cylinder.
General engine overhaul procedures  2B•15
16.4c  The gauge is then measured with a
micrometer to determine the bore size
16.4b  The ability to “feel” when the
telescoping gauge is at the correct point
will be developed over time, so work
slowly, and repeat the check until you’re
satisfied the bore measurement is accurate
16.4a  Measure the diameter of each
cylinder just under the wear ridge (A), at
the centre (B) and at the bottom (C)
17.5  The cylinder hone should leave a
smooth, crosshatch pattern, with the lines
intersecting at approximately a  60° angle
17.4  A “bottle brush” hone will produce
better results if you’ve never honed
cylinders before


7 Wipe the oil out of the cylinder, and repeat
the procedure for the remaining cylinders.
8 After the honing job is complete, chamfer
the top edges of the cylinder bores with a
small file, so the rings won’t catch when the
pistons are refitted. Be very careful not to nick
the cylinder walls with the end of the file.
9 The entire engine block must be washed
again very thoroughly with warm, soapy
water, to remove all traces of the abrasive grit
produced during the honing operation. Note:
The bores can be considered clean when a
lint-free white cloth - dampened with clean
engine oil - used to wipe them out doesn’t
pick up any more honing residue, which will
show up as grey areas on the cloth. Be sure to
run a brush through all oil holes and galleries,
and flush them with running water.
10 After rinsing, dry the block, and apply a
coat of light rust-preventive oil to all machined
surfaces. Wrap the block in a plastic bag to
keep it clean, and set it aside until
reassembly.
18 Pistons/connecting rods -
inspection 3
1 Before the inspection process can be
carried out, the piston/connecting rod
assemblies must be cleaned and the original
piston rings removed from the pistons. Note:
Always use new piston rings when the engine
is reassembled.
2 Using a piston ring refitting tool, carefully
remove the rings from the pistons. Be careful
not to nick or gouge the pistons in the
process (see illustration).
3 Scrape all traces of carbon from the top of
the piston. A hand-held wire brush or a piece
of fine emery cloth can be used once the
majority of the deposits have been scraped
away. Do not, under any circumstances, use a
wire brush mounted in a drill motor to remove
deposits from the pistons. The piston material
is soft, and may be damaged by the wire
brush.
4 Use a piston ring groove cleaning tool to
remove carbon deposits from the ring
grooves. Be very careful to remove only the
carbon deposits - don’t remove any metal,
and do not nick or scratch the sides of the
ring grooves (see illustration).
5 Once the deposits have been removed,
clean the piston/rod assemblies with solvent,
and dry them with compressed air (if
available). Make sure the oil return holes in the
back sides of the ring grooves are clear.
6 If the pistons and cylinder walls aren’t
damaged or worn excessively, and if the
engine block is not rebored, new pistons
won’t be necessary. Normal piston wear
appears as even vertical wear on the piston
thrust surfaces (90° to the gudgeon pin bore),
and slight looseness of the top ring in its
groove. New piston rings, however, should
always be used when an engine is rebuilt.
7 Carefully inspect each piston for cracks
around the skirt, at the pin bosses, and at the
ring lands.
8 Look for scoring and scuffing on the thrust
faces of the skirt, holes in the piston crown,
and burned areas at the edge of the crown. If
the skirt is scored or scuffed, the engine may
have been suffering from overheating and/or
abnormal combustion, which caused
excessively high operating temperatures. The
cooling and lubrication systems should be
checked thoroughly. A hole in the piston crown
is an indication that abnormal combustion (pre-
ignition) was occurring. Burned areas at the
edge of the piston crown are usually evidence
of spark knock (detonation). If any of the above
problems exist, the causes must be corrected,
or the damage will occur again. The causes
may include intake air leaks, incorrect fuel/air
mixture, or incorrect ignition timing. On later
vehicles with high levels of exhaust emission
control, including catalytic converters, the
problem may be with the EGR (exhaust gas
recirculation) system, where applicable.
9 Corrosion of the piston, in the form of small
pits, indicates that coolant is leaking into the
combustion chamber and/or the crankcase.
Again, the cause must be corrected or the
problem may persist in the rebuilt engine.
10 Measure the piston ring side clearance by
laying a new piston ring in each ring groove
and slipping a feeler gauge in beside it (see
illustration). Check the clearance at three or
four locations around each groove. Be sure to
use the correct ring for each groove - they are
different. If the side clearance is greater than
the figure listed in this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations, new pistons will have to be used.
11 Check the piston-to-bore clearance by
measuring the bore (see Section 16) and the
piston diameter. Make sure the pistons and
bores are correctly matched. Measure the
piston across the skirt, at 90° to, and in line
with, the gudgeon pin (see illustration). (Any
difference between these two measurements
indicates that the piston is no longer perfectly
round.) Subtract the piston diameter from the
bore diameter to obtain the clearance. If it’s
greater than specified, the block will have to
be rebored, and new pistons and rings fitted.
2B•16 General engine overhaul procedures
18.11  Measure the piston diameter at a
90-degree angle to the gudgeon pin, at the
same height as the gudgeon pin
18.10  Check the ring side clearance with a
feeler gauge at several points around the
groove
18.4  The piston ring grooves can be
cleaned with a special tool, as shown 
here
18.2  Removing the compression rings with
a ring expander - note the mark (arrowed)
If a groove cleaning tool isn’t available,
a piece broken off the old ring will do
the job, but protect your hands - piston
rings can be sharp


12 Check the piston-to-rod clearance by
twisting the piston and rod in opposite
directions. Any noticeable play indicates
excessive wear, which must be corrected. The
piston/connecting rod assemblies should be
taken to a machine shop for attention.
13 If the pistons must be removed from the
connecting rods for any reason, they should
be taken to a machine shop. When this is
done, have the connecting rods checked for
bend and twist, since most machine shops
have special equipment for this purpose.
Note: Unless new pistons and/or connecting
rods must be fitted, do not dismantle the
pistons and connecting rods.
14 Check the connecting rods for cracks and
other damage. Temporarily remove the rod
caps, lift out the old bearing shells, wipe the rod
and cap bearing surfaces clean, and inspect
them for nicks, gouges and scratches. After
checking the rods, fit new bearing shells, slip the
caps into place, and tighten the nuts finger-tight.
19 Crankshaft - inspection 3
1 Remove all burrs from the crankshaft oil
holes with a stone, file or scraper (see
illustration).
2 Clean the crankshaft with solvent, and dry it
with compressed air (if available). Be sure to
clean the oil holes with a stiff brush (see
illustration), and flush them with solvent.
3 Check the main and connecting big-end
bearing journals for uneven wear, scoring, pits
and cracks.
4 Rub a copper coin across each journal
several times (see illustration). If a journal
picks up copper from the coin, it’s too rough
and must be reground.
5 Check the rest of the crankshaft for cracks
and other damage. If necessary, have a
machine shop inspect the crankshaft.
6 Using a micrometer, measure the diameter
of the main and connecting rod journals, and
compare the results to this Chapter’s Specifi-
cations (see illustration). By measuring the
diameter at a number of points around each
journal’s circumference, you’ll be able to
determine whether or not the journal is out-of-
round. Take the measurement at each end of
the journal, near the crank webs, to determine
if the journal is tapered.
7 If the crankshaft journals are damaged,
tapered, out-of-round or worn beyond the
limits given in the Specifications, have the
crankshaft reground by a machine shop. Be
sure to use the correct-size bearing shells if
the crankshaft is reconditioned.
8 Check the oil seal journals at each end of
the crankshaft for wear and damage. If the
seal has worn a groove in the journal, or if it’s
nicked or scratched (see illustration), the
new seal may leak when the engine is
reassembled. In some cases, a machine shop
may be able to repair the journal by pressing
on a thin sleeve. If repair isn’t feasible, a new
or different crankshaft should be fitted.
9 Examine the main and big-end bearing
shells (see Section 20).
20 Main and connecting 
big-end bearings - inspection 3
1 Even though the main and connecting big-
end bearings should be renewed during the
engine overhaul, the old bearings should be
retained for close examination, as they may
reveal valuable information about the
condition of the engine (see illustration).
2 Bearing failure occurs because of lack of
lubrication, the presence of dirt or other
foreign particles, overloading the engine, and
corrosion. Regardless of the cause of bearing
failure, it must be corrected before the engine
is reassembled, to prevent it from happening
again.
General engine overhaul procedures  2B•17
19.4  Rubbing a penny lengthways on each
journal will reveal its condition - if copper
rubs off and is embedded in the crankshaft,
the journals should be reground
19.2  Use a wire or stiff plastic bristle
brush to clean the oil passages in the
crankshaft
19.1  The oil holes should be chamfered so
sharp edges don’t gouge or scratch the
new bearings
20.1  Typical bearing failures
A Scratched by dirt: debris embedded into
bearing material
B Lack of oil: overlay wiped out
C Improper seating: bright (polished) sections
D Tapered journal: overlay gone from entire
surface
E Radius ride
F Fatigue failure: craters or pockets
19.8 If the seals have worn grooves in the
crankshaft journals, or if the seal contact
surfaces are nicked or scratched, the new
seals will leak
19.6  Measure the diameter of each
crankshaft journal at several points to
detect taper and out-of-round conditions


3 When examining the bearings, remove
them from the engine block, the main bearing
caps, the connecting rods and the rod caps,
and lay them out on a clean surface in the
same general position as their location in the
engine. This will enable you to match any
bearing problems with the corresponding
crankshaft journal.
4 Dirt and other foreign particles get into the
engine in a variety of ways. It may be left in
the engine during assembly, or it may pass
through filters or the crankcase ventilation
(PCV) system. It may get into the oil, and from
there into the bearings. Metal chips from
machining operations and normal engine wear
are often present. Abrasives are sometimes
left in engine components after recondi-
tioning, especially when parts are not
thoroughly cleaned using the proper cleaning
methods. Whatever the source, these foreign
objects often end up embedded in the soft
bearing material, and are easily recognised.
Large particles will not embed in the bearing,
and will score or gouge the bearing and
journal. The best prevention for this cause of
bearing failure is to clean all parts thoroughly,
and to keep everything spotlessly-clean
during engine assembly. Frequent and regular
engine oil and filter changes are also
recommended.
5 Lack of lubrication (or lubrication
breakdown) has a number of interrelated
causes. Excessive heat (which thins the oil),
overloading (which squeezes the oil from the
bearing face) and oil “leakage” or “throw off”
(from excessive bearing clearances, worn oil
pump, or high engine speeds) all contribute to
lubrication breakdown. Blocked oil passages,
which usually are the result of misaligned oil
holes in a bearing shell, will also oil-starve a
bearing and destroy it. When lack of
lubrication is the cause of bearing failure, the
bearing material is wiped or extruded from the
steel backing of the bearing. Temperatures
may increase to the point where the steel
backing turns blue from overheating.
6 Driving habits can have a definite effect on
bearing life. Full-throttle, low-speed operation
(labouring the engine) puts very high loads on
bearings, which tends to squeeze out the oil
film. These loads cause the bearings to flex,
which produces fine cracks in the bearing
face (fatigue failure). Eventually, the bearing
material will loosen in places, and tear away
from the steel backing. Short-trip driving
leads to corrosion of bearings, because
insufficient engine heat is produced to drive
off the condensation and corrosive gases.
These products collect in the engine oil,
forming acid and sludge. As the oil is carried
to the engine bearings, the acid attacks and
corrodes the bearing material.
7 Incorrect bearing refitting during engine
assembly will lead to bearing failure as well.
Tight-fitting bearings leave insufficient bearing
oil clearance, and will result in oil starvation.
Dirt or foreign particles trapped behind a
bearing shell result in high spots on the
bearing, which will lead to failure.
21 Engine overhaul - 
reassembly sequence
1 Before beginning engine reassembly, make
sure you have all the necessary new parts,
gaskets and seals, as well as the following
items on hand:
Common hand tools
A torque wrench
Piston ring refitting tool
Piston ring compressor
Vibration damper refitting tool
Short lengths of rubber or plastic hose to fit
over connecting rod bolts (where
applicable)
Plastigage
Feeler gauges
A fine-tooth file
New engine oil
Engine assembly oil or molybdenum
disulphide (“moly”) grease
Gasket sealant
Thread-locking compound
2 In order to save time and avoid problems,
engine reassembly should be done in the
following general order:
Piston rings
Crankshaft and main bearings
Piston/connecting rod assemblies
Oil pump
Sump
Cylinder head assembly
Timing belt or chain and tensioner 
assemblies
Water pump
Timing belt or chain covers
Intake and exhaust manifolds
Valve cover
Engine rear plate
Flywheel/driveplate
22 Piston rings - refitting 2
1 Before fitting the new piston rings, the ring
end gaps must be checked. It’s assumed that
the piston ring side clearance has been
checked and verified (see Section 18).
2 Lay out the piston/connecting rod
assemblies and the new ring sets, so that the
ring sets will be matched with the same piston
and cylinder during the end gap measurement
and engine assembly.
3 Insert the top ring into the first cylinder, and
square it up with the cylinder walls by pushing
it in with the top of the piston (see illustration).
The ring should be near the bottom of the
cylinder, at the lower limit of ring travel.
4 To measure the end gap, slip feeler gauges
between the ends of the ring until a gauge equal
to the gap width is found (see illustration). The
feeler gauge should slide between the ring ends
with a slight amount of drag. Compare the
measurement to this Chapter’s Specifications.
If the gap is larger or smaller than specified,
double-check to make sure you have the
correct rings before proceeding.
5 If the gap is too small, it must be enlarged,
or the ring ends may come in contact with
each other during engine operation, which
can cause serious damage to the engine. The
end gap can be increased by filing the ring
ends very carefully with a fine file. Mount the

file in a vice, and file the ring ends (from
the outside in only) to enlarge the gap
slightly

ring over the file, with the ends contacting the
file face, and slowly move the ring to remove
material from the ends. When performing this
operation, file only from the outside in (see
6 Excess end gap isn’t critical unless it’s
greater than 1.0 mm. Again, double-check to
make sure you have the correct rings for your
engine.
7 Repeat the procedure for each ring that will
be fitted in the first cylinder and for each ring
in the remaining cylinders. Remember to keep
rings, pistons and cylinders matched up.
8 Once the ring end gaps have been
checked/corrected, the rings can be fitted on
the pistons.
9 The oil control ring (lowest one on the
piston) is usually fitted first. It’s normally
composed of three separate components.
Slip the spacer/expander into the groove (see
illustration). If an anti-rotation tang is used,
make sure it’s inserted into the drilled hole in
the ring groove. Next, refit the lower side rail.
Don’t use a piston ring refitting tool on the oil
ring side rails, as they may be damaged.
Instead, place one end of the side rail into the
groove between the spacer/expander and the
ring land, hold it firmly in place, and slide a
finger around the piston while pushing the rail
into the groove (see illustration). Next, refit
the upper side rail in the same manner.
10 After the three oil ring components have
been fitted, check to make sure that both the
upper and lower side rails can be turned
smoothly in the ring groove.
11 The middle ring is fitted next. It’s usually
stamped with a mark which must face up,
towards the top of the piston. Note: Always
follow the instructions printed on the ring
package or box - different manufacturers may
require different approaches. Do not mix up
the top and middle rings, as they have
different cross-sections.
12 Make sure the identification mark is facing
the top of the piston, then slip the ring into the
middle groove on the piston (see illus-
tration 18.2). Don’t expand the ring any more
than necessary to slide it over the piston. Use
a proper ring-fitting tool if available; with care,
old feeler gauges can be used to prevent the
rings dropping into empty grooves.
13 Refit the top ring in the same manner.
Make sure the mark is facing upwards. Be
careful not to confuse the top and middle
rings.
14 Repeat the procedure for the remaining
pistons and rings.
23 Intermediate shaft - refitting 5
1 Clean the intermediate shaft bearing
surfaces and the pressed-in bearing sleeves
in the cylinder block.
2 Lubricate the shaft, and slide it into the
block.
3 Refit the two bolts that hold the retaining
plate to the block.
4 The remainder of the parts are fitted in the
reverse order of removal.
24 Crankshaft - refitting and
main bearing oil clearance
check
4
1 Crankshaft refitting is the first major step in
engine reassembly. It’s assumed at this point
that the engine block and crankshaft have
been cleaned, inspected, and repaired or
reconditioned.
2 Position the block upside-down.
3 Remove the main bearing cap bolts, and lift
out the caps. Lay them out in the proper order
to ensure correct refitting.
4 If they’re still in place, remove the original
bearing shells from the block and the main
bearing caps. Wipe the bearing surfaces of
the block and caps with a clean, lint-free
cloth. They must be kept spotlessly-clean.
Main bearing oil clearance
check
5 Clean the back sides of the new main
bearing shells, and lay one in each main
bearing saddle in the block. If one of the
bearing shells from each set has a large
groove in it, make sure the grooved shell is
fitted in the block. Lay the other bearing from
each set in the corresponding main bearing
cap. Make sure the tab on the bearing shell
fits into the recess in the block or cap. 
Caution: The oil holes in the
block must line up with the oil
holes in the bearing shell. Do not
hammer the bearing into place,
and don’t nick or gouge the bearing faces.
No lubrication should be used at this time.
6 The flanged thrust bearing must be fitted in
the No 3 bearing cap and saddle in the M10
engine, in the No 6 bearing cap and saddle in
the M20 engine (see illustration), in the No 4
bearing cap and saddle in the M30 engine,
and in the No 4 bearing saddle only in the
M40 engine.
7 Clean the faces of the bearings in the block
and the crankshaft main bearing journals with
a clean, lint-free cloth.
8 Check or clean the oil holes in the
crankshaft, as any dirt here can go only one
way - straight through the new bearings.
9 Once you’re certain the crankshaft is clean,
carefully lay it in position in the main bearings.
10 Before the crankshaft can be permanently
fitted, the main bearing oil clearance must be
checked.
11 Cut several pieces of the appropriate-size
Plastigage (they must be slightly shorter than
the width of the main bearings), and place one
piece on each crankshaft main bearing
journal, parallel with the crankshaft centreline
(see illustration).
12 Clean the faces of the bearings in the
caps, and refit the caps in their respective

24.6  Refitting a thrust main bearing (note
the flanges) in the engine block bearing


positions (don’t mix them up) with the arrows
pointing towards the front of the engine. Don’t
disturb the Plastigage.
13 Starting with the centre main bearing and
working out toward the ends, progressively
tighten the main bearing cap bolts to the
torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
On M10, M20 and M30 engines, tighten the
bolts in three stages. On the M40 engine,
tighten all the bolts initially to the Stage 1
torque, then angle-tighten them by the angle
given in the Specifications. Carry out the
angle-tightening on each bolt in one
controlled movement. Don’t rotate the
crankshaft at any time during the tightening
operation.
14 Remove the bolts and carefully lift off the
main bearing caps. Keep them in order. Don’t
disturb the Plastigage or rotate the
crankshaft. If any of the main bearing caps are
difficult to remove, tap them gently from side-
to-side with a soft-face hammer to loosen
them.
15 Compare the width of the crushed
Plastigage on each journal to the scale printed
on the Plastigage envelope to obtain the main
bearing oil clearance (see illustration). Check
the Specifications to make sure it’s correct.
16 If the clearance is not as specified, the
bearing shells may be the wrong size (which
means different ones will be required). Before
deciding that different shells are needed,
make sure that no dirt or oil was between the
bearing shells and the caps or block when the
clearance was measured. If the Plastigage
was wider at one end than the other, the
journal may be tapered (see Section 19).
17 Carefully scrape all traces of the
Plastigage material off the main bearing
journals and/or the bearing faces. Use your
fingernail or the edge of a credit card - don’t
nick or scratch the bearing faces.
Final crankshaft refitting
18 Carefully lift the crankshaft out of the
engine.
19 Clean the bearing faces in the block, then
apply a thin, uniform layer of molybdenum
disulphide (“moly”) grease or engine oil to
each of the bearing surfaces. Be sure to coat
the thrust faces as well as the journal face of
the thrust bearing.
20 Make sure the crankshaft journals are
clean, then lay the crankshaft back in place in
the block.
21 Clean the faces of the bearings in the
caps, then apply engine oil to them.
22 Refit the caps in their respective
positions, with the arrows pointing towards
the front of the engine.
23 Refit the bolts finger-tight.
24 Lightly tap the ends of the crankshaft
forward and backward with a lead or brass
hammer, to line up the main bearing and
crankshaft thrust surfaces.
25 Tighten the bearing cap bolts to the
specified torque, working from the centre
outwards. On M10, M20 and M30 engines,
tighten the bolts in three stages to the final
torque, leaving out the thrust bearing cap
bolts at this stage. On M40 engines, tighten all
of the bolts in the two stages given in the
Specifications.
26 On M10, M20 and M30 engines, tighten
the thrust bearing cap bolts to the torque
listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
27 On manual transmission models, fit a new
pilot bearing in the end of the crankshaft (see
Chapter 8).
28 Rotate the crankshaft a number of times
by hand to check for any obvious binding.
29 The final step is to check the crankshaft
endfloat with a feeler gauge or a dial indicator
as described in Section 13. The endfloat
should be correct, providing the crankshaft
thrust faces aren’t worn or damaged, and new
bearings have been fitted.
30 Fit the new seal, then bolt the housing to
the block (see Section 25).
25 Crankshaft rear oil seal -
refitting 3
1 The crankshaft must be fitted first, and the
main bearing caps bolted in place. The new
seal should then be fitted in the retainer, and
the retainer bolted to the block.
2 Before refitting the crankshaft, check the
seal contact surface very carefully for
scratches and nicks that could damage the
new seal lip and cause oil leaks. If the
crankshaft is damaged, the only alternative is
a new or different crankshaft, unless a
machine shop can suggest a means of repair.
3 The old seal can be removed from the
housing with a hammer and punch by driving
it out from the back side (see illustration). Be
sure to note how far it’s recessed into the
housing bore before removing it; the new seal
will have to be recessed an equal amount. Be
very careful not to scratch or otherwise
damage the bore in the housing, or oil leaks
could develop.
4 Make sure the retainer is clean, then apply
a thin coat of engine oil to the outer edge of
the new seal. The seal must be pressed
squarely into the housing bore, so hammering
it into place is not recommended. At the very
least, use a block of wood as shown, or a
section of large-diameter pipe (see
illustration). If you don’t have access to a
press, sandwich the housing and seal
between two smooth pieces of wood, and
press the seal into place with the jaws of a
large vice. The pieces of wood must be thick
enough to distribute the force evenly around
the entire circumference of the seal. Work
2B•20 General engine overhaul procedures
25.5  Lubricate the lip of the seal, and bolt
the retainer to the rear of the engine block
25.4  Drive the new seal into the retainer
with a wooden block or a section of pipe, if
you have one large enough - make sure
the seal enters the retainer bore squarely
25.3  After removing the retainer from the
block, support it on two wooden blocks,
and drive out the old seal with a punch and
hammer
24.15  Compare the width of the crushed
Plastigage to the scale on the envelope to
determine the main bearing oil clearance
(always take the measurement at the
widest point of the Plastigage); be sure to
use the correct scale - standard and
metric ones are included


slowly, and make sure the seal enters the bore
5 The seal lips must be lubricated with multi-
purpose grease or clean engine oil before the
seal/retainer is slipped over the crankshaft
and bolted to the block (see illustration). Use
a new gasket - no sealant is required - and
make sure the dowel pins are in place before
refitting the retainer.
6 Tighten the retainer nuts/screws a little at a
time until they’re all snug, then tighten them to
the torque listed in the Specifications in
Chapter 2A.
26 Pistons/connecting rods -
refitting and big-end bearing
oil clearance check
4
1 Before refitting the piston/connecting rod
assemblies, the cylinder walls must be
perfectly clean, the top edge of each cylinder
must be chamfered, and the crankshaft must
be in place.
2 Remove the cap from the end of No 1
connecting rod (refer to the marks made
during removal). Remove the original bearing
shells, and wipe the bearing surfaces of the
connecting rod and cap with a clean, lint-free
cloth. They must be kept spotlessly-clean.
Connecting rod big-end bearing
oil clearance check
3 Clean the back side of the new upper
bearing shell, then lay it in place in the
connecting rod. Make sure the tab on the
bearing fits into the recess in the rod. Don’t
hammer the bearing shell into place, and be
very careful not to nick or gouge the bearing
face. Don’t lubricate the bearing at this time.
4 Clean the back side of the other bearing
shell, and refit it in the rod cap. Again, make
sure the tab on the bearing fits into the recess
in the cap, and don’t apply any lubricant. It’s
critically important that the mating surfaces of
the bearing and connecting rod are perfectly
clean and oil-free when they’re assembled for
this check.
5 Position the piston ring gaps so they’re
staggered 120° from each other.
6 Where applicable, slip a section of plastic
or rubber hose over each connecting rod cap
bolt.
7 Lubricate the piston and rings with clean
engine oil, and attach a piston ring
compressor to the piston. Leave the skirt
protruding about 6 or 7 mm to guide the
piston into the cylinder. The rings must be
compressed until they’re flush with the piston.
8 Rotate the crankshaft until the No 1
connecting rod journal is at BDC (bottom
dead centre). Apply a coat of engine oil to the
cylinder walls.
9 With the mark or notch on top of the piston
facing the front of the engine, gently insert the
piston/connecting rod assembly into the No 1
cylinder bore, and rest the bottom edge of the
ring compressor on the engine block.
10 Tap the top edge of the ring compressor
to make sure it’s contacting the block around
its entire circumference.
11 Gently tap on the top of the piston with
the end of a wooden hammer handle (see
illustration) while guiding the end of the
connecting rod into place on the crankshaft
journal. Work slowly, and if any resistance is
felt as the piston enters the cylinder, stop
immediately. Find out what’s catching, and fix
it before proceeding. Do not, for any reason,
force the piston into the cylinder - you might
break a ring and/or the piston.
12 Once the piston/connecting rod assembly
is fitted, the connecting rod big-end bearing
oil clearance must be checked before the rod
cap is permanently bolted in place.
13 Cut a piece of the appropriate-size
Plastigage slightly shorter than the width of
the connecting rod big-end bearing, 
and lay it in place on the No 1 connecting rod
journal, parallel with the crankshaft centre-
line.
14 Clean the connecting rod cap bearing
face, remove the protective hoses from the
connecting rod bolts, and refit the rod cap.
Make sure the mating mark on the cap is on
the same side as the mark on the connecting
rod.
15 Refit the nuts/bolts, and tighten them to
the torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifica-
tions. On M10 and M30 engines, work up to
the final torque in three stages. Note: Use a
thin-wall socket, to avoid erroneous torque
readings that can result if the socket is
wedged between the rod cap and nut. If the
socket tends to wedge itself between the nut
and the cap, lift up on it slightly until it no
longer contacts the cap. Do not rotate the
crankshaft at any time during this operation.
16 Undo the nuts and remove the rod cap,
being very careful not to disturb the
Plastigage.
17 Compare the width of the crushed
Plastigage to the scale printed on the
Plastigage envelope to obtain the oil
clearance (see illustration). Compare it to the
Specifications to make sure the clearance is
correct.
18 If the clearance is not as specified, the
bearing shells may be the wrong size (which
means different ones will be required). Before
deciding that different shells are needed,
make sure that no dirt or oil was between the
bearing shells and the connecting rod or cap
when the clearance was measured. Also,
recheck the journal diameter. If the Plastigage
was wider at one end than the other, the
journal may be tapered (see Section 19).
Final connecting rod refitting
19 Carefully scrape all traces of the
Plastigage material off the rod journal and/or
bearing face. Be very careful not to scratch

entering the cylinder bore, so
keep some downward pressure on the

the bearing - use your fingernail or the edge of
a credit card.
20 Make sure the bearing faces are perfectly
clean, then apply a uniform layer of
molybdenum disulphide (“moly”) grease or
engine assembly oil to both of them. You’ll
have to push the piston into the cylinder to
expose the face of the bearing shell in the
connecting rod - be sure to slip the protective
hoses over the rod bolts first, where
applicable.
21 Slide the connecting rod back into place
on the journal, and remove the protective
hoses from the rod cap bolts. Refit the rod
cap, and tighten the nuts/bolts to the
specified torque.
22 Repeat the entire procedure for the
remaining pistons/connecting rods.
23 The important points to remember are:
a) Keep the back sides of the bearing shells
and the insides of the connecting rods
and caps perfectly clean when
assembling them.
b) Make sure you have the correct
piston/rod assembly for each cylinder.
c) The notch or mark on the piston must
face the front of the engine.
d) Lubricate the cylinder walls with clean oil.
e) Lubricate the bearing faces when refitting
the rod caps after the oil clearance has
been checked.
24 After all the piston/connecting rod
assemblies have been properly fitted, rotate
the crankshaft a number of times by hand to
check for any obvious binding.
25 Check the connecting rod side play (see
Section 13).
26 Compare the measured side play to the
Specifications to make sure it’s correct. If it
was correct before dismantling, and the
original crankshaft and rods were refitted, it
should still be right. If new rods or a new
crankshaft were fitted, the side play may be
incorrect. If so, the rods will have to be
removed and taken to a machine shop for
attention.
27 Initial start-up and running-
in after overhaul 1
Warning: Have a fire extinguisher
handy when starting the engine
for the first time.
1 Once the engine has been refitted in the
vehicle, double-check the engine oil and
coolant levels.
2 With the spark plugs removed and the
ignition system disabled (see Section 3), crank
the engine until oil pressure registers on the
gauge, or until the oil pressure warning light
goes out.
3 Refit the spark plugs, connect the HT leads,
and restore the ignition system functions (see
Section 3).
4 Start the engine. It may take a few
moments for the fuel system to build up
pressure, but the engine should start without
a great deal of effort. Note: If backfiring
occurs through the throttle body or
carburettor, check the valve timing (check that
the timing chain/belt has been correctly fitted),
the firing order (check the fitted order of the
spark plug HT leads), and the ignition timing.
5 After the engine starts, it should be allowed
to warm up to normal operating temperature.
While the engine is warming up, make a
thorough check for fuel, oil and coolant leaks.
6 Shut the engine off and recheck the engine
oil and coolant levels.
7 Drive the vehicle to an area with minimum
traffic, accelerate at full throttle from 30 to 
50 mph, then lift off the throttle completely,
and allow the vehicle to slow to 30 mph with
the throttle closed. Repeat the procedure 
10 or 12 times. This will load the piston rings,
and cause them to seat properly against the
cylinder walls. Check again for oil and coolant
leaks.
8 Drive the vehicle gently for the first 
500 miles (no sustained high speeds) and
keep a constant check on the oil level. It is not
unusual for an engine to use oil during the
running-in period.
9 At approximately 500 to 600 miles, change
the oil and filter.
10 For the next few hundred miles, drive the
vehicle normally - don’t nurse it, but don’t
abuse it, either.
11 After 2000 miles, change the oil and filter
again. The engine may now be considered to
be fully run-in.

2A•2 In-car engine repair procedures


1 General information
This Part of Chapter 2 is devoted to in-
vehicle engine repair procedures. All
information concerning engine removal and
refitting and engine block and cylinder head
overhaul can be found in Chapter 2B.
The following repair procedures are based
on the assumption that the engine is still fitted
in the vehicle. If the engine has been removed
from the vehicle and mounted on a stand,
many of the steps outlined in this Part of
Chapter 2 will not apply.
The Specifications included in this Part of
Chapter 2 apply only to the procedures
contained in this Part. Chapter 2B contains
the Specifications necessary for cylinder head
and engine block rebuilding.
The single overhead camshaft four- and
six-cylinder engines covered in this manual
are very similar in design. Where there are
differences, they will be pointed out.
The means by which the overhead
camshaft is driven varies according to engine
type; M10 and M30 engines use a timing
chain, while M20 and M40 engines have a
timing belt.
2 Repair operations possible
with the engine in the vehicle
Many major repair operations can be
accomplished without removing the engine
from the vehicle.
Clean the engine compartment and the
exterior of the engine with some type of
degreaser before any work is done. It will
make the job easier, and help keep dirt out of
the internal areas of the engine.
Depending on the components involved, it
may be helpful to remove the bonnet to
improve access to the engine as repairs are
performed (see Chapter 11 if necessary).
Cover the wings to prevent damage to the
paint. Special pads are available, but an old
bedspread or blanket will also work.
If vacuum, exhaust, oil or coolant leaks
develop, indicating a need for gasket or seal
renewal, the repairs can generally be made
with the engine in the vehicle. The intake and
exhaust manifold gaskets, sump gasket,
crankshaft oil seals and cylinder head gasket
are all accessible with the engine in place.
Exterior components, such as the intake
and exhaust manifolds, the sump, the oil
pump, the water pump, the starter motor, the
alternator, the distributor and the fuel system
components, can be removed for repair with
the engine in place.
The cylinder head can be removed without
removing the engine, so this procedure is
covered in this Part of Chapter 2. Camshaft,
rocker arm and valve component servicing is
most easily accomplished with the cylinder
head removed; these procedures are covered
in Part B of this Chapter. Note, however, that
the camshaft on the M40 engine may be
removed with the engine in the vehicle since it
is retained by bearing caps.
In extreme cases caused by a lack of
necessary equipment, repair or renewal of
piston rings, pistons, connecting rods and
big-end bearings is possible with the engine in
the vehicle. However, this practice is not
recommended, because of the cleaning and
preparation work that must be done to the
components involved.
3 Top Dead Centre (TDC) for
No 1 piston - locating 2
Note 1: The following procedure is based on
the assumption that the distributor (if
applicable) is correctly fitted. If you are trying
to locate TDC to refit the distributor correctly,
piston position must be determined by feeling
for compression at the No 1 spark plug hole,
then aligning the ignition timing marks or
inserting the timing tool in the flywheel, as
applicable.
Note 2: The No 1 cylinder is the one closest to
the radiator.
1 Top Dead Centre (TDC) is the highest point
in the cylinder that each piston reaches as it
travels up and down when the crankshaft
turns. Each piston reaches TDC on the
compression stroke and again on the exhaust
stroke, but TDC generally refers to piston
position on the compression stroke.
2 Positioning the piston at TDC is an essential
part of many procedures, such as timing belt
or chain removal and distributor removal. 
3 Before beginning this procedure, be sure to
place the transmission in Neutral, and apply
the handbrake or chock the rear wheels. Also,
disable the ignition system by detaching the
coil wire from the centre terminal of the
distributor cap, and earthing it on the engine
block with a jumper wire. Remove the spark
plugs (see Chapter 1).
4 In order to bring any piston to TDC, the
crankshaft must be turned using one of the
methods outlined below. When looking at the
front of the engine, normal crankshaft rotation
is clockwise.
(a) The preferred method is to turn the
crankshaft with a socket and ratchet
attached to the bolt threaded into the
front of the crankshaft.
(b) A remote starter switch, which may save
some time, can also be used. Follow the
instructions included with the switch.
Once the piston is close to TDC, use a
socket and ratchet as described in the
previous paragraph.
(c) If an assistant is available to turn the
ignition switch to the Start position in
short bursts, you can get the piston close
to TDC without a remote starter switch.
Make sure your assistant is out of the
vehicle, away from the ignition switch,
then use a socket and ratchet as
described in (a) to complete the
procedure.
5 Note the position of the terminal for the 
No 1 spark plug lead on the distributor cap. If
the terminal isn’t marked, follow the plug lead
from the No 1 cylinder spark plug to the cap
(No 1 cylinder is nearest the radiator).
6 Use a felt-tip pen or chalk to make a mark
directly below the No 1 terminal on the
distributor body or timing cover.
7 Detach the distributor cap, and set it aside
(see Chapter 1 if necessary).
8 Turn the crankshaft (see paragraph 4
above) until the timing marks (located at the
front of the engine) are aligned (see
illustration). The M40 engine does not have
any timing marks at the front of the engine,
but instead has a timing hole in the flywheel
which must be aligned with a hole in the rear
flange of the cylinder block. On this engine,
turn the crankshaft until the distributor rotor is
approaching the No 1 TDC position, then
continue to turn the crankshaft until a suitable
close-fitting drill can be inserted through the
hole in the cylinder block and into the
flywheel.
9 Look at the distributor rotor - it should be
pointing directly at the mark you made on the
distributor body or timing cover.
10 If the rotor is 180 degrees out, the No 1
piston is at TDC on the exhaust stroke.
11 To get the piston to TDC on the
compression stroke, turn the crankshaft one
complete turn (360°) clockwise. The rotor
should now be pointing at the mark on the
distributor or timing cover. When the rotor is
pointing at the No 1 spark plug lead terminal
in the distributor cap and the ignition timing
marks are aligned, the No 1 piston is at TDC
on the compression stroke. Note: If it’s
impossible to align the ignition timing marks
when the rotor is pointing at the mark, the
timing belt or chain may have jumped the
teeth on the sprockets, or may have been
fitted incorrectly.
In-car engine repair procedures  2A•3
3.8  Align the notch in the pulley with the
notch on the timing plate, then check to
see if the distributor rotor is pointing to the
No 1 cylinder (if not, the camshaft is 180
degrees out - the crankshaft will have to
be rotated 360 degrees)


12 After the No 1 piston has been positioned
at TDC on the compression stroke, TDC for
any of the remaining pistons can be located
by turning the crankshaft and following the
firing order. Mark the remaining spark plug
lead terminal locations just like you did for the
No 1 terminal, then number the marks to
correspond with the cylinder numbers. As you
turn the crankshaft, the rotor will also turn.
When it’s pointing directly at one of the marks
on the distributor, the piston for that particular
cylinder is at TDC on the compression stroke.
4 Valve cover - 
removal and refitting 1
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
2 Detach the breather hose from the valve
cover.
3 On M20 engines, unbolt and remove the
intake manifold support bracket and, if
applicable, the bracket for the engine sensors
or idle air stabiliser (it will probably be
necessary to disconnect the electrical
connectors from the sensors and stabiliser).
4 On M30 engines, disconnect the electrical
connector for the airflow sensor. Unclip the
electrical harness, moving it out of the way.
5 Where necessary on M30 engines, remove
the hoses and fittings from the intake air hose,
then loosen the clamp and separate the hose
from the throttle body. Unscrew the mounting
nuts for the air cleaner housing, and remove
the housing together with the air hose and
airflow sensor.
6 Remove the valve cover retaining nuts and
washers (see illustrations). Where necessary,
disconnect the spark plug lead clip or cover
from the stud(s), and set it aside. It will usually
not be necessary to disconnect the leads from
the spark plugs.
7 Remove the valve cover and gasket.
Discard the old gasket. On the M40 engine,
also remove the camshaft cover (see
illustrations). If applicable, remove the semi-
circular rubber seal from the cut-out at the
front of the cylinder head.
Refitting
8 Using a scraper, remove all traces of old
gasket material from the sealing surfaces of
the valve cover and cylinder head.
Caution: Be very careful not to
scratch or gouge the delicate
aluminium surfaces. Gasket
removal solvents are available at
motor factors, and may prove helpful.
After all gasket material has been
removed, the gasket surfaces can be
degreased by wiping them with a rag
dampened with a suitable solvent.
9 If applicable, place a new semi-circular
rubber seal in the cut-out at the front of the
cylinder head, then apply RTV-type gasket
sealant to the joints between the seal and the
mating surface for the valve cover gasket.
Note: After the sealant is applied, you should
refit the valve cover and tighten the nuts within
ten minutes.
10 Refit the camshaft cover (M40 engine), the
valve cover and a new gasket. Refit the
washers and nuts; tighten the nuts evenly and
securely. Don’t overtighten these nuts - they
should be tight enough to prevent oil from
leaking past the gasket, but not so tight that
they warp the valve cover.
11 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal.
5 Intake manifold - 
removal and refitting 2
Removal
1 Allow the engine to cool completely, then
relieve the fuel pressure on fuel-injection
engines (see Chapter 4).
2 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
3 Drain the engine coolant (see Chapter 1)
below the level of the intake manifold. If the
coolant is in good condition, it can be saved
and reused.
4 On fuel injection engines, loosen the hose
clamp and disconnect the large air inlet hose
from the throttle body. It may also be
necessary to remove the entire air
cleaner/inlet hose assembly to provide
enough working room (see Chapter 4).

6 Disconnect the coolant hoses from the
throttle body/intake manifold as applicable.
7 Disconnect the throttle cable and, if
applicable, cruise control cable (see Chap-
8 Remove the EGR valve and line where
applicable (see Chapter 6).
9 At this stage on the M40 engine, the upper
part of the intake manifold should be removed
by unscrewing the bolts and nuts. Remove
the gaskets (see illustrations).
10 On fuel injection engines, disconnect the
vacuum hose from the fuel pressure regulator,
and disconnect the electrical connectors from
the fuel injectors (see Chapter 4).
11 Disconnect the fuel lines from the fuel rail
or carburettor, as applicable (see Chapter 4). 
12 On the M40 engine, unbolt and remove
the support bracket from the bottom of the
intake manifold (see illustration).
13 Disconnect all remaining hoses and wires
attached between the intake manifold/throttle
body assembly and the engine or chassis.
14 Remove the bolts and/or nuts that attach
the manifold to the cylinder head (see
illustrations). Start at the ends and work
toward the middle, loosening each one a little
at a time until they can be removed by hand.
Support the manifold while removing the
fasteners so it doesn’t fall. Note: You can
remove the manifold without removing the
throttle body, injectors, vacuum/thermo
valves, fuel pressure regulator or carburettor.
If you’re fitting a new manifold, transfer the
components (see Chapter 4) and lines to the
new manifold before it is fitted on the cylinder
head.
15 Move the manifold up and down to break
the gasket seal, then lift it away from the head
and remove the gasket (see illustrations).
Refitting
16 Remove the old gasket, then carefully
scrape all traces of sealant off the head and
the manifold mating surfaces. Be very careful
not to nick or scratch the delicate aluminium
mating surfaces. Gasket removal solvents are
available at motor factors, and may prove
helpful. Make sure the surfaces are perfectly
clean and free of dirt and oil.
17 Check the manifold for corrosion (at the
coolant passages), cracks, warping and other
damage. Cracks and warping normally show
up near the gasket surface, around the stud
holes. If defects are found, have the manifold
repaired (or renew it, as necessary).
18 When refitting the manifold, always use a
new gasket. Where one side of the gasket has
a graphite surface, this must face the cylinder
head.
19 Refit the nuts and bolts and tighten them
gradually, working from the centre out to the
ends, to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications.
20 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal. On the M40 engine, renew the
gaskets between the upper and lower parts of
the manifold.

6 Exhaust manifold - 
removal and refitting 1
Warning: Make sure the engine is
completely cool before beginning
work on the exhaust system.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
2 On models where the air cleaner is on the
exhaust manifold side of the engine, remove
the air cleaner housing assembly and/or
airflow sensor to provide sufficient working
area (see Chapter 4, if necessary).
3 Unplug the HT leads and set the spark plug
lead harness aside (see Chapter 1). 
4 Clearly label, then disconnect or remove, all
wires, hoses, fittings, etc. that are in the way.
Be sure to disconnect the oxygen sensor,
where fitted.
5 Raise the vehicle, and support it securely
on axle stands. Working from under the
vehicle, separate the exhaust downpipe from
the manifold. Use penetrating oil on the
fasteners to ease removal (see illustrations).
6 Remove the axle stands, and lower the
vehicle. Working from the ends of the
manifold toward the centre, loosen the
retaining nuts gradually until they can be
removed. Again, penetrating oil may prove
helpful.
7 Pull the manifold off the head, then remove
the old gaskets (see illustrations). Note: Be
very careful not to damage the oxygen sensor,
where fitted.
8 Clean the gasket mating surfaces of the
head and manifold, and make sure the
threads on the exhaust manifold studs are in
good condition.
9 Check for corrosion, warping, cracks, and
other damage. Repair or renew the manifold
as necessary.
10 When refitting the manifold, use new
gaskets. Tighten the manifold-to-head
retaining nuts gradually, starting at the centre
and working out to the ends, to the torque
listed in this Chapter’s Specifications. Also
tighten the downpipe-to-manifold nuts.
11 The remaining steps are simply a reversal
of the removal procedure.
7 Timing chain covers -
removal and refitting 5
Note 1: This procedure applies to M10 and
M30 engines.
Note 2: The upper timing chain cover can be
removed separately. If you need to remove
both the upper and lower covers, special tools
are required. Read paragraphs 8 and 9 before
beginning work. 
Removal
1 Disconnect the battery negative cable.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code before
disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
2 If you’re removing the lower timing chain
cover (the upper cover can be removed
separately), remove the cooling fan and fan
shroud, the radiator and the fan drivebelt
pulley (see Chapter 3).
3 On the M10 engine only, remove the water
pump (see Chapter 3).
4 On engines where the distributor cap is
mounted directly to the timing chain cover,
remove the cap, rotor and the black plastic
cover beneath the rotor (see Chapter 1).
5 On the M30 engine fitted with the 
L-Jetronic fuel system, remove the 
distributor from the upper timing cover (see
Chapter 5).
6 Remove the valve cover (see Section 4).
7 If you’ll be removing the lower timing chain
cover on the M30 engine, remove the crankshaft
pulley from the vibration damper/hub. Hold the
pulley stationary with a socket on the centre
bolt, and remove the pulley bolts with another
socket (see illustration).
8 If you’ll be removing the lower timing chain
2A•6 In-car engine repair procedures
6.7c  Removing the exhaust manifold-to-
downpipe gasket (M40 engine)

gasket (M40 engine)
6.7a  Removing the exhaust manifold 
(M40 engine)
6.5b  Exhaust manifold-to-downpipe flange
(M40 engine)
6.5a  Remove the exhaust manifold nuts
(arrowed) from the exhaust pipe (M20
engine) - soaking the nuts with penetrating
oil should make them easier to remove
washer reservoir from the
right-hand side of the engine


cover, remove the vibration damper/hub by
locking the crankshaft in position and
loosening the large centre bolt. Since the bolt
is on very tight, you’ll need to use an
extension bar and socket to break it loose. On
M30 engines, BMW recommends using a 
3/4-inch drive socket and extension bar, since
the bolt is extremely tight on these engines.
To lock the crankshaft in place while the bolt
is being loosened, use BMW special tool 
No. 11 2 100 (or equivalent).
9 On the M10 engine, if the special tool listed
in the previous paragraph is not available, you
may try locking the crankshaft by removing
the flywheel/driveplate inspection cover and
jamming a wide-bladed screwdriver into the
ring gear teeth. On the M30 engine, since the
bolt is so extremely tight, we don’t
recommend substitute methods. Use the
correct tool. On the M10 engine, after the
centre bolt is removed, it will probably be
necessary to use a jaw-type puller to pull the
vibration damper off the crankshaft. Position
the jaws behind the inner pulley groove, and
tighten the puller centre bolt very slowly,
checking the pulley to make sure it does not
get bent or otherwise damaged by the puller.
10 Unscrew the plug and remove the timing
chain tensioner spring (see illustration). The
tensioner plunger may come out with the
spring. If not, reach down into the hole where
the tensioner spring was, and remove the
plunger. To check the plunger for proper
operation, see Section 8. 
Caution: The spring is under
tension, and this could cause the
plug to be ejected from its hole with
considerable force. Hold the
tensioner plug securely as it’s being
unscrewed, and release the spring tension
slowly. 
11 On the M30 engine, if you’re removing the
upper timing cover, unbolt the thermostat cover
and remove the thermostat (see Chapter 3).
12 On the M30 engine, if you’re removing the
lower timing cover, loosen the alternator
mounting bolts, and swing the alternator to
one side. Remove the front lower mounting
bracket bolt, and loosen the other bolts. Also
unbolt the power steering pump mounting
bracket, and move it to one side.
13 Remove the bolts and nuts securing the
upper timing chain cover to the engine block,
and remove the cover. Draw a simple diagram
showing the location of the bolts, so they can
be returned to the same holes from which
they’re removed. Remove the upper timing
chain cover. If it sticks to the engine block, tap
it gently with a rubber mallet, or place a piece
of wood against the cover and hit the wood
with a hammer. On the M30 engine fitted with
the L-Jetronic fuel system, remove the
distributor driveshaft.
14 Remove the bolts and nuts attaching the
lower timing chain cover to the engine block.
Be sure to remove the three bolts from
underneath that connect the front of the sump
to the bottom of the front cover (see
illustration). Loosen the remaining sump bolts.
15 Run a sharp, thin knife between the sump
gasket and lower timing chain cover, cutting
the cover free from the gasket. Be very careful
not to damage or dirty the gasket, so you can
re-use it. 
16 Break the lower timing chain cover-to-
block gasket seal by tapping the cover with a
rubber mallet, or with a hammer and block of
wood. Do not prise between the cover and the
engine block, as damage to the gasket sealing
surfaces will result.
17 Using a scraper, remove all traces of old
gasket material from the sealing surfaces of
the covers and engine block.
Caution: Be very careful not to
scratch or gouge the delicate
aluminium surfaces. Also, do not
damage the sump gasket, and
keep it clean. Gasket removal solvents are
available at motor factors, and may prove
helpful. After all gasket material has been
removed, the gasket surfaces can be
degreased by wiping them with a rag
dampened with a suitable solvent.
Refitting
18 Renew the front oil seals (see Section 11).
It’s not wise to take a chance on an old seal,
since renewal with the covers removed is very
easy. Be sure to apply a little oil to the front oil
seal lips.
19 Apply a film of RTV-type gasket sealant to
the surface of the sump gasket that mates
with the lower timing chain cover. Apply extra
beads of RTV sealant to the edges where the
gasket meets the engine block. Note: If the
sump gasket is damaged, instead of fitting a
whole new gasket, you might try trimming the
front portion of the gasket off at the point
where it meets the engine block, then trim off
the front portion of a new sump gasket so it’s
exactly the same size. Cover the exposed
inside area of the sump with a rag, then clean
all traces of old gasket material off the area
where the gasket was removed. Attach the
new gasket piece to the sump with contact-
cement-type gasket adhesive, then apply
RTV-type sealant as described at the
beginning of this paragraph.
20 Coat both sides of the new gasket with
RTV-type gasket sealant, then attach the
lower timing chain cover to the front of the
engine. Refit the bolts, and tighten them
evenly to the torque listed in this Chapter’s
Specifications. Work from bolt-to-bolt in a
criss-cross pattern to be sure they’re
tightened evenly. Note 1: Tighten the lower
cover-to-block bolts first, then tighten the
sump-to-cover bolts. If the gasket protrudes
above the cover-to-block joint, or bunches up
at the cover-to-sump joint, trim the gasket so
it fits correctly. Note 2: After applying RTV-
type sealant, reassembly must be completed
in about 10 minutes so the RTV won’t
prematurely harden.
21 Refit the upper timing chain cover in the
same way as the lower cover. If the gasket
protrudes beyond the top of the cover and the

8 Timing chain and 
sprockets - removal,
inspection and refitting
Note: This procedure applies to M10 and M30
Caution: Once the engine is set
at TDC, do not rotate the
camshaft or crankshaft until the
timing chain is reinstalled. If the
crankshaft or camshaft is rotated with the
timing chain removed, the valves could hit
the pistons, causing expensive internal
engine damage.
Removal
1 Position the No 1 cylinder at Top Dead
Centre (TDC) on the compression stroke (see
Section 3).
2 Remove the valve cover (see Section 4).
Double-check that the No 1 cylinder is at TDC
on the compression stroke by making sure the
No 1 cylinder rocker arms are loose (not
compressing their valve springs).
3 Remove the upper timing chain cover (see
Section 7). Note the location of the camshaft
timing marks, which should now be aligned.
On four-cylinder (M10) engines, there’s
usually a stamped line on the camshaft flange
that aligns with a cast mark on the top of the
cylinder head; also, the camshaft sprocket
dowel pin hole will be at its lowest point. On
six-cylinder (M30) engines, a line drawn
through two of the camshaft sprocket bolts
opposite each other would be exactly vertical,
while a line drawn through the other two bolts
would be horizontal. Additionally, the locating
pin should be in the lower left corner (between
the 7 and 8 o’clock positions). Be sure you’ve
identified the correct camshaft TDC position
before dismantling, because correct valve
timing depends on you aligning them exactly
on reassembly. Note: As the engine is
mounted in the engine compartment at an
angle, all references to horizontal and vertical
whilst timing the camshafts are in relation to
the crankshaft, and not the ground.
4 Hold the crankshaft stationary with a socket
and ratchet on the vibration damper centre bolt,
then loosen (but don’t unscrew completely) the
four bolts attaching the camshaft sprocket to
the camshaft. Be very careful not to rotate the
camshaft or crankshaft. Note: Some earlier
models may have locking tabs for the camshaft
sprocket bolts. Bend the tabs down before
loosening the bolts. The tabs are no longer
available from the manufacturer, and do not
have to be used on refitting.
5 Remove the lower timing chain cover (see
Section 7).
6 Unscrew and remove the four camshaft
sprocket bolts, then disengage the chain from
the crankshaft sprocket and carefully remove
the chain and camshaft sprocket from the
engine. It may be necessary to gently prise
the camshaft sprocket loose from the
camshaft with a screwdriver.
Inspection
Timing sprockets
7 Examine the teeth on both the crankshaft
sprocket and the camshaft sprocket for wear.
Each tooth forms an inverted V. If worn, the
side of each tooth under tension will be
slightly concave in shape when compared
with the other side of the tooth (i.e. one side of
the inverted V will be concave when
compared with the other, giving the teeth a
hooked appearance). If the teeth appear to be
worn, the sprockets must be renewed. Note:
The crankshaft sprocket is a press fit on the
crankshaft, and can be removed with a jaw-
type puller after the Woodruff key and oil
pump are removed (see Section 14). However,
BMW recommends the new sprocket be
pressed onto the crankshaft after being
heated to 80° C (175° F) on the M10 engine, or
to 200° C (390° F) on the M30 engine. For this
reason, if the crankshaft sprocket requires
renewal, we recommend removing the
crankshaft (see Part B of this Chapter) and
taking it to an engineering works to have the
old sprocket pressed off and a new one
pressed on.
Timing chain
8 The chain should be renewed if the
sprockets are worn or if the chain is loose
(indicated by excessive noise in operation).
It’s a good idea to renew the chain anyway if
the engine is stripped down for overhaul. The
rollers on a very badly worn chain may be
slightly grooved. To avoid future problems, if
there’s any doubt at all about the chain’s
condition, renew it.
Chain rail and tensioner
9 Inspect the chain guide rail and tensioner
rail for deep grooves caused by chain contact.
Renew them if they are excessively worn. The
rails can be renewed after removing the
circlips with a pointed tool or needle-nose
pliers (see illustration).
10 Shake the tensioner plunger, and listen for
a rattling sound from the check ball. If you
can’t hear the ball rattling, renew the plunger. 
11 To further check the tensioner plunger,
blow through it first from the closed end, then
from the slotted (guide) end. No air should
flow through the plunger when you blow
through the closed end, and air should flow
through it freely when you blow through the
slotted end. If the tensioner fails either test,
renew it.
Refitting
12 Refit the tensioner rail and chain guide
rail, if removed.
13 Temporarily refit the lower timing chain
cover and vibration damper, so you can check
the crankshaft timing marks. Once you’ve
verified the TDC marks are aligned, remove
the damper and cover.
14 Loop the timing chain over the crankshaft
sprocket, then loop it over the camshaft
sprocket and, guiding the chain between the
chain guide and tensioner rail, refit the
camshaft sprocket on the camshaft. Make
sure the camshaft timing marks are aligned.
15 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal. Be sure to tighten the fasteners to
the correct torques (see this Chapter’s Speci-
fications).

removal, inspection and
refitting
5
Note 1: This procedure applies to M20 and
M40 engines.
Note 2: Before removing the camshaft
sprocket on the M40 engine, it is necessary to
obtain a tool to hold the camshaft for the
refitting procedure (see paragraph 10).
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
Removal
1 Disconnect the negative cable from the
battery.
2 Remove the timing belt covers (see Sec-
tion 9).
3 On the M40 engine, drain the cooling
system (see Chapter 1), then disconnect the
hose, unbolt the thermostat housing and
remove the thermostat (see Chapter 3).
4 Set the No 1 piston at TDC (see Section 3).
Caution: Once the engine is set at
TDC, do not rotate the camshaft
or crankshaft until the timing belt
is refitted. If the crankshaft or
camshaft is rotated with the timing belt
removed, the valves could hit the pistons,
causing expensive internal engine damage.
5 On the M20 engine, the crankshaft mark
should be aligned with the mark on the inner
cover (see illustration). The mark on the
camshaft sprocket should be aligned with the
stamped line on the cylinder head (see
illustration). On the M40 engine, make an

6 On the M20 engine, loosen the two
tensioner roller retaining bolts a little, and
push the tensioner towards the water pump
(see illustration). With the timing belt tension
relieved, re-tighten the retaining bolt.
7 On the M40 engine, loosen the tensioner
retaining nut, and use an Allen key to rotate
the tensioner clockwise. This will relieve the
tension of the timing belt. Tighten the
retaining nut to hold the tensioner in its free
position.
8 If the same belt is to be refitted, mark it with
an arrow indicating direction of rotation.
Caution: It is not advisable to
refit a timing belt which has been
removed unless it is virtually
new. On the M40 engine, BMW
recommend that the timing belt is
renewed every time the tensioner roller is
released.
9 Remove the timing belt by slipping it off the
roller(s) and the other sprockets (see
illustrations).
10 If it’s necessary to remove the camshaft
or the intermediate shaft sprocket, remove the
sprocket bolt while holding the sprocket to
prevent it from moving. To hold the sprocket,
wrap it with a piece of an old timing belt
(toothed side engaging the sprocket teeth) or
a piece of leather, then hold the sprocket
using a strap spanner. If a strap spanner is not
available, clamp the ends of the piece of belt
or leather tightly together with a pair of grips.
Before loosening the bolt, make sure you have
the necessary tool for positioning the
camshaft as described in the following
paragraph (see illustration).
Caution: Do not use the timing
belt you’re planning to refit to
hold the sprocket. Also, be sure
to hold the camshaft sprocket
very steady, because if it moves more than
a few degrees, the valves could hit the
pistons.
Note: On the M40 engine, the sprocket is not
directly located on the camshaft with a key, as
the groove in the end of the camshaft allows
the sprocket to move several degrees in either
direction. The retaining bolt locks the sprocket
onto a taper after positioning the camshaft
with a special tool. 
11 The BMW tool for positioning the camshaft
on the M40 engine consists of a metal plate
which locates over the square lug near the No
1 cylinder lobes on the camshaft - the valve
cover must be removed first (see
illustrations). If the BMW tool cannot be
obtained, a home-made tool should be
fabricated out of metal plate. The tool must be
made to hold the square lug on the camshaft
at right-angles to the upper face of the cylinder
head (ie the contact face of the valve cover).
12 If it’s necessary to remove the crankshaft
sprocket, remove the crankshaft hub centre
bolt while holding the crankshaft steady.
Note: The removal of the crankshaft hub
mounting bolt requires a heavy-duty holding
device because of the high torque used to
tighten the bolt. BMW has a special tool,
numbered 112150 (M20 engines) or 112170
(M40 engines), for this purpose. If this tool
cannot be bought or borrowed, check with a
tool dealer or motor factors for a tool capable
of doing the job. Note that the tool number
112170 bolts on the rear of the cylinder head
and engages with the flywheel ring gear, so it
will only be possible to use this tool if the
gearbox has been removed, or if the engine is
out of the vehicle (see illustrations). On

models with a two-piece hub, after removing
the outer hub piece, you’ll then need to
remove the sprocket with a bolt-type puller
(available at most motor factors). When using
the puller, thread the crankshaft centre bolt in
approximately three turns, and use this as a
bearing point for the puller’s centre bolt.
Inspection
13 Check for a cracked, worn or damaged
belt. Renew it if any of these conditions are
found (see illustrations). Also look at the
sprockets for any signs of irregular wear or
damage, indicating the need for renewal.
Note: If any parts are to be renewed, check
with your local BMW dealer parts department
to be sure compatible parts are used. On M20
engines, later sprockets, tensioner rollers and
timing belts are marked “Z 127”. Renewal of
the timing belt on M20 engines will mean that
the later belt tensioner should also be fitted, if
not already done.
14 Inspect the idler roller and, on M20
engines, the tension spring. Rotate the
tensioner roller to be sure it rotates freely, with
no noise or play. Note: When fitting a new
timing belt, it is recommended that a new
tensioner be fitted also.
Refitting
15 On the M20 engine, refit the idler/
tensioner/spring so that the timing belt can be
fitted loosely.
16 Refit the sprockets using a reversal of the
removal procedure; tighten the retaining bolts
to the specified torque. On the M40 engine,
turn the camshaft sprocket clockwise as far
as possible within the location groove, then
tighten the retaining bolt to an initial torque of
1 to 3 Nm at this stage.
17 If you are refitting the old belt, make sure
the mark made to indicate belt direction of
rotation is pointing the right way (the belt
should rotate in a clockwise direction as you
face the front of the engine).
18 Refit the timing belt, placing the belt
under the crankshaft sprocket first to get by
the housing. Guide the belt around the other
sprocket(s).
19 Finally, place the belt over the
idler/tensioner rollers.
20 On the M20 engine, loosen the tensioner
bolts and allow the spring tension to be
applied to the belt.
21 On the M20 engine, lightly apply pressure
behind the tensioner to be sure spring
pressure is being applied to the belt (see
illustration). Don’t tighten the bolts while
applying pressure; lightly tighten the bolts
only after releasing the tensioner.
22 On the M40 engine, unbolt and remove
the valve cover, then use the special tool to
hold the camshaft in the TDC position (see
paragraph 11).
23 On the M40 engine, loosen the tensioner
roller retaining nut, and use an Allen key to
rotate the roller anti-clockwise until the timing
belt is tensioned correctly. The 90°-twist
method of checking the tension of the timing
belt is not accurate enough for this engine,
and it is strongly recommended that the
special BMW tensioning tool is obtained if at
all possible (apply 32 ±2 graduations on the
tool) (see illustration). A reasonably accurate
alternative can be made using an Allen key
and a spring balance (see illustration). Make
sure that the spring balance is positioned as
shown, since the tensioner roller is on an
eccentric, and different readings will be
obtained otherwise. The spring balance
should be connected 85 mm along the Allen
key, and a force of 2.0 kg (4.4 lb) should be

specified torque to hold the tensioner in its
correct position. Note: It is important that the
timing belt is tensioned correctly. If the belt is
over-tightened, it will howl, and there is the
possibility of it being damaged. If the belt is
too slack, it may jump on the sprockets.
24 Check to make sure the camshaft and
crankshaft timing marks are still aligned (see
illustrations 10.5a and 10.5b).
25 Turn the crankshaft clockwise through
two complete revolutions. (Remove the
camshaft positioning tool from the M40
engine first.)
Caution: This is necessary to
stretch the new belt. If not done,
the belt tensioner will be too
loose, and damage could result.
26 On the M20 engine, loosen the tensioner
roller bolts, then tighten them to the torque
listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
27 On the M40 engine, loosen the tensioner
roller retaining nut, and re-adjust the tension
of the timing belt as described in paragraph
23. On completion, tighten the tensioner roller
retaining nut, then fully tighten the camshaft
sprocket bolt if previously loosened (see
illustration).

perfectly aligned. If not, remove and refit the
timing belt.

7 Clean the bore in the cover, and coat the
outer edge of the new seal with engine oil or
multi-purpose grease. Also lubricate the lips
of the seal with multi-purpose grease. Using a
socket with an outside diameter slightly
smaller than the outside diameter of the seal,
carefully drive the new seal into place with a
hammer (see illustration). If a socket isn’t
available, a short section of large-diameter
pipe will work. Check the seal after refitting to
be sure the spring around the inside of the
seal lip didn’t pop out of place.

housing from the cylinder head by pulling it as
you rotate it back and forth.
11 On the M20 engine only, support the
housing on two blocks of wood, and drive the
seal out of the housing from behind using a
hammer and screwdriver. Be very careful not
to damage the seal housing.
12 On the M40 engine, prise the seal out
from the cylinder head using a screwdriver,
being careful not to damage the camshaft
surface or the seal bore.
13 Coat the lip and outside diameter of the
new seal with multi-purpose grease.
14 On the M40 engine, wrap some adhesive
tape around the end of the camshaft to
protect the new seal from the location groove
as it is being fitted (see illustration).
15 Carefully locate the new seal in position,
and press it in by hand initially so that it enters
the bore. Drive the new seal into the housing
or cylinder head (as applicable) using a
hammer and a socket with a diameter slightly
smaller than the outside diameter of the seal.
On the M40 engine, remove the adhesive tape
from the end of the camshaft.
16 On the M20 engine, renew the O-ring on
the back of the seal housing, and work the lip
of the seal over the end of the camshaft. Refit
the screws and tighten them securely.
17 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal.
Crankshaft and intermediate shaft

timing belt be renewed any time it is removed.
19 Remove the bolts and nuts securing the
front cover to the engine block. Be sure to
remove the three bolts from underneath that
connect the front of the sump to the bottom of
the front cover (see illustration 7.14).
20 Run a sharp, thin knife between the sump
gasket and the front cover, cutting the cover
free from the gasket. Be very careful not to
damage the gasket, and keep it clean so you
can re-use it. 
21 Break the front cover-to-block gasket seal
by tapping the cover with a rubber mallet or
block of wood and hammer. Do not prise
between the cover and the engine block, as
damage to the gasket sealing surfaces will
result.

Caution: Be very careful not to
scratch or gouge the delicate
aluminium surfaces. Also, do not
damage the sump gasket, and
keep it clean. Gasket removal solvents are
available at motor factors, and may 
prove helpful. After all gasket material has
been removed, the gasket surfaces 
can be degreased by wiping them 
with a rag dampened with a suitable
solvent.
23 Support the cover on two blocks of wood,
and drive out the seals from behind with a
hammer and screwdriver. Be very careful not
to damage the seal bores in the process.
24 Coat the outside diameters and lips of the
new seals with multi-purpose grease, and
drive the seals into the cover with a hammer
and a socket slightly smaller in diameter than
the outside diameter of the seal.
25 Apply a film of RTV-type gasket sealant to
the surface of the sump gasket that mates
with the front cover. Apply extra beads of RTV
sealant to the edges where the gasket meets
the engine block. Note: If the sump gasket is
damaged, instead of fitting a whole new
gasket, you might try trimming the front
portion of the gasket off at the point where it
meets the engine block, then trim off the front
portion of a new sump gasket so it’s exactly
the same size. Cover the exposed inside area
of the sump with a rag, then clean all traces of
old gasket material off the area where the
gasket was removed. Attach the new gasket
piece to the sump with contact-cement-type
gasket adhesive, then apply RTV-type sealant
as described at the beginning of this
paragraph.
26 Coat both sides of the new gasket with
RTV-type gasket sealant, then attach the front
cover to the front of the engine, carefully
working the seals over the crankshaft and
intermediate shaft. Refit the bolts and tighten
them evenly to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications. Work from bolt-to-
bolt in a criss-cross pattern, to be sure they’re
tightened evenly. Note 1: Tighten the front
cover-to-block bolts first, then tighten the
sump-to-cover bolts. Note 2: After applying
RTV-type sealant, reassembly must be
completed in about 10 minutes so the RTV
won’t prematurely harden.

prise it out from the front cover using a
screwdriver, but take care not to damage the
bore of the cover or the surface of the
crankshaft. If the seal is tight, drill two small
holes in the metal end of the seal, and use two
self-tapping screws to pull out the seal. Make
sure all remains of swarf are removed.
31 Coat the outside diameter and lip of the
new seal with multi-purpose grease, then
drive it into the cover with a hammer and a
socket slightly smaller in diameter than the

Section 4). Remove the semi-circular rubber
seal from the front of the cylinder head, where
this is not incorporated in the valve cover
gasket.
16 Set No 1 piston at Top Dead Centre on
the compression stroke (see Section 3).
17 Remove the timing chain or belt (see
Section 8 or 10). Note: If you want to save
time by not removing and refitting the timing
belt or chain and re-timing the engine, you can
unfasten the camshaft sprocket and suspend
it out of the way - with the belt or chain still
attached - by a piece of rope. Be sure the
rope keeps firm tension on the belt or chain,
so it won’t become disengaged from any of
the sprockets.
18 Loosen the cylinder head bolts a quarter-
turn at a time each, in the reverse of the
tightening sequence shown (see illustrations
12.30a, 12.30b, 12.30c or 12.30d). Do 
not dismantle or remove the rocker arm
assembly at this time on M10, M20 and M30
engines.
19 Remove the cylinder head by lifting it
straight up and off the engine block. Do not
prise between the cylinder head and the
engine block, as damage to the gasket sealing
surfaces may result. Instead, use a blunt bar
positioned in an intake port to gently prise the
head loose.
20 Remove any remaining external
components from the head to allow for
thorough cleaning and inspection. See
Chapter 2B for cylinder head servicing
procedures. On the M40 engine, remove the
rubber O-ring from the groove in the top of the
oil pump/front end cover housing.
Refitting
21 The mating surfaces of the cylinder head
and block must be perfectly clean when the
head is refitted.
22 Use a gasket scraper to remove all traces
of carbon and old gasket material, then clean
the mating surfaces with a suitable solvent. If
there’s oil on the mating surfaces when the
head is refitted, the gasket may not seal
correctly, and leaks could develop. When
working on the block, stuff the cylinders with
clean rags to keep out debris. Use a vacuum
cleaner to remove material that falls into the
cylinders.
23 Check the block and head mating
surfaces for nicks, deep scratches and other
damage. If the damage is slight, it can be
removed with a file; if it’s excessive,
machining may be the only alternative.
24 Use a tap of the correct size to chase the
threads in the head bolt holes, then clean the
holes with compressed air - make sure that
In-car engine repair procedures  2A•13


nothing (including oil, water, etc) remains in
the holes (see illustration).
25 BMW recommend head bolts are renewed,
but if the old ones are re-used, mount each bolt
in a vice, and run a die down the threads to
remove corrosion and restore the threads. Dirt,
corrosion, sealant and damaged threads will
affect torque readings (see illustration). If the
bolts or their threads are damaged, do not re-
use the bolts - fit a new set.
26 Refit any components removed from the
head prior to cleaning and inspection. On the
M40 engine, locate a new rubber O-ring in the
groove in the top of the oil pump/front end
cover housing (see illustration).
27 Make sure the gasket sealing surfaces of
the engine block and cylinder head are clean
and oil-free. Lay the head gasket in place on
the block, with the manufacturer’s stamped
mark facing up (it usually says “UP,” “OBEN”
or something similar). Use the dowel pins in the
top of the block to properly locate the gasket.
28 Carefully set the cylinder head in place
on the block. Use the dowel pins to properly
align it. Where the engine is tilted slightly (ie
M40 engine) you may find it helpful to fit
guide studs to ensure correct positioning of
the cylinder head on the block. Use two old
head bolts, one screwed into each end of
the block. Cut the heads off the bolts, and
use a hacksaw to cut slots in the tops 
of the bolts so they can be removed once
the cylinder head is in position (see
illustration).
29 Fit the cylinder head bolts (see
illustration).
30 Tighten the cylinder head bolts, in the
sequence shown, to the torque listed in this
Chapter’s Specifications (see illustrations).
Note that on some engines the final stage of
tightening takes place after the engine has
been run.
31 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal. Set the valve clearances on M10,
M20 and M30 engines (see Chapter 1) before
refitting the valve cover (check them again
after the engine is warmed-up). Run the
engine and check for leaks.

2 Raise the front of the vehicle and place it
securely on axle stands.
3 Remove the splash shields from under the
4 Where applicable, disconnect the hoses
attached to the sump, and move them to one
side (see illustration).
5 Where applicable, disconnect the oil level
sensor electrical connector (see illustration).
6 Where applicable, remove the cast-
aluminium inspection cover that covers the
rear of the sump (see illustrations).
7 On models with the M40 engine, unbolt and
remove the lower sump section and remove
the gasket (this is necessary for access to the
front mounting bolts). Unscrew the mounting
bolt, and pull the oil dipstick tube from the
sump (see illustrations). Check the condition
of the O-ring, and renew it if necessary.
8 On models with the M40 engine, unscrew
the engine mounting nuts on both sides, then
attach a suitable hoist and lift the engine
sufficiently to allow the sump to be removed.
As a safety precaution, position axle stands or
blocks of wood beneath the engine.
9 Remove the bolts securing the sump to the
engine block and front/rear covers (see
illustration).
10 Tap on the sump with a soft-faced
hammer to break the gasket seal, and lower
the sump from the engine.
11 Using a gasket scraper, scrape off all
traces of the old gasket from the engine
block, the timing chain cover, the rear main oil
seal housing, and the sump. Be especially
careful not to nick or gouge the gasket sealing
surfaces of the timing chain cover and the oil
seal housing (they are made of aluminium,
and are quite soft).
12 Clean the sump with solvent, and dry it
thoroughly. Check the gasket sealing surfaces
for distortion. Clean any residue from the
gasket sealing surfaces on the sump and
engine with a rag dampened with a suitable
solvent.
13 Before refitting the sump, apply a little
RTV-type gasket sealant to the area where the
front and rear covers join the cylinder block..
Lay a new sump gasket in place on the block.
If necessary, apply more sealant to hold the
gasket in place.
14 Carefully position the sump in place (do
not disturb the gasket) and refit the bolts.
Start with the bolts closest to the centre of the
sump, and tighten them to the torque listed in
this Chapter’s Specifications, using a criss-
cross pattern. Do not overtighten them, or
leakage may occur.

section on models with the M40 engine.
16 On completion refill the engine with oil
(Chapter 1). Run the engine and check that
there are no oil leaks from the sump gasket or
other disturbed components.
14 Oil pump - removal,
inspection and refitting 5
Removal
1 Remove the sump (see Section 13).
M10, M20 and M30 engines
2 On M10 and M30 engines, remove the
three bolts that attach the gear to the front of
the pump (see illustration). Note: Some
models have a single centre nut attaching the
gear to the oil pump.
3 Unbolt the oil pump from the engine block
(see illustrations) and remove it.
4 On the M20 engine, the intermediate shaft
drives the oil pump driveshaft, which drives
the oil pump. To remove the driveshaft,
remove the hold-down plate from the block,
and lift out the plug. Check the condition of
the O-ring, and renew it if necessary. Lift the
driveshaft out and check both gears for wear,
renewing them if worn or damaged (see
illustration).
5 If the gear on the intermediate shaft is worn,
or the intermediate shaft bearing is worn or
damaged, the intermediate shaft must be
removed. Remove the engine (see Chap-
ter 2B), then remove the timing belt,
crankshaft and intermediate shaft sprockets
(see Section 10) and the engine front cover
(see Section 11). The intermediate shaft can
be slid out the front of the engine. 
M40 engines
6 Remove the timing belt as described in
Section 10.
7 Remove the cylinder head as described in
Section 12.
8 Unscrew the nut and remove the timing belt
tensioner from the front end cover (see
illustration). If necessary, unscrew the stud
from the cylinder block.
9 Unscrew and remove the crankshaft hub
bolt while holding the crankshaft stationary.
The bolt is tightened to a very high torque,
and it will be necessary to prevent the
crankshaft turning. Ideally, a metal bar should
be bolted to the sprocket, or the starter motor
may be removed and the flywheel held using a
wide-bladed screwdriver. Beware of possible
damage to surrounding components if it is
necessary to improvise some method of
immobilising the crankshaft.
10 Remove the sprocket and spacer, noting
that the shoulder on the spacer faces inwards.
11 Unscrew the bolts and remove the
stabilising and guide rollers from the front end
cover (see illustrations).
12 Using a small screwdriver or similar
instrument, remove the key from the groove in
the nose of the crankshaft (see illustration).
13 Pull the spacer ring off the crankshaft (see
illustration).
14 Unscrew the remaining bolts, and remove
the front end cover and oil pump from the
cylinder block. Note the locations of the front
cover bolts, as they are of different sizes. With
the cover removed, extract the rubber O-ring
from the groove in the nose of the crankshaft
(see illustrations).
15 Note the fitted location of the oil seal, then
prise it out of the housing.

14.2  On M10 and M30 engines, remove the
three bolts that hold the driven gear to the
oil pump, and remove the gear


Note: Considering that a malfunctioning oil
pump can easily cause major engine damage,
we recommend that the oil pump should
always be renewed during engine overhaul,
unless it’s in as-new condition.
16 Remove the cover and check the pump
body, gears or rotors and cover for cracks
and wear (especially in the gear or rotor
contact areas).
17 Check the strainer to make sure it is not
clogged or damaged.
18 Lubricate the gears with clean engine oil,
then attach the pump cover to the body and
tighten the bolts evenly and securely.
19 Before refitting the pump - new, rebuilt or
original - on the engine, check it for proper
operation. Fill a clean container to a depth of
one inch with fresh engine oil of the
recommended viscosity.
20 Immerse the oil pump inlet in the oil, and
turn the driveshaft anti-clockwise by hand. As
the shaft is turned, oil should be discharged
from the pump outlet.
M40 engines
21 With the front end cover on the bench,
unscrew the bolts and remove the cover plate
to expose the oil pump rotors (see
illustrations).
22 Identify the rotors for position, then
remove them from the housing (see
illustrations).
23 Clean the housing and the rotors
thoroughly, then refit the rotors, making sure
that they are in their previously-noted
positions. The inner rotor must be fitted with
the guide facing the body.
24 Using feeler blades, measure the
clearance between the oil pump body and the
outer rotor, then check the clearance 
between the outer and inner rotors (see
illustrations).
25 If the clearance is not as given in the
Specifications, the complete oil pump and
front end cover should be renewed. If the
clearance is within tolerance, remove the
rotors, then pour a little engine oil into the
housing. Refit the rotors and turn them to
spread the oil around.

of bolts, and they have different torque
settings.
31 Fit the spacer ring on the front of the
crankshaft.
32 Apply engine oil to the lips of the new oil
seal, then press it into the housing to its
previously-noted position. To ensure the oil
seal enters the housing squarely, use a large
socket and the crankshaft pulley bolt to pull it
into position (see illustration).
33 Refit the key to the groove in the nose of
the crankshaft.
34 Refit the stabilising roller to the front end
cover, and tighten the bolt.
35 Refit the sprocket, spacer and crankshaft

compound on the bolts, and tighten them
gradually, using a criss-cross pattern, to the
torque listed in this Chapter’s Specifications.
6 The remainder of refitting is the reverse of
removal.
16 Crankshaft rear oil seal -
renewal 3
1 Remove the flywheel or driveplate (see
Section 15).
2 Remove the bolts and/or nuts attaching the
seal retainer to the engine block. Be sure to
remove the two bolts (from underneath)
connecting the rear of the sump to the bottom
of the seal retainer (see illustration).
3 Run a sharp, thin knife between the sump
gasket and the seal retainer, cutting the
retainer free from the gasket. Be very careful
not to damage the gasket, and keep it clean
so you can re-use it. 
4 Break the seal retainer-to-block gasket seal
by tapping the retainer with a plastic mallet or
block of wood and hammer. Do not prise
between the retainer and the engine block, as
damage to the gasket sealing surfaces will
result.
5 Using a scraper, remove all traces of old
gasket material from the sealing surfaces of
the retainer and engine block. Gasket removal
solvents are available at car accessory shops,
and may prove helpful. After all gasket
material has been removed, the gasket
surfaces can be degreased by wiping them
with a rag dampened with a suitable solvent.
Caution: Be very careful not to
scratch or gouge the delicate
aluminium surfaces. Also, do not
damage the sump gasket, and
keep it clean. 
6 Support the retainer on two blocks of
wood, and drive out the seal from behind with
a hammer and screwdriver (see illustration).
Be very careful not to damage the seal bore in
the process.
7 Coat the outside diameter and lip of the
new seal with multi-purpose grease, and drive
the seal into the retainer with a hammer and a
block of wood (see illustration).
8 Apply a film of RTV-type gasket sealant to
the surface of the sump gasket that mates with
the seal retainer. Apply extra beads of RTV
sealant to the edges where the gasket meets
the engine block. Note: If the sump gasket is
damaged, instead of fitting a whole new
gasket, you might try trimming the rear portion
of the gasket off at the point where it meets the
engine block, then trim off the rear portion of a
new sump gasket so it’s exactly the same size.
Cover the exposed inside area of the sump
with a rag, then clean all traces of old gasket
material off the area where the gasket was
removed. Attach the new gasket piece to the
sump with contact-cement-type gasket
adhesive, then apply RTV-type sealant as
described at the beginning of this paragraph.
9 Coat both sides of the new retainer gasket
with RTV-type gasket sealant, then attach the
gasket to the seal retainer. Fit the seal retainer
to the rear of the engine, then refit the bolts
and tighten them evenly to the torque listed in
this Chapter’s Specifications. Work from bolt-
to-bolt in a criss-cross pattern to be sure
they’re tightened evenly. Note 1: Tighten the
retainer-to-block bolts first, then tighten the
sump-to-retainer bolts. Note 2: After applying
RTV-type sealant, reassembly must be
completed in about 10 minutes so the RTV
won’t prematurely harden.
10 Refit the flywheel/driveplate (see Sec-
tion 15).
11 Refit the transmission (on vehicles with
manual transmission, see Chapter 7A; on
vehicles with automatic transmission, see
Chapter 7B).
17 Engine mountings - 
check and renewal 1
1 Engine mountings seldom require attention,
but broken or deteriorated mountings should
be renewed immediately, or the added strain
placed on the driveline components may
cause damage or wear.
Check
2 During the check, the engine must be
raised slightly to remove its weight from the
mounts.
3 Raise the vehicle and support it securely on
axle stands, then position a jack under the
engine sump. Place a large block of wood
between the jack head and the sump, then
carefully raise the engine just enough to take
its weight off the mounts.
Warning: DO NOT place any part
of your body under the engine
when it’s supported only by a
jack!

the seal enters the retainer bore squarely


4 Check the mountings to see if the rubber is
cracked (see illustration), hardened or
separated from the metal plates. Sometimes
the rubber will split right down the centre.
5 Check for relative movement between the
mounting plates and the engine or frame (use
a large screwdriver or lever to attempt to
move the mountings). If movement is noted,
lower the engine and tighten the mounting
nuts or bolts (see illustration). Rubber
preservative should be applied to the
mountings, to slow deterioration.
6 On models with the M40 engine, check the
condition of the dampers on each mounting
by disconnecting them and attempting to
compress and expand them (see illustration).
If there is very little resistance to movement,
the dampers should be renewed.
Renewal
7 If the dampers on the M40 engine are to be
renewed, simply unscrew the bolts, then fit
the new dampers and tighten the bolts.
8 To renew the mountings, disconnect the
battery negative cable, then raise the vehicle
and support it securely on axle stands if you
haven’t already done so.
Caution: If the radio in your
vehicle is equipped with an anti-
theft system, make sure you
have the correct activation code
before disconnecting the battery.
Note: If, after connecting the battery, the
wrong language appears on the instrument
panel display, refer to page 0-7 for the
language resetting procedure.
9 Support the engine as described in
paragraph 3.

This is a guide to getting your vehicle through the MOT test.
Obviously it will not be possible to examine the vehicle to the same
standard as the professional MOT tester. However, working through
the following checks will enable you to identify any problem areas
before submitting the vehicle for the test.
Where a testable component is in borderline condition, the tester
has discretion in deciding whether to pass or fail it. The basis of such
discretion is whether the tester would be happy for a close relative or
friend to use the vehicle with the component in that condition. If the
vehicle presented is clean and evidently well cared for, the tester may
be more inclined to pass a borderline component than if the vehicle is
scruffy and apparently neglected.
It has only been possible to summarise the test requirements here,
based on the regulations in force at the time of printing. Test standards
are becoming increasingly stringent, although there are some
exemptions for older vehicles. For full details obtain a copy of the Haynes
publication Pass the MOT! (available from stockists of Haynes manuals).
An assistant will be needed to help carry out some of these checks.
The checks have been sub-divided into four categories, as follows:
Handbrake
M Test the operation of the handbrake.
Excessive travel (too many clicks) indicates
incorrect brake or cable adjustment.
M Check that the handbrake cannot be
released by tapping the lever sideways. Check
the security of the lever mountings.
Footbrake
M Depress the brake pedal and check that it
does not creep down to the floor, indicating a
master cylinder fault. Release the pedal, wait
a few seconds, then depress it again. If the
pedal travels nearly to the floor before firm
resistance is felt, brake adjustment or repair is
necessary. If the pedal feels spongy, there is
air in the hydraulic system which must be
removed by bleeding.
M Check that the brake pedal is secure and in
good condition. Check also for signs of fluid
leaks on the pedal, floor or carpets, which
would indicate failed seals in the brake master
cylinder.
M Check the servo unit (when applicable) by
operating the brake pedal several times, then
keeping the pedal depressed and starting the
engine. As the engine starts, the pedal will
move down slightly. If not, the vacuum hose or
the servo itself may be faulty.
Steering wheel and column 
M Examine the steering wheel for fractures or
looseness of the hub, spokes or rim. 
M Move the steering wheel from side to side
and then up and down. Check that the 
steering wheel is not loose on the column,
indicating wear or a loose retaining nut.
Continue moving the steering wheel as before,
but also turn it slightly from left to right. 
M Check that the steering wheel is not loose
on the column, and that there is no abnormal
movement of the steering wheel, indicating
wear in the column support bearings or 
couplings.
Windscreen and mirrors 
M The windscreen must be free of cracks or
other significant damage within the driver’s
field of view. (Small stone chips are
acceptable.) Rear view mirrors must be
secure, intact, and capable of being adjusted.

Seat belts and seats 
Note: The following checks are applicable to
all seat belts, front and rear.
M Examine the webbing of all the belts
(including rear belts if fitted) for cuts, serious
fraying or deterioration. Fasten and unfasten
each belt to check the buckles. If applicable,
check the retracting mechanism. Check the
security of all seat belt mountings accessible
from inside the vehicle.
M The front seats themselves must be
securely attached and the backrests must
lock in the upright position.
Doors 
M Both front doors must be able to be opened
and closed from outside and inside, and must
latch securely when closed.
Vehicle identification
M Number plates must be in good condition,
secure and legible, with letters and numbers
correctly spaced – spacing at (A) should be
twice that at (B).
M The VIN plate and/or homologation plate
must be legible.
Electrical equipment
M Switch on the ignition and check the 
operation of the horn.
M Check the windscreen washers and wipers,
examining the wiper blades; renew damaged
or perished blades. Also check the operation
of the stop-lights.
M Check the operation of the sidelights and
number plate lights. The lenses and reflectors
must be secure, clean and undamaged. 
M Check the operation and alignment of the
headlights. The headlight reflectors must not
be tarnished and the lenses must be
undamaged.
M Switch on the ignition and check the 
operation of the direction indicators (including
the instrument panel tell-tale) and the hazard
warning lights. Operation of the sidelights and
stop-lights must not affect the indicators - if it
does, the cause is usually a bad earth at the
rear light cluster.
M Check the operation of the rear foglight(s),
including the warning light on the instrument
panel or in the switch.
Footbrake
M Examine the master cylinder, brake pipes
and servo unit for leaks, loose mountings, 
corrosion or other damage.  
M The fluid reservoir must be secure and the
fluid level must be between the upper (A) and
lower (B) markings.
M Inspect both front brake flexible hoses for
cracks or deterioration of the rubber. Turn the
steering from lock to lock, and ensure that the
hoses do not contact the wheel, tyre, or any
part of the steering or suspension mechanism.
With the brake pedal firmly depressed, check
the hoses for bulges or leaks under pressure.
Steering and suspension
M Have your assistant turn the steering wheel
from side to side slightly, up to the point where
the steering gear just begins to transmit this
movement to the roadwheels. Check for
excessive free play between the steering
wheel and the steering gear, indicating wear or
insecurity of the steering column joints, the
column-to-steering gear coupling, or the
steering gear itself.
M Have your assistant turn the steering wheel
more vigorously in each direction, so that the
roadwheels just begin to turn. As this is done,
examine all the steering joints, linkages,
fittings and attachments. Renew any
component that shows signs of wear or 
damage. On vehicles with power steering,
check the security and condition of the 
steering pump, drivebelt and hoses.
M Check that the vehicle is standing level,
and at approximately the correct ride height.
Shock absorbers
M Depress each corner of the vehicle in turn,
then release it. The vehicle should rise and
then settle in its normal position. If the vehicle
continues to rise and fall, the shock absorber
is defective. A shock absorber which has
seized will also cause the vehicle to fail.

MOT Test Checks
Exhaust system
M Start the engine. With your assistant 
holding a rag over the tailpipe, check the
entire system for leaks. Repair or renew
leaking sections.
Jack up the front and rear of the vehicle,
and securely support it on axle stands.
Position the stands clear of the suspension
assemblies. Ensure that the wheels are
clear of the ground and that the steering
can be turned from lock to lock.
Steering mechanism 
M Have your assistant turn the steering from
lock to lock. Check that the steering turns
smoothly, and that no part of the steering
mechanism, including a wheel or tyre, fouls
any brake hose or pipe or any part of the body
structure.
M Examine the steering rack rubber gaiters
for damage or insecurity of the retaining clips.
If power steering is fitted, check for signs of
damage or leakage of the fluid hoses, pipes or
connections. Also check for excessive
stiffness or binding of the steering, a missing
split pin or locking device, or severe corrosion
of the body structure within 30 cm of any
steering component attachment point.
Front and rear suspension and
wheel bearings 
M Starting at the front right-hand side, grasp
the roadwheel at the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock
positions and shake it vigorously. Check for
free play or insecurity at the wheel bearings,
suspension balljoints, or suspension mount-
ings, pivots and attachments.
M Now grasp the wheel at the 12 o’clock and
6 o’clock positions and repeat the previous
inspection. Spin the wheel, and check for
roughness or tightness of the front wheel
bearing.
M If excess free play is suspected at a
component pivot point, this can be confirmed
by using a large screwdriver or similar tool and
levering between the mounting and the
component attachment. This will confirm
whether the wear is in the pivot bush, its
retaining bolt, or in the mounting itself (the bolt
holes can often become elongated).
M Carry out all the above checks at the other
front wheel, and then at both rear wheels.
Springs and shock absorbers 
M Examine the suspension struts (when
applicable) for serious fluid leakage, corrosion,
or damage to the casing. Also check the
security of the mounting points.
M If coil springs are fitted, check that the
spring ends locate in their seats, and that the
spring is not corroded, cracked or broken.
M If leaf springs are fitted, check that all
leaves are intact, that the axle is securely
attached to each spring, and that there is no
deterioration of the spring eye mountings,
bushes, and shackles.
M The same general checks apply to vehicles
fitted with other suspension types, such as
torsion bars, hydraulic displacer units, etc.
Ensure that all mountings and attachments are
secure, that there are no signs of excessive
wear, corrosion or damage, and (on hydraulic
types) that there are no fluid leaks or damaged
pipes.
M Inspect the shock absorbers for signs of
serious fluid leakage. Check for wear of the
mounting bushes or attachments, or damage
to the body of the unit.
Driveshafts
(fwd vehicles only)
M Rotate each front wheel in turn and inspect
the constant velocity joint gaiters for splits or
damage. Also check that each driveshaft is
straight and undamaged.
Braking system 
M If possible without dismantling, check
brake pad wear and disc condition. Ensure
that the friction lining material has not worn
excessively, (A) and that the discs are not
fractured, pitted, scored or   badly worn (B).
M Examine all the rigid brake pipes
underneath the vehicle, and the flexible
hose(s) at the rear. Look for corrosion, chafing
or insecurity of the pipes, and for signs of
bulging under pressure, chafing, splits or
deterioration of the flexible hoses.
M Look for signs of fluid leaks at the brake
calipers or on the brake backplates. Repair or
M Slowly spin each wheel, while your
assistant depresses and releases the

REF•4 MOT Test Checks
M Examine the handbrake mechanism,
checking for frayed or broken cables,
excessive corrosion, or wear or insecurity of
the linkage. Check that the mechanism works
on each relevant wheel, and releases fully,
without binding.
M It is not possible to test brake efficiency
without special equipment, but a road test can
be carried out later to check that the vehicle
pulls up in a straight line.
Fuel and exhaust systems
M Inspect the fuel tank (including the filler
cap), fuel pipes, hoses and unions. All
components must be secure and free from
leaks.
M Examine the exhaust system over its entire
length, checking for any damaged, broken or
missing mountings, security of the retaining
clamps and rust or corrosion.
Wheels and tyres 
M Examine the sidewalls and tread area of
each tyre in turn. Check for cuts, tears, lumps,
bulges, separation of the tread, and exposure
of the ply or cord due to wear or damage.
Check that the tyre bead is correctly seated
on the wheel rim, that the valve is sound and
properly seated, and that the wheel is not
distorted or damaged. 
M Check that the tyres are of the correct size
for the vehicle, that they are of the same size
and type on each axle, and that the pressures
are correct.
M Check the tyre tread depth. The legal
minimum at the time of writing is 1.6 mm over
at least three-quarters of the tread width.
Abnormal tread wear may indicate incorrect
front wheel alignment.
Body corrosion
M Check the condition of the entire vehicle
structure for signs of corrosion in load-bearing
areas. (These include chassis box sections,
side sills, cross-members, pillars, and all
suspension, steering, braking system and
seat belt mountings and anchorages.) Any
corrosion which has seriously reduced the
thickness of a load-bearing area is likely to
cause the vehicle to fail. In this case
professional repairs are likely to be needed.
M Damage or corrosion which causes sharp
or otherwise dangerous edges to be exposed
will also cause the vehicle to fail.
Petrol models
M Have the engine at normal operating
temperature, and make sure that it is in good
tune (ignition system in good order, air filter
element clean, etc).
M Before any measurements are carried out,
raise the engine speed to around 2500 rpm,
and hold it at this speed for 20 seconds. Allow
the engine speed to return to idle, and watch
for smoke emissions from the exhaust
tailpipe. If the idle speed is obviously much
too high, or if dense blue or clearly-visible
black smoke comes from the tailpipe for more
than 5 seconds, the vehicle will fail. As a rule
of thumb, blue smoke signifies oil being burnt
(engine wear) while black smoke signifies
unburnt fuel (dirty air cleaner element, or other
carburettor or fuel system fault).
M An exhaust gas analyser capable of
measuring carbon monoxide (CO) and
hydrocarbons (HC) is now needed. If such an
instrument cannot be hired or borrowed, a
local garage may agree to perform the check
for a small fee.
CO emissions (mixture)
M At the time of writing, the maximum CO
level at idle is 3.5% for vehicles first used after
August 1986 and 4.5% for older vehicles.
From January 1996 a much tighter limit
(around 0.5%) applies to catalyst-equipped
vehicles first used from August 1992. If the
CO level cannot be reduced far enough to
pass the test (and the fuel and ignition
systems are otherwise in good condition) then
the carburettor is badly worn, or there is some
problem in the fuel injection system or
catalytic converter (as applicable).
HC emissions
M With the CO emissions within limits, HC
emissions must be no more than 1200 ppm
(parts per million). If the vehicle fails this test
at idle, it can be re-tested at around 2000 rpm;
if the HC level is then 1200 ppm or less, this
counts as a pass.
M Excessive HC emissions can be caused by
oil being burnt, but they are more likely to be
due to unburnt fuel. 
Diesel models
M The only emission test applicable to Diesel
engines is the measuring of exhaust smoke
density. The test involves accelerating the
engine several times to its maximum
unloaded speed. 
Note: It is of the utmost importance that the
engine timing belt is in good condition before
the test is carried out. 
M Excessive smoke can be caused by a dirty
air cleaner element. Otherwise, professional
advice may be needed to find the cause.

For the owner who does not possess any,
their purchase will prove a considerable
expense, offsetting some of the savings made
by doing-it-yourself. However, provided that
the tools purchased meet the relevant national
safety standards and are of good quality, they
will last for many years and prove an
extremely worthwhile investment.
To help the average owner to decide which
tools are needed to carry out the various tasks
detailed in this manual, we have compiled
three lists of tools under the following
headings: Maintenance and minor repair,
Repair and overhaul, and Special. Newcomers
to practical mechanics should start off with
the Maintenance and minor repair tool kit, and
confine themselves to the simpler jobs around
the vehicle. Then, as confidence and
experience grow, more difficult tasks can be
undertaken, with extra tools being purchased
as, and when, they are needed. In this way, a
Maintenance and minor repair tool kit can be
built up into a Repair and overhaul tool kit over
a considerable period of time, without any
major cash outlays. The experienced do-it-
yourselfer will have a tool kit good enough for
most repair and overhaul procedures, and will
add tools from the Special category when it is
felt that the expense is justified by the amount
of use to which these tools will be put.
Maintenance and minor repair 
tool kit
The tools given in this list should be
considered as a minimum requirement if
routine maintenance, servicing and minor
repair operations are to be undertaken. We
recommend the purchase of combination
spanners (ring one end, open-ended the
other); although more expensive than open-
ended ones, they do give the advantages of
both types of spanner.
M Combination spanners:
Metric - 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 
19, 21, 22, 24 & 26 mm
M Adjustable spanner - 35 mm jaw (approx)
M Transmission drain plug key (Allen type)
M Set of feeler gauges
M Spark plug spanner (with rubber insert)
M Spark plug gap adjustment tool
M Brake bleed nipple spanner
M Screwdrivers:

Cross blade - approx 100 mm long x 
6 mm dia
M Combination pliers
M Hacksaw (junior)
M Tyre pump
M Tyre pressure gauge
M Oil can
M Oil filter removal tool
M Fine emery cloth
M Wire brush (small)
M Funnel (medium size)
Repair and overhaul tool kit
These tools are virtually essential for
anyone undertaking any major repairs to a
motor vehicle, and are additional to those
given in the Maintenance and minor repair list.
Included in this list is a comprehensive set of
sockets. Although these are expensive, they
will be found invaluable as they are so
versatile - particularly if various drives are
included in the set. We recommend the half-
inch square-drive type, as this can be used
with most proprietary torque wrenches. If you
cannot afford a socket set, even bought
piecemeal, then inexpensive tubular box
spanners are a useful alternative.
The tools in this list will occasionally need
to be supplemented by tools from the Special
list:
M Sockets (or box spanners) to cover range in
previous list 
M Reversible ratchet drive (for use with
sockets) (see illustration)
M Extension piece, 250 mm (for use with
sockets)
M Universal joint (for use with sockets)
M Torque wrench (for use with sockets)
M Self-locking grips
M Ball pein hammer
M Soft-faced mallet (plastic/aluminium or
rubber)
M Screwdrivers:
Flat blade - long & sturdy, short (chubby), 
and narrow (electrician’s) types
Cross blade - Long & sturdy, and short
(chubby) types
M Pliers:
Long-nosed
Side cutters (electrician’s)
Circlip (internal and external)
M Cold chisel - 25 mm

M Steel rule/straight-edge
M Allen keys (inc. splined/Torx type) (see
illustrations)
M Selection of files
M Wire brush
M Axle stands
M Jack (strong trolley or hydraulic type)
M Light with extension lead
Special tools
The tools in this list are those which are not
used regularly, are expensive to buy, or which
need to be used in accordance with their
manufacturers’ instructions. Unless relatively
difficult mechanical jobs are undertaken
frequently, it will not be economic to buy
many of these tools. Where this is the case,
you could consider clubbing together with
friends (or joining a motorists’ club) to make a
joint purchase, or borrowing the tools against
a deposit from a local garage or tool hire
specialist. It is worth noting that many of the
larger DIY superstores now carry a large
range of special tools for hire at modest rates.
The following list contains only those tools
and instruments freely available to the public,
and not those special tools produced by the
vehicle manufacturer specifically for its dealer
network. You will find occasional references
to these manufacturers’ special tools in the
text of this manual. Generally, an alternative
method of doing the job without the vehicle
manufacturers’ special tool is given. However,
sometimes there is no alternative to using
them. Where this is the case and the relevant
tool cannot be bought or borrowed, you will
have to entrust the work to a franchised
garage.

anyone undertaking any major repairs to a
motor vehicle, and are additional to those
given in the Maintenance and minor repair list.
Included in this list is a comprehensive set of
sockets. Although these are expensive, they
will be found invaluable as they are so
versatile - particularly if various drives are
included in the set. We recommend the half-
inch square-drive type, as this can be used
with most proprietary torque wrenches. If you
cannot afford a socket set, even bought
piecemeal, then inexpensive tubular box
spanners are a useful alternative.
The tools in this list will occasionally need
to be supplemented by tools from the Special
list:

Special tools
The tools in this list are those which are not
used regularly, are expensive to buy, or which
need to be used in accordance with their
manufacturers’ instructions. Unless relatively
difficult mechanical jobs are undertaken
frequently, it will not be economic to buy
many of these tools. Where this is the case,
you could consider clubbing together with
friends (or joining a motorists’ club) to make a
joint purchase, or borrowing the tools against
a deposit from a local garage or tool hire
specialist. It is worth noting that many of the
larger DIY superstores now carry a large
range of special tools for hire at modest rates.
The following list contains only those tools
and instruments freely available to the public,
and not those special tools produced by the
vehicle manufacturer specifically for its dealer
network. You will find occasional references
to these manufacturers’ special tools in the
text of this manual. Generally, an alternative
method of doing the job without the vehicle
manufacturers’ special tool is given. However,
sometimes there is no alternative to using
them. Where this is the case and the relevant
tool cannot be bought or borrowed, you will
have to entrust the work to a franchised
garage.

Buying tools
For practically all tools, a tool factor is the
best source, since he will have a very
comprehensive range compared with the
average garage or accessory shop. Having
said that, accessory shops often offer
excellent quality tools at discount prices, so it
pays to shop around.
Remember, you don’t have to buy the most
expensive items on the shelf, but it is always
advisable to steer clear of the very cheap
tools. There are plenty of good tools around at
reasonable prices, but always aim to
purchase items which meet the relevant
national safety standards. If in doubt, ask the
proprietor or manager of the shop for advice
before making a purchase.
Care and maintenance of tools
Having purchased a reasonable tool kit, it is
necessary to keep the tools in a clean and
serviceable condition. After use, always wipe
off any dirt, grease and metal particles using a
clean, dry cloth, before putting the tools away.
Never leave them lying around after they have
been used. A simple tool rack on the garage
or workshop wall for items such as
screwdrivers and pliers is a good idea. Store
all normal spanners and sockets in a metal
box. Any measuring instruments, gauges,
meters, etc, must be carefully stored where
they cannot be damaged or become rusty.
Take a little care when tools are used.
Hammer heads inevitably become marked,
and screwdrivers lose the keen edge on their
blades from time to time. A little timely
attention with emery cloth or a file will soon
restore items like this to a good serviceable
finish.
Working facilities
Not to be forgotten when discussing tools
is the workshop itself. If anything more than
routine maintenance is to be carried out,
some form of suitable working area becomes
essential.
It is appreciated that many an owner-
mechanic is forced by circumstances to
remove an engine or similar item without the
benefit of a garage or workshop. Having done
this, any repairs should always be done under
the cover of a roof.
Wherever possible, any dismantling should
be done on a clean, flat workbench or table at
a suitable working height.
Any workbench needs a vice; one with a
jaw opening of 100 mm is suitable for most
jobs. As mentioned previously, some clean
dry storage space is also required for tools, as
well as for any lubricants, cleaning fluids,
touch-up paints and so on, which become
necessary.
Another item which may be required, and
which has a much more general usage, is an
electric drill with a chuck capacity of at least 8
mm. This, together with a good range of twist
drills, is virtually essential for fitting
accessories.
Last, but not least, always keep a supply of
old newspapers and clean, lint-free rags
available, and try to keep any working area as
clean as possible.

Whenever servicing, repair or overhaul work
is carried out on the car or its components,
observe the following procedures and
instructions. This will assist in carrying out the
operation efficiently and to a professional
standard of workmanship.
Joint mating faces and gaskets
When separating components at their
mating faces, never insert screwdrivers or
similar implements into the joint between the
faces in order to prise them apart. This can
cause severe damage which results in oil
leaks, coolant leaks, etc upon reassembly.
Separation is usually achieved by tapping
along the joint with a soft-faced hammer in
order to break the seal. However, note that
this method may not be suitable where
dowels are used for component location.
Where a gasket is used between the mating
faces of two components, a new one must be
fitted on reassembly; fit it dry unless otherwise
stated in the repair procedure. Make sure that
the mating faces are clean and dry, with all
traces of old gasket removed. When cleaning a
joint face, use a tool which is unlikely to score
or damage the face, and remove any burrs or
nicks with an oilstone or fine file.
Make sure that tapped holes are cleaned
with a pipe cleaner, and keep them free of
jointing compound, if this is being used,
unless specifically instructed otherwise.
Ensure that all orifices, channels or pipes
are clear, and blow through them, preferably
using compressed air.
Oil seals
Oil seals can be removed by levering them
out with a wide flat-bladed screwdriver or
similar implement. Alternatively, a number of
self-tapping screws may be screwed into the
seal, and these used as a purchase for pliers or
some similar device in order to pull the seal free.
Whenever an oil seal is removed from its
working location, either individually or as part
of an assembly, it should be renewed.
The very fine sealing lip of the seal is easily
damaged, and will not seal if the surface it
contacts is not completely clean and free from
scratches, nicks or grooves. If the original
sealing surface of the component cannot be
restored, and the manufacturer has not made
provision for slight relocation of the seal
relative to the sealing surface, the component
should be renewed.
Protect the lips of the seal from any surface
which may damage them in the course of
fitting. Use tape or a conical sleeve where
possible. Lubricate the seal lips with oil before
fitting and, on dual-lipped seals, fill the space
between the lips with grease.
Unless otherwise stated, oil seals must be
fitted with their sealing lips toward the
lubricant to be sealed.
Use a tubular drift or block of wood of the
appropriate size to install the seal and, if the
seal housing is shouldered, drive the seal
down to the shoulder. If the seal housing is
unshouldered, the seal should be fitted with
its face flush with the housing top face (unless
otherwise instructed).
Screw threads and fastenings
Seized nuts, bolts and screws are quite a
common occurrence where corrosion has set
in, and the use of penetrating oil or releasing
fluid will often overcome this problem if the
offending item is soaked for a while before
attempting to release it. The use of an impact
driver may also provide a means of releasing
such stubborn fastening devices, when used
in conjunction with the appropriate
screwdriver bit or socket. If none of these
methods works, it may be necessary to resort
to the careful application of heat, or the use of
a hacksaw or nut splitter device.
Studs are usually removed by locking two
nuts together on the threaded part, and then
using a spanner on the lower nut to unscrew
the stud. Studs or bolts which have broken off
below the surface of the component in which
they are mounted can sometimes be removed
using a stud extractor. Always ensure that a
blind tapped hole is completely free from oil,
grease, water or other fluid before installing
the bolt or stud. Failure to do this could cause
the housing to crack due to the hydraulic
action of the bolt or stud as it is screwed in.
When tightening a castellated nut to accept
a split pin, tighten the nut to the specified
torque, where applicable, and then tighten
further to the next split pin hole. Never slacken
the nut to align the split pin hole, unless stated
in the repair procedure.
When checking or retightening a nut or bolt
to a specified torque setting, slacken the nut
or bolt by a quarter of a turn, and then
retighten to the specified setting. However,
this should not be attempted where angular
tightening has been used.
For some screw fastenings, notably
cylinder head bolts or nuts, torque wrench
settings are no longer specified for the latter
stages of tightening, “angle-tightening” being
called up instead. Typically, a fairly low torque
wrench setting will be applied to the
bolts/nuts in the correct sequence, followed
by one or more stages of tightening through
specified angles.
Locknuts, locktabs and washers
Any fastening which will rotate against a
component or housing during tightening
should always have a washer between it and
the relevant component or housing.
Spring or split washers should always be
renewed when they are used to lock a critical
component such as a big-end bearing
retaining bolt or nut. Locktabs which are
folded over to retain a nut or bolt should
always be renewed.
Self-locking nuts can be re-used in non-
critical areas, providing resistance can be felt
when the locking portion passes over the bolt
or stud thread. However, it should be noted
that self-locking stiffnuts tend to lose their
effectiveness after long periods of use, and
should then be renewed as a matter of course.
Split pins must always be replaced with
new ones of the correct size for the hole.
When thread-locking compound is found
on the threads of a fastener which is to be re-
used, it should be cleaned off with a wire
brush and solvent, and fresh compound
applied on reassembly.
Special tools
Some repair procedures in this manual
entail the use of special tools such as a press,
two or three-legged pullers, spring com-
pressors, etc. Wherever possible, suitable
readily-available alternatives to the manu-
facturer’s special tools are described, and are
shown in use. In some instances, where no
alternative is possible, it has been necessary
to resort to the use of a manufacturer’s tool,
and this has been done for reasons of safety
as well as the efficient completion of the repair
operation. Unless you are highly-skilled and
have a thorough understanding of the
procedures described, never attempt to
bypass the use of any special tool when the
procedure described specifies its use. Not
only is there a very great risk of personal
injury, but expensive damage could be
caused to the components involved.
Environmental considerations
When disposing of used engine oil, brake
fluid, antifreeze, etc, give due consideration to
any detrimental environmental effects. Do not,
for instance, pour any of the above liquids
down drains into the general sewage system,
or onto the ground to soak away. Many local
council refuse tips provide a facility for waste
oil disposal, as do some garages. If none of
these facilities are available, consult your local
Environmental Health Department, or the
National Rivers Authority, for further advice.
With the universal tightening-up of legis-
lation regarding the emission of environmen-
tally-harmful substances from motor vehicles,
most vehicles have tamperproof devices fitted
to the main adjustment points of the fuel
system. These devices are primarily designed
to prevent unqualified persons from adjusting
the fuel/air mixture, with the chance of a
consequent increase in toxic emissions. If
such devices are found during servicing or
overhaul, they should, wherever possible, be
renewed or refitted in accordance with the
manufacturer’s requirements or current
legislation.
Note: It is
antisocial and
illegal to dump
oil down the
drain. To find
the location of
your local oil
bank, call this
number free.

Note: Due to the complexity of the automatic transmission, it is
difficult for the home mechanic to properly diagnose and service this
unit. For problems other than the following, the vehicle should be
taken to a dealer or transmission specialist.
Fluid leakage
mm Automatic transmission fluid is a deep red colour. Fluid leaks
should not be confused with engine oil, which can easily be blown
by airflow onto the transmission.
mm To pinpoint a leak, first remove all built-up dirt and grime from the
transmission housing with degreasing agents and/or by steam-
cleaning. Then drive the vehicle at low speed, so airflow will not
blow the leak far from its source. Raise the vehicle and determine
where the leak is coming from. Common areas of leakage are:
a) Transmission sump (Chapters 1 and 7B)
b) Filler pipe (Chapter 7B)
c) Transmission fluid cooler lines (Chapter 7B)
d) Speedometer sensor (Chapter 7B)
Transmission fluid brown, or has a burned smell
mm Transmission fluid burned; fluid should be changed. May indicate
transmission internal fault (Chapters 1 and 7B).
Transmission will not kickdown with accelerator
pedal pressed to the floor
mm Kickdown cable out of adjustment (Chapter 7B).
General shift mechanism problems
mm Chapter 7B deals with checking and adjusting the shift linkage on
automatic transmissions. Common problems which may be
attributed to poorly-adjusted linkage are:
a) Engine starting in gears other than Park or Neutral.
b) Indicator on selector lever pointing to a gear other than the one
actually being used.
c) Vehicle moves when in Park.
mm Refer to Chapter 7B for the shift linkage adjustment procedure.
Engine will start in gears other than Park or Neutral
mm Inhibitor switch malfunctioning (Chapter 7B).
Transmission slips, shifts roughly, is noisy, or has
no drive in forward or reverse gears
mm There are many probable causes for the above problems, but the
home mechanic should be concerned with only one possibility -
fluid level. Before taking the vehicle to an automatic transmission
specialist, check the level and condition of the fluid as described in
Chapter 1. Correct the fluid level as necessary, or change the fluid
if needed. If the problem persists, have a professional diagnose the
probable cause.

REF•18 Automotive chemicals and lubricants
A number of automotive chemicals and
lubricants are available for use during vehicle
maintenance and repair. They include a wide
variety of products ranging from cleaning
solvents and degreasers to lubricants and
protective sprays for rubber, plastic and 
vinyl.
Cleaners
Carburettor cleaner and choke cleaner
is a strong solvent for gum, varnish and
carbon. Most carburettor cleaners leave a
dry-type lubricant film which will not harden or
gum up. Because of this film, it is not
recommended for use on electrical
components.
Brake system cleaner is used to remove
grease and brake fluid from the brake system,
where clean surfaces are absolutely
necessary. It leaves no residue, and often
eliminates brake squeal caused by
contaminants.
Electrical cleaner removes oxidation,
corrosion and carbon deposits from electrical
contacts, restoring full current flow. It can also
be used to clean spark plugs, carburettor jets,
voltage regulators and other parts where an
oil-free surface is desired.
Moisture dispersants remove water and
moisture from electrical components such as
alternators, voltage regulators, electrical
connectors and fuse blocks. They are non-
conductive and non-corrosive.
Degreasers are heavy-duty solvents used
to remove grease from the outside of the
engine and from chassis components. They
can be sprayed or brushed on, and are usually
rinsed off with water.
Lubricants
Engine oil is the lubricant formulated for
use in engines. It normally contains a wide
variety of additives to prevent corrosion and
reduce foaming and wear. Engine oil comes in
various weights (viscosity ratings) from 5 to
60. The recommended weight of the oil
depends on the season, temperature and the
demands on the engine. Light oil is used in
cold climates and under light load conditions.
Heavy oil is used in hot climates, and where
high loads are encountered. Multi-viscosity
(multigrade) oils are designed to have
characteristics of both light and heavy oils,
and are available in a number of weights from
5W-20 to 20W-50.
Gear oil is designed to be used in
differentials, manual transmissions and other
areas where high-temperature lubrication is
required.
Chassis and wheel bearing grease is a
heavy grease used where increased loads and
friction are encountered, such as for wheel
bearings, balljoints, tie-rod ends and universal
joints.
High-temperature wheel bearing grease
is designed to withstand the extreme
temperatures encountered by wheel bearings
in disc brake-equipped vehicles. It usually
contains molybdenum disulphide (moly),
which is a dry-type lubricant.
White grease is a heavy grease for metal-
to-metal applications where water is a
problem. White grease stays soft at both low
and high temperatures, and will not wash off
or dilute in the presence of water.
Assembly lube is a special extreme-
pressure lubricant, usually containing moly,
used to lubricate high-load parts (such as
main and rod bearings and cam lobes) for
initial start-up of a new engine. The assembly
lube lubricates the parts without being
squeezed out or washed away until the engine
oiling system begins to function.
Silicone lubricants are used to protect
rubber, plastic, vinyl and nylon parts.
Graphite lubricants are used where oils
cannot be used due to contamination
problems, such as in locks. The dry graphite
will lubricate metal parts while remaining
uncontaminated by dirt, water, oil or acids. It
is electrically conductive, and will not foul
electrical contacts in locks such as the
ignition switch.
Penetrating oils loosen and lubricate
frozen, rusted and corroded fasteners and
prevent future rusting or freezing.
Heat-sink grease is a special electrically
non-conductive grease that is used for
mounting electronic ignition modules where it
is essential that heat is transferred away from
the module.
Sealants
RTV sealant is one of the most widely-
used gasket compounds. Made from silicone,
RTV is air-curing; it seals, bonds, waterproofs,
fills surface irregularities, remains flexible,
doesn’t shrink, is relatively easy to remove,
and is used as a supplementary sealer with
almost all low- and medium-temperature
gaskets.
Anaerobic sealant is much like RTV in that
it can be used either to seal gaskets or to form
gaskets by itself. It remains flexible, is solvent-
resistant, and fills surface imperfections. The
difference between an anaerobic sealant and
an RTV-type sealant is in the curing. RTV
cures when exposed to air, while an anaerobic
sealant cures only in the absence of air. This
means that an anaerobic sealant cures only
after the assembly of parts, sealing them
together.
Thread and pipe sealant is used for
sealing hydraulic and pneumatic fittings and
vacuum lines. It is usually made from a Teflon
compound, and comes in a spray, a paint-on
liquid and as a wrap-around tape.
Chemicals
Anti-seize compound prevents seizing,
chafing, cold welding, rust and corrosion in
fasteners. High-temperature anti-seize,
usually made with copper and graphite
lubricants, is used for exhaust system and
exhaust manifold bolts.
Anaerobic locking compounds are used
to keep fasteners from vibrating or working
loose, and cure only after installation, in the
absence of air. Medium-strength locking
compound is used for small nuts, bolts and
screws that may be removed later. High-
strength locking compound is for large nuts,
bolts and studs which aren’t removed on a
regular basis.
Oil additives range from viscosity index
improvers to chemical treatments that claim
to reduce internal engine friction. It should be
noted that most oil manufacturers caution
against using additives with their oils.
Fuel additives perform several functions,
depending on their chemical make-up. They
usually contain solvents that help dissolve
gum and varnish that build up on carburettor,
fuel injection and intake parts. They also serve
to break down carbon deposits that form on
the inside surfaces of the combustion
chambers. Some additives contain upper
cylinder lubricants for valves and piston rings,
and others contain chemicals to remove
condensation from the fuel tank.
Miscellaneous
Brake fluid is specially-formulated
hydraulic fluid that can withstand the heat and
pressure encountered in brake systems. It is
poisonous and inflammable. Care must be
taken so this fluid does not come in contact
with painted surfaces or plastics. An opened
container should always be resealed, to
prevent contamination by water or dirt. Brake
fluid absorbs moisture from the air, if left in an
unsealed container.
Weatherstrip adhesive is used to bond
weatherstripping around doors, windows and
boot lids. It is sometimes used to attach trim
pieces.
Underseal is a petroleum-based, tar-like
substance that is designed to protect metal
surfaces on the underside of the vehicle from
corrosion. It also acts as a sound-deadening
agent by insulating the bottom of the vehicle.
Waxes and polishes are used to help
protect painted and plated surfaces from the
weather. Different types of paint may require
the use of different types of wax and polish.
Some polishes utilise a chemical or abrasive
cleaner to help remove the top layer of
oxidised (dull) paint on older vehicles. In
recent years, many non-wax polishes
containing a wide variety of chemicals such as
polymers and silicones have been introduced.
These non-wax polishes are usually easier to
apply, and last longer than conventional
waxes and polishes.


Buying spare parts & vehicle identification numbers
Buying spare parts
Spare parts are available from many
sources; for example, BMW garages, other
garages and accessory shops, and motor
factors. Our advice regarding spare part
sources is as follows.
Officially-appointed BMW garages - This is
the best source for parts which are peculiar to
your vehicle, and which are not generally
available (eg complete cylinder heads, internal
transmission components, badges, interior
trim etc). It is also the only place at which you
should buy parts if the vehicle is still under
warranty. To be sure of obtaining the correct
parts, it will be necessary to give the storeman
the full Vehicle Identification Number, and if
possible, to take the old parts along for
positive identification. Many parts are
available under a factory exchange scheme -
any parts returned should always be clean. It
obviously makes good sense to go straight to
the specialists on your vehicle for this type of
part, as they are best equipped to supply you.
Other garages and accessory shops - These
are often very good places to buy materials
and components needed for the maintenance
of your vehicle (eg oil filters, spark plugs,
bulbs, drivebelts, oils and greases, touch-up
paint, filler paste, etc). They also sell general
accessories, usually have convenient opening
hours, charge lower prices, and can often be
found not far from home.
Motor factors - Good factors will stock all
the more important components which wear
out comparatively quickly (eg exhaust
systems, brake pads, seals and hydraulic
parts, clutch components, bearing shells,
pistons, valves etc). Motor factors will often
provide new or reconditioned components on
a part-exchange basis - this can save a
considerable amount of money.
Vehicle identification
numbers
Modifications are a continuing and
unpublicised process in vehicle manufacture,
quite apart from major model changes. Spare
parts manuals and lists are compiled upon a
numerical basis, the appropriate identification
number or code being essential to correct
identification of the component concerned.
When ordering spare parts, always give as
much information as possible. Quote the
vehicle model, year of manufacture, Vehicle
Identification Number and engine numbers, as
appropriate.
The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is
located on the right-hand front wheel arch
next to the front suspension strut upper
mounting, on the driver’s door, and on a plate
on top of the facia, just inside the windscreen
(see illustrations).
The engine number is stamped on a
machined face on the left-hand side of the
cylinder block, near the base of the oil level
dipstick tube.
The body number is located on the seam
between the left-hand front wing and inner
The VIN (arrowed) is stamped on the
The VIN is also present on the edge of the
driver’s door


ABS (Anti-lock brake system) A system,
usually electronically controlled, that senses
incipient wheel lockup during braking and
relieves hydraulic pressure at wheels that are
about to skid.
Air bag  An inflatable bag hidden in the
steering wheel (driver’s side) or the dash or
glovebox (passenger side). In a head-on
collision, the bags inflate, preventing the
driver and front passenger from being thrown
forward into the steering wheel or windscreen.
Air cleaner A metal or plastic housing,
containing a filter element, which removes
dust and dirt from the air being drawn into the
engine.
Air filter element The actual filter in an air
cleaner system, usually manufactured from
pleated paper and requiring renewal at regular
intervals.
Allen key A hexagonal wrench which fits into
a recessed hexagonal hole.
Alligator clip A long-nosed spring-loaded
metal clip with meshing teeth. Used to make
temporary electrical connections.
Alternator A component in the electrical
system which converts mechanical energy
from a drivebelt into electrical energy to
charge the battery and to operate the starting
system, ignition system and electrical
accessories. 
Ampere (amp) A unit of measurement for the
flow of electric current. One amp is the
amount of current produced by one volt
acting through a resistance of one ohm.
Anaerobic sealer A substance used to
prevent bolts and screws from loosening.
Anaerobic means that it does not require
oxygen for activation. The Loctite brand is
widely used.
Antifreeze A substance (usually ethylene
glycol) mixed with water, and added to a
vehicle’s cooling system, to prevent freezing
of the coolant in winter. Antifreeze also
contains chemicals to inhibit corrosion and
the formation of rust and other deposits that
would tend to clog the radiator and coolant
passages and reduce cooling efficiency.
Anti-seize compound A coating that
reduces the risk of seizing on fasteners that
are subjected to high temperatures, such as
exhaust manifold bolts and nuts.
Asbestos A natural fibrous mineral with great
heat resistance, commonly used in the
composition of brake friction materials.
Asbestos is a health hazard and the dust
created by brake systems should never be
inhaled or ingested.
Axle A shaft on which a wheel revolves, or
which revolves with a wheel. Also, a solid
beam that connects the two wheels at one
end of the vehicle. An axle which also
transmits power to the wheels is known as a
live axle.
Axleshaft A single rotating shaft, on either
side of the differential, which delivers power
from the final drive assembly to the drive
wheels. Also called a driveshaft or a halfshaft.
B
Ball bearing An anti-friction bearing
consisting of a hardened inner and outer race
with hardened steel balls between two races.
Bearing The curved surface on a shaft or in a
bore, or the part assembled into either, that
permits relative motion between them with
minimum wear and friction.
Big-end bearing The bearing in the end of
the connecting rod that’s attached to the
crankshaft.
Bleed nipple A valve on a brake wheel
cylinder, caliper or other hydraulic component
that is opened to purge the hydraulic system
of air. Also called a bleed screw.
Brake bleeding Procedure for removing air
from lines of a hydraulic brake system.
Brake disc The component of a disc brake
that rotates with the wheels.
Brake drum The component of a drum brake
that rotates with the wheels.
Brake linings The friction material which
contacts the brake disc or drum to retard the
vehicle’s speed. The linings are bonded or
riveted to the brake pads or shoes.
Brake pads The replaceable friction pads
that pinch the brake disc when the brakes are
applied. Brake pads consist of a friction
material bonded or riveted to a rigid backing
plate.
Brake shoe The crescent-shaped carrier to
which the brake linings are mounted and
which forces the lining against the rotating
drum during braking.
Braking systems For more information on
braking systems, consult the Haynes
Automotive Brake Manual.
Breaker bar A long socket wrench handle
providing greater leverage.
Bulkhead The insulated partition between
the engine and the passenger compartment.
C
Caliper The non-rotating part of a disc-brake
assembly that straddles the disc and carries
the brake pads. The caliper also contains the
hydraulic components that cause the pads to
pinch the disc when the brakes are applied. A
caliper is also a measuring tool that can be set
to measure inside or outside dimensions of an
object.

Almost every car you’ve ever loved, loathed or desired is gathered under one roof at the Haynes Motor
Museum. Over 300 immaculately presented cars and motorbikes represent every aspect of our motoring
heritage, from elegant reminders of bygone days, such as the superb Model J Duesenberg to curiosities like
the bug-eyed BMW Isetta.  There are also many old friends and flames. Perhaps you remember the 1959 Ford
Popular that you did your courting in? The magnificent ‘Red Collection’ is a spectacle of classic sports cars
including AC, Alfa Romeo, Austin Healey, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, MG, Riley, Porsche and Triumph.
A Perfect  Day Out
Each and every vehicle at the Haynes Motor Museum has played its part in the history and culture of
Motoring. Today, they make a wonderful spectacle and a great day out for all the family.  Bring the kids, bring
Mum and Dad, but above all bring your camera to capture those golden memories for ever. You will also find
an impressive array of motoring memorabilia, a comfortable 70 seat video cinema and one of the most
extensive transport book shops in Britain. The Pit Stop Cafe serves everything from a cup of tea to
wholesome, home-made meals or, if you prefer, you can enjoy the large picnic area nestled in the beautiful
rural surroundings of Somerset.
The Museum is situated on the A359 Yeovil to Frome road at Sparkford, just off the A303 in Somerset.  It is about 40 miles south of Bristol, and 
25 minutes drive from the M5 intersection at Taunton.

0•4 Introduction
The E30 3-Series range first became
available in the UK in March 1983, and
continued in production until April 1991, when
the revised E36 3-Series range (not covered
by this manual) was introduced. Convertible
and Touring (Estate) models were introduced
for 1988, and these models have continued in
E30 form to date.
The E28 5-Series models were introduced
in October 1981, and were superseded in
June 1988 by the revised E34 5-Series range,
Touring versions of which became available
from March 1992. Throughout this manual,
E28 models are also referred to as “old-
shape”, while E34 models are designated
“new-shape”.
The models covered by this manual are
equipped with single overhead cam in-line
four- and six-cylinder engines. Early 316 and
518 models are fitted with carburettors, but all
other models are fitted with fuel injection
systems. Transmissions are a five-speed
manual, or three- or four-speed automatic.
The transmission is mounted to the back of
the engine, and power is transmitted to the
fully-independent rear axle through a two-
piece propeller shaft. The final drive unit is
bolted solidly to a frame crossmember, and
drives the rear wheels through driveshafts
equipped with inner and outer constant
velocity joints.
The front suspension is of MacPherson
strut type, with the coil spring/shock absorber
unit making up the upper suspension link. The
rear suspension is made up of coil spring-
over-shock absorber struts, or coil springs
and conventional shock absorbers,
depending on model.
The brakes are disc type at the front, with
either drums or discs at the rear, depending
on model. Servo assistance is standard on all
models. Some later models are equipped with
an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).
All models are manufactured to fine limits,
and live up to the BMW reputation of quality
workmanship. Although many of the models
covered by this manual appear complex at
first sight, they should present no problems to
the home mechanic.

0•6 Safety First!
Working on your car can be dangerous.
This page shows just some of the potential
risks and hazards, with the aim of creating a
safety-conscious attitude.
Scalding
• Don’t remove the radiator or expansion
tank cap while the engine is hot.
• Engine oil, automatic transmission fluid or
power steering fluid may also be dangerously
hot if the engine has recently been running.
Burning
• Beware of burns from the exhaust system
and from any part of the engine. Brake discs
and drums can also be extremely hot
immediately after use.
Crushing
• When working under or near
a raised vehicle,
always
supplement the
jack with axle
stands, or use
drive-on
ramps.
Never
venture
under a car which
is only supported by a jack.
• Take care if loosening or tightening high-
torque nuts when the vehicle is on stands.
Initial loosening and final tightening should
be done with the wheels on the ground.
Fire
• Fuel is highly flammable; fuel vapour is
explosive. 
• Don’t let fuel spill onto a hot engine. 
• Do not smoke or allow naked lights
(including pilot lights) anywhere near a
vehicle being worked on. Also beware of
creating sparks 
(electrically or by use of tools).
• Fuel vapour is heavier than air, so don’t
work on the fuel system with the vehicle over
an inspection pit.
• Another cause of fire is an electrical
overload or short-circuit. Take care when
repairing or modifying the vehicle wiring.
• Keep a fire extinguisher handy, of a type
suitable for use on fuel and electrical fires.
Electric shock 
• Ignition HT
voltage can be
dangerous,
especially to
people with heart
problems or a
pacemaker. Don’t
work on or near the
ignition system with
the engine running or
the ignition switched on.
• Mains voltage is also dangerous. Make
sure that any mains-operated equipment is
correctly earthed. Mains power points should
be protected by a residual current device
(RCD) circuit breaker.
Fume or gas intoxication 
• Exhaust fumes are
poisonous; they often
contain carbon
monoxide, which is
rapidly fatal if inhaled.
Never run the
engine in a
confined space
such as a garage
with the doors shut.
• Fuel vapour is also
poisonous, as are the vapours from some
cleaning solvents and paint thinners.
Poisonous or irritant substances
• Avoid skin contact with battery acid and
with any fuel, fluid or lubricant, especially
antifreeze, brake hydraulic fluid and Diesel
fuel. Don’t syphon them by mouth. If such a
substance is swallowed or gets into the eyes,
seek medical advice.
• Prolonged contact with used engine oil can
cause skin cancer. Wear gloves or use a
barrier cream if necessary. Change out of oil-
soaked clothes and do not keep oily rags in
your pocket.
• Air conditioning refrigerant forms a
poisonous gas if exposed to a naked flame
(including a cigarette). It can also cause skin
burns on contact.
Asbestos
• Asbestos dust can cause cancer if inhaled
or swallowed. Asbestos may be found in
gaskets and in brake and clutch linings.
When dealing with such components it is
safest to assume that they contain asbestos.
Special hazards
Hydrofluoric acid
• This extremely corrosive acid is formed
when certain types of synthetic rubber, found
in some O-rings, oil seals, fuel hoses etc, are
exposed to temperatures above 4000C. The
rubber changes into a charred or sticky
substance containing the acid. Once formed,
the acid remains dangerous for years. If it
gets onto the skin, it may be necessary to
amputate the limb concerned.
• When dealing with a vehicle which has
suffered a fire, or with components salvaged
from such a vehicle, wear protective gloves
and discard them after use.
The battery
• Batteries contain sulphuric acid, which
attacks clothing, eyes and skin. Take care
when topping-up or carrying the battery.
• The hydrogen gas given off by the battery
is highly explosive. Never cause a spark or
allow a naked light nearby. Be careful when
connecting and disconnecting battery
chargers or jump leads.
Air bags
• Air bags can cause injury if they go off
accidentally. Take care when removing the
steering wheel and/or facia. Special storage
instructions may apply.
Diesel injection equipment
• Diesel injection pumps supply fuel at very
high pressure. Take care when working on
the fuel injectors and fuel pipes.
Warning: Never expose the hands,
face or any other part of the body
to injector spray; the fuel can
penetrate the skin with potentially fatal
results.
Remember...
DO
• Do use eye protection when using power
tools, and when working under the vehicle.
• Do wear gloves or use barrier cream to
protect your hands when necessary.
• Do get someone to check periodically
that all is well when working alone on the
vehicle.
• Do keep loose clothing and long hair well
out of the way of moving mechanical parts.
• Do remove rings, wristwatch etc, before
working on the vehicle – especially the
electrical system.
• Do ensure that any lifting or jacking
equipment has a safe working load rating
adequate for the job.
A few tips
DON’T
• Don’t attempt to lift a heavy component
which may be beyond your capability – get
assistance.
• Don’t rush to finish a job, or take
unverified short cuts.
• Don’t use ill-fitting tools which may slip
and cause injury.
• Don’t leave tools or parts lying around
where someone can trip over them. Mop
up oil and fuel spills at once.
• Don’t allow children or pets to play in or
near a vehicle being worked on.


0•7Anti-theft audio system
Anti-theft audio system
General information
Some models are equipped with an audio
system having an anti-theft feature that will
render the stereo inoperative if stolen. If the
power source to the stereo is cut, the stereo
won’t work even if the power source is
immediately re-connected. If your vehicle is
equipped with this anti-theft system, do not
disconnect the battery or remove the stereo
unless you have the individual code number
for the stereo.
Refer to the owner’s handbook supplied
with the vehicle for more complete
information on this audio system and its anti-
theft feature.
Unlocking procedure
1 Turn on the radio. The word “CODE” should
appear on the display.
2 Using the station preset selector buttons,
enter the five-digit code. If you make a
mistake when entering the code, continue
the five-digit sequence anyway. If you hear
a “beep,” however, stop immediately and
start the sequence over again. Note: You
have three attempts to enter the correct
code. If the correct code isn’t entered in
three tries, you’ll have to wait one hour, with
the radio on, before you enter the codes
again.
5 Once the code has been entered correctly,
the word “CODE” should disappear from the
display, and the radio should play (you’ll have
to tune-in and enter your preset stations,
however).
6 If you have lost your code number, contact
a BMW dealer service department.
Instrument panel language display
On some later models, disconnecting the
battery may cause the instrument panel
display to default to the German language
(this does not usually apply to UK models). If
it is necessary to reset the correct language
after the battery is reconnected, proceed as
follows. With all the doors shut and the
ignition on (engine not running), press the trip
reset button until the panel displays the
desired language. There are eight languages
available. If you wish to bypass a particular
selection, release the reset button and press
again - this will cause the display to advance
to the next language. Once the correct
language has been selected, continue holding
the reset button until the display reads “I.O.
Version 2.0”. Continue holding the button until
it reads “H.P. Version 3.4”, then release the
button.


0•8 Roadside Repairs
Jacking and wheel
The jack supplied with the vehicle should
be used only for raising the vehicle when
changing a tyre or placing axle stands under
the frame. 
Warning: Never crawl under the
vehicle or start the engine when
this jack is being used as the
only means of support.
When changing a wheel, the vehicle should
be on level ground, with the handbrake firmly
applied, and the wheels chocked. Select
reverse gear (manual transmission) or Park
(automatic transmission). Prise off the hub
cap (if equipped) using the tapered end of the
wheel brace. Loosen the wheel bolts half a
turn, leaving them in place until the wheel is
raised off the ground.
Position the head of the jack under the side
of the vehicle, making sure it engages with the
pocket made for this purpose (just behind the
front wheel, or forward of the rear wheel).
Engage the wheel brace handle and turn it
clockwise until the wheel is raised off the
ground. Unscrew the bolts, remove the wheel
and fit the spare.
Refit the wheel bolts and tighten them
finger-tight. Lower the vehicle by turning the
wheel brace anti-clockwise. Remove the jack
and tighten the bolts in a diagonal pattern to
the torque listed in the Chapter 1
Specifications. If a torque wrench is not
available, have the torque checked by a BMW
dealer or tyre fitting specialist as soon as
possible. Refit the hubcap.
Towing
Vehicles with manual transmission can be
towed with all four wheels on the ground, if
necessary. Automatic transmission-equipped
vehicles can only be towed with all four
wheels on the ground providing that the
speed does not exceed 35 mph and the
distance is not over 50 miles, otherwise
transmission damage can result. For
preference, regardless of transmission type,
the vehicle should be towed with the driven
(rear) wheels off the ground.
Proper towing equipment, specifically
designed for the purpose, should be used,
and should be attached to the main structural
members of the vehicle, not to the bumpers or
bumper brackets. Sling-type towing
equipment must not be used on these
vehicles.
Safety is a major consideration while
towing. The handbrake should be released,
and the transmission should be in neutral. The
steering must be unlocked (ignition switch
turned to position “1”). Remember that
power-assisted steering (where fitted) and the
brake servo will not work with the engine
switched off.
Jacking, towing and wheel changing


0•9Roadside Repairs
When jump-starting a car using a
booster battery, observe the following
precautions:
4 Before connecting the booster
battery, make sure that the ignition is
switched off.
4 Ensure that all electrical equipment
(lights, heater, wipers, etc) is
switched off.
4 Make sure that the booster battery is
the same voltage as the discharged
one in the vehicle.
4 If the battery is being jump-started
from the battery in another vehicle,
the two vehcles MUST NOT TOUCH
each other.
4 Make sure that the transmission is in
neutral (or PARK, in the case of
automatic transmission).
Jump starting will get you out
of trouble, but you must correct
whatever made the battery go
flat in the first place. There are 
three possibilities:
1 The battery has been drained by
repeated attempts to start, or by
leaving the lights on.
2 The charging system is not working
properly (alternator drivebelt slack
or broken, alternator wiring fault or
alternator itself faulty).
3 The battery itself is at fault
(electrolyte low, or battery worn out).
Connect one end of the red jump lead to
the positive (+) terminal of the flat
battery
Connect the other end of the red lead to
the positive (+) terminal of the booster
battery.
Connect one end of the black jump lead
to the negative (-) terminal of the

Connect the other end of the black
jump lead to a bolt or bracket on the
engine block, well away from the
battery, on the vehicle to be started.

the reverse order of connection.
Jump starting


0•10 Roadside Repairs
Puddles on the garage floor or drive, or
obvious wetness under the bonnet or 
underneath the car, suggest a leak that needs
investigating. It can sometimes be difficult to
decide where the leak is coming from,
especially if the engine bay is very dirty
already. Leaking oil or fluid can also be blown
rearwards by the passage of air under the car,
giving a false impression of where the
problem lies.
Warning: Most automotive oils
and fluids are poisonous. Wash
them off skin, and change out of
contaminated clothing, without
delay.
Identifying leaks
The smell of a fluid leaking
from the car may provide a
clue to what’s leaking. Some
fluids are distinctively
coloured. It may help to clean the car
carefully and to park it over some clean
paper overnight as an aid to locating the
source of the leak.
Remember that some leaks may only
occur while the engine is running.
Sump oil Gearbox oil
Brake fluid Power steering fluid
Oil from filter
Antifreeze
Engine oil may leak from the drain plug... ...or from the base of the oil filter.
Leaking antifreeze often leaves a crystalline
deposit like this.
Gearbox oil can leak from the seals at the
inboard ends of the driveshafts.
