      "combat power. Yet these factors by themselves do not ensure suc-\n",

      "sessed many or all of these attributes. When we examine closely\n",
      "the differences between victor and vanquished, we draw one con-\n",
      "clusion. Success went to the armies whose leaders, senior and\n",
      "junior, could best focus their efforts—their skills and their\n",
      "resources—toward a decisive end. Their success arose not merely\n",
      "from excellence in techniques, procedures, and material but from\n",
      "their leaders’ abilities to uniquely and effectively combine them.\n",
      "Winning in combat depends upon tactical leaders who can think\n",
      "creatively and act decisively.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book pertains equally to all Marine leaders, whether their\n",
      "duties entail combat service support, combat support, or combat\n",

      "\n",
      "Tactics is “the art and science of winning engagements and bat-\n",

      "tion of different arms and the immediate exploitation of success\n",
      "to defeat the enemy,”3\n",
      " as well as the sustainment of forces during\n",
      "combat. It also “includes the technical application of combat\n",
      "power, which consists of those techniques and procedures for\n",
      "accomplishing specific tasks within a tactical action.”4\n",
      " This\n",
      "description is from Marine Corps doctrine and reflects our\n",
      "approach to tactics. What does it tell us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tactics refers to the concepts and methods we use to accomplish a\n",
      "particular objective in either combat or military operations other\n",
      "than war. In war, tactics is the application of combat power to\n",
      "defeat the enemy in engagements and battles. Combat power is\n",
      "the total destructive force we can bring to bear against the enemy;\n",
      "it is a unique product of a variety of physical, moral, and mental\n",
      "factors.5\n",
      " Tactics results in the actions and counteractions between\n",
      "opposing forces. It includes the use of maneuver, supported by\n",
      "the application and coordination of fires, to gain advantage in\n",
      "order to defeat the enemy. In military operations other than war,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "tactics may be the schemes and methods by which we perform\n",

      "environment for the delivery of food, medicine, or supplies to a\n",
      "nation or people in need.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated in the definition, tactics is a combination of art and sci-\n",
      "ence to gain victory over the enemy. The art of tactics lies in how\n",
      "we creatively form and apply military force in a given situation. It\n",
      "involves the creation, positioning, and maneuver of combat\n",
      "power. When do we flank the enemy, and when do we ambush?\n",
      "When do we attack, and when do we infiltrate? How do we use\n",
      "speed and momentum to achieve a decisive advantage? This cre-\n",
      "ativity is a developed capacity, acquired through education, prac-\n",
      "tice, and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The science of tactics lies in the technical application of combat\n",
      "power. It includes mastering the techniques and procedures that\n",
      "contribute to the development of warfighting skills such as\n",
      "marksmanship, navigation, gunnery, and close air support. The\n",
      "execution of these techniques and procedures must become sec-\n",
      "ond nature for us; this requires intensive and continuous training.\n",
      "Without mastery of basic warfighting skills, artistry and creativity\n",
      "in their application are impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have examined the art and science of tactics, let us\n",
      "look at how we use tactics to complement strategy and cam-\n",
      "paigning. Strategy and campaigning bring our forces to a particu-\n",
      "lar place at a particular time. We use tactics to win in combat. A\n",
      "war typically involves many individual engagements that form a\n",
      "continuous fabric of activity. Sometimes a cluster of engagements\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "flows together to make up a battle that may last for hours, days, or\n",
      "even several weeks. Tactical competence is indispensable to vic-\n",
      "tory in such engagements and battles. Leaders at the operational\n",
      "and strategic levels use tactical victories to bring about success in\n",
      "the campaign and, ultimately, in the war as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "In combat, our objective is victory. Sometimes this involves the\n",
      "complete destruction of the enemy’s forces; at other times achiev-\n",
      "ing victory may be possible by attacking the enemy’s will to\n",
      "fight. The Marine Corps must be equally prepared to win during\n",
      "both situations—those in which the enemy forces must be com-\n",
      "pletely destroyed (as during World War II), and those in which\n",
      "the complete destruction of the enemy’s forces may not be neces-\n",
      "sary or even desirable. As the Commanding General of the 1st\n",
      "Marine Division in Desert Storm, stated, “Our focus was not on\n",
      "destroying everything. Our focus was on the Iraqi mind and get-\n",
      "ting behind [it].”6\n",
      " The 1st Marine Division Commanding General\n",
      "knew that the path to victory did not lie in the total destruction of\n",
      "the Iraqi forces, but in undermining their will to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE ENVIRONMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "The tactical arena is a dynamic, ever-changing environment. The\n",
      "complexity of this environment makes combat chaotic and unpre-\n",
      "dictable. As an example of confusion and chaos on the battlefield,\n",
      "consider the amphibious assault on the island of Tarawa in\n",
      "November 1943.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During the assault, the combination of high casualties, lack of\n",
      "effective communications, and disruption of the 2d and 8th\n",
      "Marine Regiments’ landings on the assault beaches led to a cha-\n",
      "otic and nearly disastrous situation for the 2d Marine Division.\n",
      "Units were decimated under heavy fire. Surviving Marines hud-\n",
      "dled together under a coconut log sea wall in intermingled units\n",
      "without effective communications. Landing craft carrying rein-\n",
      "forcements and supplies could not make it over a coral reef to the\n",
      "landing beaches. Only through daring leadership, initiative, and\n",
      "teamwork were Marines able to get off the beach and annihilate\n",
      "the defending Japanese force.7\n",
      "\n",
      "The violence of combat only increases the level of confusion\n",
      "and chaos. Robert Sherrod, a Time and Life correspondent at\n",
      "Iwo Jima, gave testimony to this chaos in what he called “war at\n",
      "its worst”:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first night on Iwo Jima can only be described as a nightmare\n",
      "in hell. . . . About the beach in the morning lay the dead. They\n",
      "had died with the greatest possible violence. Nowhere in the\n",
      "Pacific have I seen such badly mangled bodies. Many were cut\n",
      "squarely in half. Legs and arms lay fifty feet from any body.8\n",
      "\n",
      "Battle is the collision of opposing forces—animate, interactive,\n",
      "and unpredictable in behavior. Performance varies from week to\n",
      "week, day to day, and even hour to hour as a unit interacts with its\n",
      "environment and the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Military forces are complex systems consisting of individuals and\n",
      "equipment. They interact internally and externally in seemingly\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "chaotic ways. As Clausewitz wrote, “A battalion is made up of\n",
      "individuals, the least important of whom may chance to delay\n",
      "things or . . . make them go wrong.”9\n",
      " As Marines, we believe the\n",
      "actions of single individuals can have great impact in combat\n",
      "and can also make things go right. For example, Sergeant John\n",
      "Basilone as a machine gunner at Guadalcanal contributed “in\n",
      "large measure to the virtual annihilation of a Japanese regi-\n",
      "ment.”10 He steadfastly manned his position in the face of\n",
      "repeated wave-type assaults and was instrumental in breaking\n",
      "the enemy’s ability to press the attack, forcing them to retreat\n",
      "without achieving their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battle is also influenced by a variety of external conditions—\n",
      "directions and missions established by authorities, terrain,\n",
      "weather, attitudes of the civilian populace—that often cannot be\n",
      "foreseen. The outcome of combat can only be anticipated in terms\n",
      "of probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology also affects the tactical environment—but not always\n",
      "as anticipated. Technology may reduce uncertainty, and it also may\n",
      "increase it. The Spartans, organized into phalanxes, attacked in\n",
      "close formation, making it easy to see and control one’s forces.\n",
      "Today, tactical formations are less well-defined as distances\n",
      "between elements have increased, complicating command and\n",
      "control. Increased weapons lethality, communications range, and\n",
      "tactical mobility cause us to disperse forces over greater distances.\n",
      "War is more fluid as a result of technology. While the machine gun\n",
      "bogged down warfare in World War I, tactical innovations like the\n",
      "tank, the airplane, and the aircraft carrier made warfare more rapid\n",
      "and free-flowing in World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Future battle is likely to become even more chaotic. Although\n",
      "combat in Operation Desert Storm was between fairly well-\n",
      "defined forces in a well-defined space, the forces and operating\n",
      "areas in Vietnam, Somalia, and Grenada were far less well-\n",
      "defined. Enemy units were dispersed and often hidden within the\n",
      "civilian population, making them hard to detect and harder to tar-\n",
      "get. They converged at a time and place of their choosing. Future\n",
      "opponents may choose to fight in this manner to offset our over-\n",
      "whelming superiority in firepower.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chaotic environment also brings opportunity. Clausewitz\n",
      "wrote about combat, “No other human activity is so continuously\n",
      ". . . bound up with chance.”11 The challenge is to recognize\n",
      "opportunity when it occurs in the midst of chaos and uncertainty\n",
      "and to seize it to obtain a clear, unambiguous victory. When\n",
      "viewed through time, even the most chaotic of systems may\n",
      "reveal recurring patterns that may then be exploited. The experi-\n",

      "DEVELOPING AN AMBUSH MENTALITY\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most common tactical tool for gaining advantage is\n",
      "the ambush. All Marines are familiar with an ambush as a type of\n",
      "combat patrol.14 In maneuver warfare, ambush takes on a much\n",
      "broader meaning, and the development of the ambush mentality is\n",
      "integral to maneuver warfare tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambush mentality is probably not new to most of us. We\n",
      "may have employed the ambush mentality in sports. In football,\n",
      "the trap block is an ambush. A player pulls an offensive player\n",
      "off the line, leaving a hole. When a defender comes through the\n",
      "hole, another offensive player suddenly blocks the defensive\n",
      "player from the side, usually knocking the defensive player\n",
      "down. The players have blind-sided the defensive player. That is\n",
      "the ambush mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In basketball, setting up a pick is an ambush. As one teammate\n",
      "drives to the basket, another steps into the defender’s path from\n",
      "behind, blocks the path, stops the defense, and momentarily\n",
      "clears the lane to the basket for the other teammate. Again, that is\n",
      "the ambush mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In combat, we move our reinforced squad into position along a\n",
      "well-traveled trail. We position flank security to protect ourselves\n",
      "and give identification and warning of enemy movements down\n",
      "the trail. We position our weapons so as to concentrate our fires\n",
      "into a “kill zone” and to seal off exits, forcing the enemy to remain\n",
      "subject to our fires. The squad waits in position until signaled\n",
      "when they immediately respond with concentrated, sustained fires\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "on enemy forces trapped in the kill zone. The enemy, surprised\n",
      "into inaction, unsure of what to do or where to move, is annihi-\n",
      "lated. Fires are maintained until all the enemy are killed or until\n",
      "signaled to stop. That is the ambush mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambush mentality tries to turn every situation into an ambush.\n",
      "In this broader context, an ambush has several distinct features.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, in an ambush we try to surprise the enemy. Think of a patrol\n",
      "that we ambush. Our enemies are walking through the woods\n",
      "when suddenly, out of nowhere, they are under fire from multiple\n",
      "directions. They are taking heavy casualties. The psychological\n",
      "impact of surprise may paralyze their thoughts and actions, leav-\n",
      "ing them incapable of reacting effectively. To have an ambush\n",
      "mentality means we always try to surprise the enemy, to do the\n",
      "unexpected. Surprise is the rule rather than the exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we want to draw our enemy unknowingly into a trap.\n",
      "This will often involve deception. We make one course of action\n",
      "appear inviting. When the enemy takes that course of action, we\n",
      "are waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, an ambush is invisible. If the ambush is not invisible, it\n",
      "ceases to be an ambush and instead becomes a target for the\n",
      "enemy. Whether we are defending or attacking, the enemy must\n",
      "not detect us until it is too late to react. Surprise often depends\n",
      "upon invisibility. That invisibility may be provided through\n",
      "stealth in movement or in focusing the enemy’s attention else-\n",
      "where to allow our forces to maneuver without detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The reverse slope defense is an example of using invisibility to\n",
      "spring an ambush. The enemy, not knowing we are there, comes\n",
      "over the crest of a hill and is hit by our fires. The enemy’s vehicles\n",
      "are hit on their soft underbellies. Enemy troops are fully exposed to\n",
      "our weapons. Because we are concealed until the last moment, the\n",
      "enemy could not call in artillery fire on our position. The reverse\n",
      "slope not only protects us from the enemy’s direct fire; it protects\n",
      "us from the enemy’s observation and thus the enemy’s indirect fire.\n",
      "That is part of the ambush mentality: Do not let yourself be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, in an ambush we want to shock the enemy. Instead of tak-\n",
      "ing the enemy under fire gradually with a few weapons at long\n",
      "range, we wait until the enemy is within easy range of every\n",
      "weapon. We then open up suddenly, all at once, with everything\n",
      "we have. The enemy is paralyzed by the shock and cannot react.\n",
      "Everything was going fine, and suddenly the enemy is in a\n",
      "firestorm with people falling all around. Often the enemy will\n",
      "panic, making the problem worse by reacting rather than acting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined arms may be used to ambush the enemy. Artillery raids\n",
      "that reach deeper into the enemy’s vital areas than expected can\n",
      "produce that same desired shock effect as a ground-based\n",
      "ambush. The enemy is placed in a dilemma, attempting to move\n",
      "from the effects of artillery and right into an attack by air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in the ambush mentality, we always focus on the enemy.\n",
      "The purpose of an ambush is not to hold a piece of terrain. It is to\n",
      "destroy the enemy. We use terrain to affect the ambush, but ter-\n",
      "rain itself is not what we are fighting for.\n",
      "\n",

      "Gaining Advantage\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ASYMMETRY\n",
      "\n",
      "Fighting asymmetrically means gaining advantage through im-\n",

      "asymmetrically means using dissimilar techniques and capabili-\n",
      "ties to maximize our own strengths while exploiting enemy weak-\n",
      "nesses. Fighting asymmetrically means fighting the enemy on our\n",
      "terms rather than on the enemy’s. By fighting asymmetrically, we\n",
      "do not have to be numerically superior to defeat the enemy. We\n",
      "only have to be able to exploit enemy vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, using tanks to fight enemy tanks, infantry to fight\n",
      "enemy infantry, and air to fight enemy air is symmetrical. Using\n",
      "attack helicopters to fight enemy tanks and close air support\n",
      "against enemy infantry are examples of fighting asymmetrically.\n",
      "In these examples, we gain the advantage of the greater speed and\n",
      "mobility of the aircraft relative to the enemy. Ambushing tanks\n",
      "with attack helicopters in terrain which hampers tank maneuver\n",
      "provides even more effect and generates even more advantage.\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Combat is a test of wills where the object is to win. One way to\n",

      "In the 18th century, the importance of fast transitions (some-\n",

      "\n",
      "A modern example of the importance of fast transitions comes\n",
      "from aerial combat. In the Korean War, American aviators\n",
      "achieved a high kill ratio of about 10:1 over their North Korean\n",
      "and Chinese opponents. At first glance, this is somewhat surpris-\n",
      "ing. The main enemy fighter, the MiG-15, was superior to the\n",
      "American F-86 in a number of key respects. It could climb and\n",
      "accelerate faster, and it had a better sustained turn rate. The F-86,\n",
      "however, was superior to the MiG in two critical, though less\n",
      "obvious, respects. First, because it had high-powered hydraulic\n",
      "controls, the F-86 could shift from one maneuver to another faster\n",
      "than the MiG. Second, because of its bubble canopy, the F-86\n",
      "pilot had better visibility. The F-86’s better field of view provided\n",
      "better situational awareness and also contributed to fast transi-\n",

      "tions more quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "American pilots developed new tactics based on these two advan-\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "between maneuvers gave it a time advantage that the pilot trans-\n",

      "These tactics illustrate the way fast transitions contribute to over-\n",
      "all speed and to a time advantage. The importance of time and\n",

      "Boyd. A former colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Boyd studied a\n",
      "wide variety of historic battles, campaigns, and wars. He noted\n",
      "that where numerically inferior forces had defeated their oppo-\n",
      "nents, they often did so by presenting the other side with a sud-\n",
      "den, unexpected change or a series of changes. The superior\n",
      "forces fell victim because they could not adjust to the changes in\n",
      "a timely manner. Generally, defeat came at relatively small cost to\n",

      "This research led to the Boyd theory, which states that conflict\n",

      "the fray by observing himself/herself, the surroundings, and the\n",
      "enemy. In tactics, this equates to adoption of a hunting instinct:\n",
      "searching; actively looking; hunting for the enemy; and seeing\n",
      "what the enemy is doing or is about to do. It also includes antici-\n",
      "pating the enemy’s next moves—getting inside the enemy’s mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, based upon those observations, the combatant orients to\n",

      "\n",
      "The Boyd theory helps to define the word “maneuver.” It means\n",
      "being consistently faster than our opponent. As our enemy\n",
      "observes and orients on our initial action, we must be observing,\n",
      "orienting, deciding, and acting upon our second action. As we\n",
      "enact our third, fourth, and fifth move, the time gap between our\n",
      "actions and our enemy’s reactions increasingly widens. Our enemy\n",
      "falls behind in a panicked game of catch up trying to respond to\n",
      "our penetration as we attack his/her reserves and his/her command\n",

      "promotes speed; complexity slows things down. Simplicity\n",
      "should be central to our plans, our staffs (large staffs may be one\n",
      "of war’s greatest consumers of time), our command and control,\n",
      "and our own actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, speed is increased through decentralization. Decentral-\n",
      "ization is an important concept in the execution of maneuver war-\n",
      "fare. How do we achieve decentralization, while still retaining\n",
      "control? We use two main tools that provide the required control\n",
      "of the effort and the decentralization of its execution. These tools\n",
      "are mission tactics and commander’s intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mission tactics is the assignment of a mission to a subordinate\n",
      "without specifying how the mission must be accomplished. It is a\n",
      "key tenet of maneuver warfare. In mission tactics, the higher\n",

      "subordinate commander determines the tactics needed to accom-\n",

      "intent. In this way, each leader can act quickly as the situation\n",
      "changes without passing information up the chain of command\n",
      "and waiting for orders to come back down. Speed is greatly\n",
      "increased by this decentralization process. According to John A.\n",
      "English in his work On Infantry, decentralization has been one of\n",
      "the most significant features of modern war. English wrote: “In\n",
      "the confused and often chaotic battlefield environment of today,\n",

      "\n",
      "A third way to become faster is through experience. Experience\n",
      "breeds speed. Experience gives units advantages over other less\n",

      "confidence of the higher commander who through past experi-\n",
      "ences has found that subordinates can exercise initiative based on\n",
      "the assigned mission and the commander’s stated intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good example of lateral communication comes from aviation.\n",
      "In the air, the pilots of a flight of aircraft communicate laterally as\n",
      "a matter of course. A pilot who needs to talk to another does so. A\n",
      "message need not go through the mission commander and then be\n",

      "\n",
      "A fourth way to become faster is by positioning the commander at\n",
      "the point of friction. This position may be with the main effort,\n",
      "with a supporting effort, or in the rear. A commander who is for-\n",
      "ward can instantly influence the battle as the situation develops.\n",
      "For the same reason, a commander may choose a position at a cru-\n",
      "cial crossroad during a night movement, or where a unit is pushing\n",
      "supplies forward, or where a counterattack force in the defense\n",
      "may be sited. The key is to be where we can best influence the\n",
      "actions of our units. As Marines, we believe in leading from the\n",
      "front since that is where most friction points occur, but they may\n",
      "occur elsewhere. We must choose our positions accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout World War II and his entire career, Lieutenant General\n",

      "Finally, it is important not only to be faster, but to maintain that\n",

      "Improvisation is of critical importance to increasing speed. It\n",

      "and a firm understanding of their senior commander’s intent so\n",
      "that they can adjust their own actions in accordance with the\n",

      "FLEXIBLE PLANS\n",
      "\n",
      "We have several techniques to help us develop adaptability. One\n",
      "of these is to make flexible plans. Flexible plans can enhance\n",
      "adaptability by establishing a course of action that provides for\n",
      "multiple options. For example, a blocking position that covers\n",
      "two avenues of approach from the same location instead of only\n",
      "one provides the flexibility to adapt to an enemy coming through\n",
      "either avenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can increase our flexibility by providing branches for current\n",
      "and future operations. Branches are options (e.g., changing dispo-\n",
      "sitions, orientation, strength, movement, or accepting or declining\n",
      "battle) to deal with changing conditions on the battlefield that may\n",
      "affect the plan.4\n",
      "\n",
      "Flexibility can also be increased by providing sequels for current\n",
      "and future operations. Sequels are courses of action to follow prob-\n",
      "able battle or engagement outcomes; victory, defeat, or stalemate.5\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of branches and sequels is that they prepare us for sev-\n",
      "eral different actions. We should keep the number of branches\n",
      "and sequels to a relative few. We should not try to develop so\n",
      "many branches and sequels that we cannot adequately plan, train,\n",
      "or prepare for any of them. The skillful, well-thought-out use of\n",
      "branches and sequels becomes an important means of anticipating\n",
      "future courses of action. This anticipation helps accelerate the\n",
      "decision cycle and therefore increases tempo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Flexible plans avoid unnecessary detail that not only consumes\n",
      "time in their development but has a tendency to restrict subordi-\n",
      "nates’ latitude. Instead, flexible plans lay out what needs to be\n",
      "accomplished but leave the manner of accomplishment to subor-\n",
      "dinates. This allows the subordinates the flexibility to deal with a\n",
      "broader range of circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flexible plans are plans that can be easily changed. Plans that\n",
      "require coordination are said to be “coupled.” If all the parts of a\n",
      "plan are too tightly coupled, the plan is harder to change because\n",
      "changing any one part of the plan means changing all the other\n",
      "parts. Instead, we should try to develop modular, loosely coupled\n",
      "plans. Then if we change or modify any one part of the plan, it\n",
      "does not directly affect all the other parts.6\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, flexible plans should be simple plans. Simple plans are\n",
      "easier to adapt to the rapidly changing, complex, and fluid situa-\n",
      "tions that we experience in combat.\n",
      "\n",
      "DECENTRALIZATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Another excellent way to improve adaptability is to decentralize\n",
      "decisionmaking authority as much as each situation allows. This\n",
      "means that commanders on the scene and closest to the events\n",
      "have the latitude to deal with the situation as required on their\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "own authority—but always in accordance with the higher com-\n",
      "mander’s intent. This decentralization speeds up reaction time:\n",
      "we do not have to wait for information to flow up to a higher\n",
      "commander and orders to flow back down. It increases the\n",
      "responsiveness of the organization, which in turn increases adapt-\n",
      "ability. Decentralizing control through the use of mission orders\n",
      "is one of the tools we use to maximize our ability to adapt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confidence in the abilities of subordinates plays an important part\n",
      "in decentralization. Leaders who have confidence in the capabili-\n",
      "ties of their subordinates will feel more comfortable in granting\n",
      "them greater latitude in accomplishing tasks. It fosters a climate\n",
      "where senior leaders know that their intent will be carried out.\n",
      "This was particularly true for the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines,\n",
      "during Operation Desert Storm. As the battalion began breaching\n",
      "operations for the advance of the 1st Marine Division across the\n",
      "first two Iraqi mine belts, Marines were suddenly overwhelmed\n",
      "with “ ‘hundreds upon hundreds of Iraqis sporting white flags’ ”7\n",
      "who were trying to surrender. The number was so great that it\n",
      "threatened to stop the Marine advance. However, the battalion\n",
      "commander immediately recognized the situation, judged that the\n",

      "tactics. From the study of our warfighting philosophy, we have\n",
      "gained an appreciation for the requirement to be decisive in bat-\n",
      "tle. To accomplish this, we must clearly visualize the battlespace\n",
      "through gained situational awareness, recognize patterns, and\n",
      "make decisions intuitively. We have also discussed ways we can\n",
      "gain the advantage over the enemy and force the enemy to bend\n",
      "to our will. We also explored how to be faster in relation to the\n",
      "enemy, to adapt to changing conditions, to cooperate for success,\n",
      "to exploit success, and to finish the enemy. Finally, we discussed\n",
      "how we can begin to act on these ideas during our training for\n",
      "combat. The ideas presented in this publication have implications\n",
      "far beyond battlefield tactics and the doctrinal way we think\n",
