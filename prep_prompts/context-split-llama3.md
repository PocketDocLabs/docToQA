<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

### Task instructions:

Divide the text into sections as you might to prepare for writing a report.

Details:
- Each section should be a coherent unit of information.
- Sections of 2-3 paragraphs are preferred though some sections may be shorter or longer.
- The sections will later be used to help create answers to questions about the text.
- Single sentence and sub-sentence sections are not allowed.
- The smallest section should be a single paragraph.
- Use XML style tags, <split></split> to indicate the start and end of each section.


### Provided text:

{{text}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Understood I will divide the provided text into easily digestible sections. I will use the <split></split> tags to indicate the start and end of each section.
