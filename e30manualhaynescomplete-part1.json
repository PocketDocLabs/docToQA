        "1 Introduction \nThis Chapter is designed to help the home\nmechanic maintain his or her vehicle with the\ngoals of maximum performance, economy,\nsafety and reliability in mind. Included is a\nmaster maintenance schedule, followed by\nprocedures dealing specifically with each item\non the schedule. Visual checks, adjustments,\ncomponent renewal and other helpful items\nare included. Refer to the accompanying\nillustrations of the engine compartment and\nthe underside of the vehicle for the locations\nof various components. Servicing the vehicle,\nin accordance with the mileage/time\nmaintenance schedule and the step-by-step\nprocedures, will result in a planned\nmaintenance programme that should produce\na long and reliable service life. Keep in mind\nthat it is a comprehensive plan, so maintaining\nsome items but not others at specified\nintervals, will not produce the same results.",
        "2 Routine maintenance\nAs you service the vehicle, you will discover\nthat many of the procedures can - and should\n- be grouped together, because of the nature\nof the particular procedure you're performing,\nor because of the close proximity of two\notherwise-unrelated components to one\nanother. For example, if the vehicle is raised\nfor chassis lubrication, you should inspect the\nexhaust, suspension, steering and fuel\nsystems while you're under the vehicle. When\nthe wheels are removed for other work, it\nmakes good sense to check the brakes, since\nthe wheels are already removed. Finally, let's\nsuppose you have to borrow a torque wrench.\nEven if you only need it to tighten the spark\nplugs, you might as well check the torque of\nas many critical nuts and bolts as time allows. \nThe first step in this maintenance\nprogramme is to prepare yourself before the\nactual work begins. Read through all the\nprocedures you're planning to do, then gather\nup all the parts and tools needed. If it looks\nlike you might run into problems during a\nparticular job, seek advice from a mechanic or\nan experienced do-it-yourselfer.",
        "3 Engine \"tune-up\" - \ngeneral information \nThe term \"tune-up\" is used in this manual to\nrepresent a combination of individual\noperations rather than one specific procedure.\nIf, from the time the vehicle is new, the\nroutine maintenance schedule is followed\nclosely, and frequent checks are made of fluid\nlevels and high-wear items, as suggested\nthroughout this manual, the engine will be\nkept in relatively good running condition, and\nthe need for additional work will be minimised. \nMore likely than not, however, there will be\ntimes when the engine is running poorly due\nto a lack of regular maintenance. This is even\nmore likely if a used vehicle, which has not\nreceived regular and frequent maintenance\nchecks, is purchased. In such cases, an\nengine tune-up will be needed outside of the\nregular maintenance intervals. \nThe first step in any tune-up or diagnostic\nprocedure to help correct a poor-running\nengine is a cylinder compression check. A\ncompression check (see Chapter 2B) will help\ndetermine the condition of internal engine\ncomponents, and should be used as a guide\nfor tune-up and repair procedures. If, for\ninstance, a compression check indicates\nserious internal engine wear, a conventional\ntune-up will not improve the performance of\nthe engine, and would be a waste of time and\nmoney. Because of its importance, the\ncompression check should be done by\nsomeone with the right equipment, and the\nknowledge to use it properly. \nThe following procedures are those most\noften needed to bring a generally poor-\nrunning engine back into a proper state of\ntune. \nMinor tune-up\nCheck all engine-related fluids (Section 4)\nCheck all underbonnet hoses (Section 10)\nCheck and adjust the drivebelts (Sec-\ntion 11)\nClean, inspect and test the battery (Sec-\ntion 13)\nRenew the spark plugs (Section 14)\nInspect the spark plug HT leads, distributor\ncap and rotor (Section 15)\nCheck the air filter (Section 20)\nCheck the cooling system (Section 22)\nMajor tune-up\nAll items listed under minor tune-up, plus . . . \nCheck the ignition system (see Chapter 5)\nCheck the charging system (see Chapter 5)\nCheck the fuel system (see Chapter 4)\nRenew the spark plug HT leads, distributor\ncap and rotor (Section 15)\n1*7",
        "1\nRoutine Maintenance\nWeekly checks\n4 Fluid level checks 1\nNote: The following are fluid level checks to\nbe done on a 250-mile or weekly basis.\nAdditional fluid level checks can be found in\nspecific maintenance procedures which\nfollow. Regardless of intervals, be alert to fluid\nleaks under the vehicle, which would indicate\na fault to be corrected immediately.\n1 Fluids are an essential part of the\nlubrication, cooling, brake and windscreen\nwasher systems. Because the fluids gradually\nbecome depleted and/or contaminated during\nnormal operation of the vehicle, they must be\nperiodically replenished. See \"Lubricants and\nfluids\" at the beginning of this Chapter before\nadding fluid to any of the following\ncomponents. Note: The vehicle must be on\nlevel ground when any fluid levels are\nchecked.",
        "Engine oil\n2 Engine oil is checked with a dipstick, which\nis located on the side of the engine (refer to\nthe underbonnet illustrations in this Chapter\nfor dipstick location). The dipstick extends\nthrough a metal tube down into the sump. \n3 The engine oil should be checked before\nthe vehicle has been driven, or at least \n15 minutes after the engine has been shut off.\n4 Pull the dipstick out of the tube, and wipe\nall of the oil away from the end with a clean\nrag or paper towel. Insert the clean dipstick all\nthe way back into the tube, and pull it out\nagain. Note the oil at the end of the dipstick.\nAt its highest point, the oil should be between\nthe two notches or marks (see illustration). \n5 It takes one litre of oil to raise the level from\nthe lower mark to the upper mark on the\ndipstick. Do not allow the level to drop below\nthe lower mark, or oil starvation may cause\n4.4  The oil level should be kept between\nthe two marks, preferably at or near the\nupper one - if it isn't, add enough oil to\nbring the level to the upper mark\nIf the oil is checked\nimmediately after driving the\nvehicle, some of the oil will\nremain in the upper part of\nthe engine, resulting in an inaccurate\nreading on the dipstick.\nengine damage. Conversely, overfilling the\nengine (adding oil above the upper mark) may\ncause oil-fouled spark plugs, oil leaks, or oil\nseal failures.",
        "6 To add oil, remove the filler cap located on\nthe valve cover (see illustrations). After\nadding oil, wait a few minutes to allow the\nlevel to stabilise, then pull the dipstick out and\ncheck the level again. Add more oil if required.\nRefit the filler cap, tightening it by hand only.",
        "7 Checking the oil level is an important\npreventive maintenance step. A consistently\nlow oil level indicates oil leakage through\ndamaged seals or defective gaskets, or oil\nburning (internal leakage past worn rings or\nvalve guides). The condition of the oil should\nalso be noted. If the oil looks milky in colour or\nhas water droplets in it, the cylinder head\ngasket may be blown, or the head or block\nmay be cracked. The engine should be\nrepaired immediately. Whenever you check\nthe oil level, slide your thumb and index finger\nup the dipstick before wiping off the oil. If you\nsee small dirt or metal particles clinging to the\ndipstick, the oil should be changed (see\nSection 6).",
        "Engine coolant\nWarning: Do not allow antifreeze\nto come in contact with your\nskin, or with the vehicle\npaintwork. Rinse off spills immediately\nwith plenty of water. Antifreeze is highly\ntoxic if ingested. Never leave antifreeze\nlying around in an open container, or in\npuddles on the floor; children and pets are\nattracted by its sweet smell, and may drink\nit. Check with local authorities about\ndisposing of used antifreeze. Local\ncollection centres may exist, to see that\nantifreeze is disposed of safely.",
        "8 All vehicles covered by this manual are\nequipped with a pressurised coolant recovery\nsystem. On most models, a white plastic\nexpansion tank (or coolant reservoir) located\nin the engine compartment is connected by a\nhose to the radiator. As the engine heats up\nduring operation, the expanding coolant fills\nthe tank. As the engine cools, the coolant is\nautomatically drawn back into the cooling\nsystem, to maintain the correct level.",
        "9 The coolant level in the reservoir (see\nillustrations) should be checked regularly.\nAdd a 40%/60% mixture of ethylene glycol-\nbased antifreeze to water (see illustration).\nWarning: Do not remove the\nexpansion tank cap or radiator\ncap to check the coolant level,\nunless the engine is completely\ncold! The level in the reservoir varies with\nthe temperature of the engine. When the\nengine is cold, the coolant level should be\nabove the LOW mark on the reservoir.\nOnce the engine has warmed up, the level\nshould be at or near the FULL mark. If it\nisn't, allow the engine to cool, then remove\nthe cap from the reservoir. \n10 Drive the vehicle and recheck the coolant\nlevel. If only a small amount of coolant is\nrequired to bring the system up to the proper\nlevel, plain water can be used. However,\nrepeated additions of water will dilute the\nantifreeze. In order to maintain the proper\nratio of antifreeze and water, always top-up\nthe coolant level with the correct mixture.\n11 If the coolant level drops consistently,\nthere must be a leak in the system. Inspect\nthe radiator, hoses, filler cap, drain plugs and\nwater pump (see Section 29). If no leaks are\nnoted, have the expansion tank cap or\nradiator cap pressure-tested by a BMW\ndealer.\n12 If you have to remove the cap, wait until\nthe engine has cooled completely, then wrap\na thick cloth around the cap and turn it to the\nfirst stop. If coolant or steam escapes, let the\nengine cool down longer, then remove the\ncap.\n13 Check the condition of the coolant as\nwell. It should be relatively clear. If it's brown\nor rust-coloured, the system should be\ndrained, flushed and refilled. Even if the\ncoolant appears to be normal, the corrosion",

Do\nnot use brake fluid that has been standing\nopen or is more than one year old. Brake\nfluid absorbs moisture from the air, which\ncan cause a dangerous loss of brake\neffectiveness. Use only the specified type\nof brake fluid. Mixing different types (such\nas DOT 3 or 4 and DOT 5) can cause brake\nfailure. \n14 The brake master cylinder is mounted at\nthe left rear corner of the engine\ncompartment. The clutch fluid reservoir\n(manual transmission models) is mounted on\nthe right-hand side.\n15 To check the clutch fluid level, observe\nthe level through the translucent reservoir.\nThe level should be at or near the step\nmoulded into the reservoir. If the level is low,\nremove the reservoir cap to add the specified\nfluid (see illustration).\n16 The brake fluid level is checked by looking\nthrough the plastic reservoir mounted on the\nmaster cylinder (see illustration). The fluid\nlevel should be between the MAX and MIN\nlines on the reservoir. If the fluid level is low,\nfirst wipe the top of the reservoir and the cap\nwith a clean rag, to prevent contamination of\nthe system as the cap is unscrewed. Top-up\nwith the recommended brake fluid, but do not\noverfill. \n17 While the reservoir cap is off, check the\nmaster cylinder reservoir for contamination. If\nrust deposits, dirt particles or water droplets\nare present, the system should be drained\nand refilled.\n18 After filling the reservoir to the proper\nlevel, make sure the cap is seated correctly, to\nprevent fluid leakage and/or contamination. \n19 The fluid level in the master cylinder will\ndrop slightly as the disc brake pads wear.\nThere is no need to top up to compensate for\nthis fall provided that the level stays above the\nMIN line; the level will rise again when new\npads are fitted. A very low level may indicate\nworn brake pads. Check for wear (see Sec-\ntion 26).\n20 If the brake fluid level drops consistently,\ncheck the entire system for leaks immediately.\nExamine all brake lines, hoses and\nconnections, along with the calipers, wheel\ncylinders and master cylinder (see Sec-\ntion 26). \n21 When checking the fluid level, if you\ndiscover one or both reservoirs empty or\nnearly empty, the brake or clutch hydraulic\nsystem should be checked for leaks and bled\n(see Chapters 8 and 9).",
        "Windscreen washer fluid\n22 Fluid for the windscreen washer system is\nstored in a plastic reservoir in the engine\ncompartment (see illustration).\n23 In milder climates, plain water can be\nused in the reservoir, but it should be kept no\nmore than two-thirds full, to allow for\nexpansion if the water freezes. In colder\nclimates, use windscreen washer system\nantifreeze, available at any car accessory\nshop, to lower the freezing point of the fluid.\nThis comes in concentrated or pre-mixed\nform. If you purchase concentrated antifreeze,\nmix the antifreeze with water in accordance\nwith the manufacturer's directions on the\ncontainer.\nCaution: Do not use cooling\nsystem antifreeze - it will damage\nthe vehicle's paint.",
        "5 Tyre and tyre pressure\nchecks 1\n1 Periodic inspection of the tyres may save\nyou the inconvenience of being stranded with\na flat tyre. It can also provide you with vital\ninformation regarding possible problems in\nthe steering and suspension systems before\nmajor damage occurs. \n2 Tyres are equipped with bands that will\nappear when tread depth reaches 1.6 mm, at\nwhich time the tyres can be considered worn\nout. This represents the legal minimum tread\ndepth; most authorities recommend renewing\nany tyre on which the tread depth is 2 mm or\nless. Tread wear can be monitored with a\nsimple, inexpensive device known as a tread\ndepth indicator (see illustration). \n3 Note any abnormal tyre wear (see\nillustration overleaf). Tread pattern irregular-\nities such as cupping, flat spots and more\nwear on one side than the other are\nindications of front end alignment and/or\nwheel balance problems. If any of these\nconditions are noted, take the vehicle to a tyre\nspecialist to correct the problem. \n4 Look closely for cuts, punctures and\nembedded nails or tacks. Sometimes, after a\nnail has embedded itself in the tread, a tyre\nwill hold air pressure for a short time, or may",

Examine the\ntread for an object that may have embedded\nitself in the tyre, or for a previous repair that\nmay have begun to leak. If a puncture is\nsuspected, it can be easily verified by\nspraying a solution of soapy water onto the\npuncture (see illustration). The soapy\nsolution will bubble if there is a leak. Unless\nthe puncture is unusually large, a tyre\nspecialist can usually repair the tyre.\n5 Carefully inspect the inner sidewall of each\ntyre for evidence of brake fluid leakage. If you\nsee any, inspect the brakes immediately.\n6 Correct air pressure adds miles to the life\nspan of the tyres, improves fuel economy, and\nenhances overall ride quality. A tyre pressure\ngauge is essential.\n7 Always check the tyre pressures when the\ntyres are cold (ie before driving the vehicle).\nChecking the pressures when the tyres are\nwarm, or hot, will result in higher readings,\ndue to heat expansion. On no account should\nair be let out of the tyres in this case, or the\ntyres will effectively be under-inflated when\ncold.\n8 Unscrew the valve cap protruding from the\nwheel or hubcap, and push the gauge firmly\nonto the valve stem (see illustration). Note\nthe reading on the gauge, and compare the\nfigure to the recommended tyre pressures\nshown in the Specifications listed at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. Be sure to refit the\nvalve cap to keep dirt and moisture out of the\nvalve stem mechanism. Check all four tyres\nand, if necessary, add enough air to bring\nthem to the recommended pressure. \n9 Don't forget to keep the spare tyre inflated\nto the specified pressure.\n1*10",

Included is a\nmaster maintenance schedule, followed by\nprocedures dealing specifically with each item\non the schedule. Visual checks, adjustments,\ncomponent renewal and other helpful items\nare included. Refer to the accompanying\nillustrations of the engine compartment and\nthe underside of the vehicle for the locations\nof various components. Servicing the vehicle,\nin accordance with the mileage/time\nmaintenance schedule and the step-by-step\nprocedures, will result in a planned\nmaintenance programme that should produce\na long and reliable service life. Keep in mind\nthat it is a comprehensive plan, so maintaining\nsome items but not others at specified\nintervals, will not produce the same results.\n2 Routine maintenance\nAs you service the vehicle, you will discover\nthat many of the procedures can - and should\n- be grouped together, because of the nature\nof the particular procedure you're performing,\nor because of the close proximity of two\notherwise-unrelated components to one\nanother. For example, if the vehicle is raised\nfor chassis lubrication, you should inspect the\nexhaust, suspension, steering and fuel\nsystems while you're under the vehicle. When\nthe wheels are removed for other work, it\nmakes good sense to check the brakes, since\nthe wheels are already removed. Finally, let's\nsuppose you have to borrow a torque wrench.\nEven if you only need it to tighten the spark\nplugs, you might as well check the torque of\nas many critical nuts and bolts as time allows. \nThe first step in this maintenance\nprogramme is to prepare yourself before the\nactual work begins. Read through all the\nprocedures you're planning to do, then gather\nup all the parts and tools needed. If it looks\nlike you might run into problems during a\nparticular job, seek advice from a mechanic or\nan experienced do-it-yourselfer.\n3 Engine \"tune-up\" - \ngeneral information \nThe term \"tune-up\" is used in this manual to\nrepresent a combination of individual\noperations rather than one specific procedure.\nIf, from the time the vehicle is new, the\nroutine maintenance schedule is followed\nclosely, and frequent checks are made of fluid\nlevels and high-wear items, as suggested\nthroughout this manual, the engine will be\nkept in relatively good running condition, and\nthe need for additional work will be minimised. \nMore likely than not, however, there will be\ntimes when the engine is running poorly due\nto a lack of regular maintenance. This is even\nmore likely if a used vehicle, which has not\nreceived regular and frequent maintenance\nchecks, is purchased. In such cases, an\nengine tune-up will be needed outside of the\nregular maintenance intervals. \nThe first step in any tune-up or diagnostic\nprocedure to help correct a poor-running\nengine is a cylinder compression check. A\ncompression check (see Chapter 2B) will help\ndetermine the condition of internal engine\ncomponents, and should be used as a guide\nfor tune-up and repair procedures. If, for\ninstance, a compression check indicates\nserious internal engine wear, a conventional\ntune-up will not improve the performance of\nthe engine, and would be a waste of time and\nmoney. Because of its importance, the\ncompression check should be done by\nsomeone with the right equipment, and the\nknowledge to use it properly. \nThe following procedures are those most\noften needed to bring a generally poor-\nrunning engine back into a proper state of\ntune. \nMinor tune-up\nCheck all engine-related fluids (Section 4)\nCheck all underbonnet hoses (Section 10)\nCheck and adjust the drivebelts (Sec-\ntion 11)\nClean, inspect and test the battery (Sec-\ntion 13)\nRenew the spark plugs (Section 14)\nInspect the spark plug HT leads, distributor\ncap and rotor (Section 15)\nCheck the air filter (Section 20)\nCheck the cooling system (Section 22)\nMajor tune-up\nAll items listed under minor tune-up, plus . . . \nCheck the ignition system (see Chapter 5)\nCheck the charging system (see Chapter 5)\nCheck the fuel system (see Chapter 4)\nRenew the spark plug HT leads, distributor\ncap and rotor (Section 15)\n1*7\n1\nRoutine Maintenance\nWeekly checks\n4 Fluid level checks 1\nNote: The following are fluid level checks to\nbe done on a 250-mile or weekly basis.\nAdditional fluid level checks can be found in\nspecific maintenance procedures which\nfollow. Regardless of intervals, be alert to fluid\nleaks under the vehicle, which would indicate\na fault to be corrected immediately.\n1 Fluids are an essential part of the\nlubrication, cooling, brake and windscreen\nwasher systems. Because the fluids gradually\nbecome depleted and/or contaminated during\nnormal operation of the vehicle, they must be\nperiodically replenished. See \"Lubricants and\nfluids\" at the beginning of this Chapter before\nadding fluid to any of the following\ncomponents. Note: The vehicle must be on\nlevel ground when any fluid levels are\nchecked. \nEngine oil\n2 Engine oil is checked with a dipstick, which\nis located on the side of the engine (refer to\nthe underbonnet illustrations in this Chapter\nfor dipstick location). The dipstick extends\nthrough a metal tube down into the sump. \n3 The engine oil should be checked before\nthe vehicle has been driven, or at least \n15 minutes after the engine has been shut off.\n4 Pull the dipstick out of the tube, and wipe\nall of the oil away from the end with a clean\nrag or paper towel. Insert the clean dipstick all\nthe way back into the tube, and pull it out\nagain. Note the oil at the end of the dipstick.\nAt its highest point, the oil should be between\nthe two notches or marks (see illustration). \n5 It takes one litre of oil to raise the level from\nthe lower mark to the upper mark on the\ndipstick. Do not allow the level to drop below\nthe lower mark, or oil starvation may cause\n4.4  The oil level should be kept between\nthe two marks, preferably at or near the\nupper one - if it isn't, add enough oil to\nbring the level to the upper mark\nIf the oil is checked\nimmediately after driving the\nvehicle, some of the oil will\nremain in the upper part of\nthe engine, resulting in an inaccurate\nreading on the dipstick.\n\n\nengine damage. Conversely, overfilling the\nengine (adding oil above the upper mark) may\ncause oil-fouled spark plugs, oil leaks, or oil\nseal failures. \n6 To add oil, remove the filler cap located on\nthe valve cover (see illustrations). After\nadding oil, wait a few minutes to allow the\nlevel to stabilise, then pull the dipstick out and\ncheck the level again. Add more oil if required.\nRefit the filler cap, tightening it by hand only. \n7 Checking the oil level is an important\npreventive maintenance step. A consistently\nlow oil level indicates oil leakage through\ndamaged seals or defective gaskets, or oil\nburning (internal leakage past worn rings or\nvalve guides). The condition of the oil should\nalso be noted. If the oil looks milky in colour or\nhas water droplets in it, the cylinder head\ngasket may be blown, or the head or block\nmay be cracked. The engine should be\nrepaired immediately. Whenever you check\nthe oil level, slide your thumb and index finger\nup the dipstick before wiping off the oil. If you\nsee small dirt or metal particles clinging to the\ndipstick, the oil should be changed (see\nSection 6).\nEngine coolant\nWarning: Do not allow antifreeze\nto come in contact with your\nskin, or with the vehicle\npaintwork. Rinse off spills immediately\nwith plenty of water. Antifreeze is highly\ntoxic if ingested. Never leave antifreeze\nlying around in an open container, or in\npuddles on the floor; children and pets are\nattracted by its sweet smell, and may drink\nit. Check with local authorities about\ndisposing of used antifreeze. Local\ncollection centres may exist, to see that\nantifreeze is disposed of safely. \n8 All vehicles covered by this manual are\nequipped with a pressurised coolant recovery\nsystem. On most models, a white plastic\nexpansion tank (or coolant reservoir) located\nin the engine compartment is connected by a\nhose to the radiator. As the engine heats up\nduring operation, the expanding coolant fills\nthe tank. As the engine cools, the coolant is\nautomatically drawn back into the cooling\nsystem, to maintain the correct level.\n9 The coolant level in the reservoir (see\nillustrations) should be checked regularly.\nAdd a 40%/60% mixture of ethylene glycol-\nbased antifreeze to water (see illustration).\nWarning: Do not remove the\nexpansion tank cap or radiator\ncap to check the coolant level,\nunless the engine is completely\ncold! The level in the reservoir varies with\nthe temperature of the engine. When the\nengine is cold, the coolant level should be\nabove the LOW mark on the reservoir.\nOnce the engine has warmed up, the level\nshould be at or near the FULL mark. If it\nisn't, allow the engine to cool, then remove\nthe cap from the reservoir. \n10 Drive the vehicle and recheck the coolant\nlevel. If only a small amount of coolant is\nrequired to bring the system up to the proper\nlevel, plain water can be used. However,\nrepeated additions of water will dilute the\nantifreeze. In order to maintain the proper\nratio of antifreeze and water, always top-up\nthe coolant level with the correct mixture.\n11 If the coolant level drops consistently,\nthere must be a leak in the system. Inspect\nthe radiator, hoses, filler cap, drain plugs and\nwater pump (see Section 29). If no leaks are\nnoted, have the expansion tank cap or\nradiator cap pressure-tested by a BMW\ndealer.\n12 If you have to remove the cap, wait until\nthe engine has cooled completely, then wrap\na thick cloth around the cap and turn it to the\nfirst stop. If coolant or steam escapes, let the\nengine cool down longer, then remove the\ncap.\n13 Check the condition of the coolant as\nwell. It should be relatively clear. If it's brown\nor rust-coloured, the system should be\ndrained, flushed and refilled. Even if the\ncoolant appears to be normal, the corrosion\n1*8\n4.9d  Adding antifreeze mixture4.9c  On some 5-Series models, the\nexpansion tank (coolant reservoir) is\nlocated on the bulkhead\n4.9b  On other models, the expansion tank\n(coolant reservoir) is located on the side of\nthe engine compartment - remove the cap\nto add coolant\n4.9a  On some models, the expansion tank\n(coolant reservoir) is mounted on the\nradiator - make sure the level is kept at or\nnear the FULL mark (arrowed)\n4.6b  Topping-up the engine oil4.6a  The threaded oil filler cap is located\nin the valve cover - always make sure the\narea around the opening is clean before\nunscrewing the cap\n\n\ninhibitors wear out, so it must be renewed at\nthe specified intervals.\nBrake and clutch fluid\nWarning: Brake fluid can harm\nyour eyes and damage painted\nsurfaces, so use extreme caution\nwhen handling or pouring it. Do\nnot use brake fluid that has been standing\nopen or is more than one year old. Brake\nfluid absorbs moisture from the air, which\ncan cause a dangerous loss of brake\neffectiveness. Use only the specified type\nof brake fluid. Mixing different types (such\nas DOT 3 or 4 and DOT 5) can cause brake\nfailure. \n14 The brake master cylinder is mounted at\nthe left rear corner of the engine\ncompartment. The clutch fluid reservoir\n(manual transmission models) is mounted on\nthe right-hand side.\n15 To check the clutch fluid level, observe\nthe level through the translucent reservoir.\nThe level should be at or near the step\nmoulded into the reservoir. If the level is low,\nremove the reservoir cap to add the specified\nfluid (see illustration).\n16 The brake fluid level is checked by looking\nthrough the plastic reservoir mounted on the\nmaster cylinder (see illustration). The fluid\nlevel should be between the MAX and MIN\nlines on the reservoir. If the fluid level is low,\nfirst wipe the top of the reservoir and the cap\nwith a clean rag, to prevent contamination of\nthe system as the cap is unscrewed. Top-up\nwith the recommended brake fluid, but do not\noverfill. \n17 While the reservoir cap is off, check the\nmaster cylinder reservoir for contamination. If\nrust deposits, dirt particles or water droplets\nare present, the system should be drained\nand refilled.\n18 After filling the reservoir to the proper\nlevel, make sure the cap is seated correctly, to\nprevent fluid leakage and/or contamination. \n19 The fluid level in the master cylinder will\ndrop slightly as the disc brake pads wear.\nThere is no need to top up to compensate for\nthis fall provided that the level stays above the\nMIN line; the level will rise again when new\npads are fitted. A very low level may indicate\nworn brake pads. Check for wear (see Sec-\ntion 26).\n20 If the brake fluid level drops consistently,\ncheck the entire system for leaks immediately.\nExamine all brake lines, hoses and\nconnections, along with the calipers, wheel\ncylinders and master cylinder (see Sec-\ntion 26). \n21 When checking the fluid level, if you\ndiscover one or both reservoirs empty or\nnearly empty, the brake or clutch hydraulic\nsystem should be checked for leaks and bled\n(see Chapters 8 and 9).\nWindscreen washer fluid\n22 Fluid for the windscreen washer system is\nstored in a plastic reservoir in the engine\ncompartment (see illustration).\n23 In milder climates, plain water can be\nused in the reservoir, but it should be kept no\nmore than two-thirds full, to allow for\nexpansion if the water freezes. In colder\nclimates, use windscreen washer system\nantifreeze, available at any car accessory\nshop, to lower the freezing point of the fluid.\nThis comes in concentrated or pre-mixed\nform. If you purchase concentrated antifreeze,\nmix the antifreeze with water in accordance\nwith the manufacturer's directions on the\ncontainer.\nCaution: Do not use cooling\nsystem antifreeze - it will damage\nthe vehicle's paint. \n5 Tyre and tyre pressure\nchecks 1\n1 Periodic inspection of the tyres may save\nyou the inconvenience of being stranded with\na flat tyre. It can also provide you with vital\ninformation regarding possible problems in\nthe steering and suspension systems before\nmajor damage occurs. \n2 Tyres are equipped with bands that will\nappear when tread depth reaches 1.6 mm, at\nwhich time the tyres can be considered worn\nout. This represents the legal minimum tread\ndepth; most authorities recommend renewing\nany tyre on which the tread depth is 2 mm or\nless. Tread wear can be monitored with a\nsimple, inexpensive device known as a tread\ndepth indicator (see illustration). \n3 Note any abnormal tyre wear (see\nillustration overleaf). Tread pattern irregular-\nities such as cupping, flat spots and more\nwear on one side than the other are\nindications of front end alignment and/or\nwheel balance problems. If any of these\nconditions are noted, take the vehicle to a tyre\nspecialist to correct the problem. \n4 Look closely for cuts, punctures and\nembedded nails or tacks. Sometimes, after a\nnail has embedded itself in the tread, a tyre\nwill hold air pressure for a short time, or may\n1*9\n4.22  The windscreen washer fluid reservoir\nis located in the right front corner of the\nengine compartment on most models\n4.16  The brake fluid level should be kept\nabove the MIN mark on the translucent\nreservoir - unscrew the cap to add fluid\n4.15  Adding hydraulic fluid to the clutch\nfluid reservoir\n5.4a  If a slow puncture is suspected,\ncheck the valve core first to make sure it's\n5.2  Use a tyre tread depth indicator to\nmonitor tyre wear - they are available at\ncar accessory shops and service stations,\nand cost very little\n\n\nleak down very slowly. If a slow puncture\npersists, check the valve stem core to make\nsure it is tight (see illustration). Examine the\ntread for an object that may have embedded\nitself in the tyre, or for a previous repair that\nmay have begun to leak. If a puncture is\nsuspected, it can be easily verified by\nspraying a solution of soapy water onto the\npuncture (see illustration). The soapy\nsolution will bubble if there is a leak. Unless\nthe puncture is unusually large, a tyre\nspecialist can usually repair the tyre.\n5 Carefully inspect the inner sidewall of each\ntyre for evidence of brake fluid leakage. If you\nsee any, inspect the brakes immediately.\n6 Correct air pressure adds miles to the life\nspan of the tyres, improves fuel economy, and\nenhances overall ride quality. A tyre pressure\ngauge is essential.\n7 Always check the tyre pressures when the\ntyres are cold (ie before driving the vehicle).\nChecking the pressures when the tyres are\nwarm, or hot, will result in higher readings,\ndue to heat expansion. On no account should\nair be let out of the tyres in this case, or the\ntyres will effectively be under-inflated when\ncold.\n8 Unscrew the valve cap protruding from the\nwheel or hubcap, and push the gauge firmly\nonto the valve stem (see illustration). Note\nthe reading on the gauge, and compare the\nfigure to the recommended tyre pressures\nshown in the Specifications listed at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. Be sure to refit the\nvalve cap to keep dirt and moisture out of the\nvalve stem mechanism. Check all four tyres\nand, if necessary, add enough air to bring\nthem to the recommended pressure. \n9 Don't forget to keep the spare tyre inflated\nto the specified pressure.\n1*10\n5.8  To extend the life of the tyres, check\nthe air pressure at least once a week with\nan accurate gauge (don't forget the spare!)\n5.4b  If the valve core is tight, raise the\nvehicle, and spray a soapy water solution\nonto the tread as the tyre is turned slowly -\nleaks will cause small bubbles to appear\nTyre tread wear patterns\nShoulder Wear\nUnderinflation (wear on both sides)\nUnder-inflation will cause overheating of the\ntyre, because the tyre will flex too much, and\nthe tread will not sit correctly on the road\nsurface. This will cause a loss of grip and\nexcessive wear, not to mention the danger of\nsudden tyre failure due to heat build-up.\nCheck and adjust pressures\nIncorrect wheel camber (wear on one side)\nRepair or renew suspension parts\nHard cornering\nReduce speed!\nCentre Wear\nOverinflation\nOver-inflation will cause rapid wear of the\ncentre part of the tyre tread, coupled with\nreduced grip, harsher ride, and the danger of\nshock damage occurring in the tyre casing.\nCheck and adjust pressures\nIf you sometimes have to inflate your car's\ntyres to the higher pressures specified for\nmaximum load or sustained high speed, don't\nforget to reduce the pressures to normal\nafterwards.\nUneven  Wear\nFront tyres may wear unevenly as a result of\nwheel misalignment. Most tyre dealers and\ngarages can check and adjust the wheel\nalignment (or \"tracking\") for a modest charge.\nIncorrect camber or castor\nRepair or renew suspension parts\nMalfunctioning suspension\nRepair or renew suspension parts\nUnbalanced wheel\nBalance tyres\nIncorrect toe setting\nAdjust front wheel alignment\nNote: The feathered edge of the tread which\ntypifies toe wear is best checked by feel.\nWeekly Checks\nKeep an accurate gauge in\nthe glove compartment. The\npressure gauges attached to\nthe nozzles of air hoses at\nservice stations are often\ninaccurate.",
