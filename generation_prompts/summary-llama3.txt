- Use the language and style of the original text but avoid copying spelling mistakes or errors.
- Optimize the summary for keywords to be easily searchable.
- The year, era, date, or some other indicator of the freshness of the information should be prioritized if written in the text.
- Numbers, makes,  models, names, model years, dates, and other specific information should be prioritized.

{{text}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
