### Task instructions:

Create questions derived from the user message.

- Conversational speech acts that can be asked in passing or as part of a conversation.

- Detailed speech acts that would require a more in-depth response.

- Speech acts that are not related on the surface but a response could be derived from the notes.

Each instruction, question, or request and its reversed form pairing should be self-contained and not require context to understand such that it could be asked in any order.
The instructions should provoke a conversation or response from the receiver rather than being rhetorical, a statement, or a command.
Ensure that the questions is in some way relevant to the notes provided, a specific item, name, or concept mentioned in the notes.
Use the notes context to fill in any missing information or to provide additional context for the questions.

If the speech act relates to an item mention its make or model along with a date if applicable. Examples:

Dont say: How do I replace the alternator on my F-150?
Say: How do I replace the alternator on my 2015 Ford F-150 with the 3.5L V6 engine?

Dont say: My rifle has been jamming, how do I fix it?
Say: My PTR 91 has been jamming when I use steel case ammo, how do I fix it?

Dont say: Write a step by step comparison of the 2015 macbook pro and the 2016 macbook pro.
Say: Write a step by step comparison of the 2015 13-inch Macbook Pro with the 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 and the 2016 13-inch Macbook Pro with the 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5.
